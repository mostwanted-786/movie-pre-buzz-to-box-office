The Truth,"['Funny, wry, emotionally potent, and like most films by Hirokazu Kore-eda operates on multiple levels -- usually some kind of domestic tragicomedy under which lies profound existential disquiet.', ""The Truth has flaws, and it feels small-screen to me, although I suppose that's true of every movie that comes out right now. But Catherine Deneuve is a total delight as the fabulous, frank Fabienne."", ""Using compassion and the slightest touch of syrup, Kore-eda brings his characters to a place where they realize with shock that they're finally on the same page."", 'It feels like Koreeda used his awesome clout to make the kind of standard picture that we get a dozen of every year.', ""It's gentle and a little wistful... It's fine, which is not what you expect to say with the people involved, but I enjoyed it."", ""The new film returns to some of Kore-eda's favorite themes of responsibility, legacy, and the fluidity of roles between parents and children."", 'The Truth is an unassuming picture, but like Fabienne, it leaves a lasting impression.', ""Everything - every scene, every line of dialogue - feels like it's working toward a point. Which, when you think about it, is a good way to never actually make a point."", 'The Truth is layered and offers a treat for those who savor acting on the highest level, but it is a step down from his best films and may hold its strongest appeal for those who label themselves cineastes and art house movie-lovers.', 'In ""The Truth,"" the Japanese writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda wittily toys with Deneuve\'s persona, its layers and meanings.', ""Binoche is very good here, but this is definitely Deneuve's show."", ""If anyone can handle The Truth, it's Deneuve."", '...intermittently extraordinary...', 'While the performances are total delights, there remains the nagging feeling that Kore-eda is not working at his peak.', ""You don't want to this thrilling standoff between two French legends-Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche -who are double dynamite as a mother and daughter with different ideas of what constitutes the truth."", ""If and when there's an Oscar ceremony, there ought to be considerable talk about Catherine Deneuve and her regal performance in The Truth."", 'Master Japanese writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda makes a seamless transition to French-language cinema, filming in and around Paris and successfully importing his feel for complicated family dynamics...', ""It's good to see Kore-eda try to stretch himself a little, and The Truth demonstrates that his talent can survive on foreign soil. But there's not as much powerful emotional veracity to it as one might hope."", ""Kore-eda's film... is nonetheless a quiet, Gallic gift to these orphans in the dark who are forever sorting through old stories and new movies in an attempt to find beauty in both the truth and the lies."", ""Deneuve is mesmerising, but I was also sometimes irritated, particularly by the wistful piano music that would never shut up. It is worth seeing but not, perhaps, as much as Kore-eda's other films, which you would do well to search out online."", ""There's a real beguiling, naturalistic performance, even when the central character is insufferable in so many ways..."", 'Catherine Deneuve is so good it hurts in this dramedy from Japanese auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda.', ""[Catherine] Deneuve brings plenty of Gallic charm and wit to the table, though the film's concerns are still strictly [Hirokazu] Kore-eda's."", '""What matters most is personality! Presence!"" she declares, determined not to fade into obscurity. Deneuve\'s luminous performance ensures she won\'t.', ""The Truth is Kore-eda's first non-Japanese film... but any problems it has can't be blamed on cultural misunderstandings so much as the material's flimsiness and its overfamiliar allusions."", 'This movie is an absorbing serio-comic flourish.', ""There's wry humour, deliciously spiky exchanges and wistful tenderness but it's more about the slow accretion of moments than all-out weepiness."", ""There's much to relish here."", ""While The Truth isn't as refined or free-flowing as Kore-eda's other films, there is complexity and charm to it, and to Deneuve's performance."", 'It feels like a chamber piece because it is: a chance for the director to observe an ocean-going star in all her glory, to see what he can do as her captain.', ""The Truth is, predictably, a movie about lies, but more so about memory and perception. It's an ambitious feat for Kore-eda, but in that ambition a lot of his ability to write a tender family drama, such as his Oscar-nominated Shoplifters, is muddled."", ""The Truth, like so much of Kore-eda's work, is fundamentally minor; it has one of those slightly maudlin piano scores that he favors, much too blatantly announcing the wistfulness."", ""Foreign auteurs often go astray as they make their way to the West, and it's a relief that Kore-eda's approach to delicate family dynamics spans the language barrier, though hardly a surprise."", 'The tactility of earlier Hirokazu Kore-eda imagery has been traded for a softer, more luscious, nevertheless melancholic dream world.', 'This wise and diaphanous little drama finds Kore-eda once again exploring his usual obsessions...yet another insightful look at the underlying fabric of a modern family.', ""One of Deneuve's greatest performances, with Kore-eda transforming the magisterial persona she frequently supplies to other directors into something more complex, tragic and yet defiant. She deserves awards for it. And so does the film."", 'Even working in another language and on another continent, Kore-eda once again captures the intricacies of the human condition.', ""It has the playful lightness of touch, the wit and warmth that are an essential part of the Kore-eda signature; it's also an affectionate ode to French cinema itself..."", ""From first shot to last, it's a film of high wit and confidence and verve, an astonishingly fluid and accomplished act of boundary-leaping."", 'The Truth is a witty, meta dramedy about self-mythologizing, a portrait of a wonderfully impossible woman, and a vehicle for a stellar late-career performance from Catherine Deneuve.', ""Yes, Kore-eda's tale is warm and soothing, verging on over-cosy. But it contains a hard core of emotional truth, like the pea beneath the mattress that woke up the princess."", 'A keenly observed, wit-stippled drama of extended family life...']"
Titanic,"['My favorite line in the movie comes from Kathy Bates’ Molly Brown, who instantly sizes up the tension between Billy Zane’s arrogant Cal and his betrothed Rose...', '... a guilty-pleasure tear-jerker.', 'Titanic is, in the end, and despite being prohibited to those under 12 years old, a film for children of all ages, for those ready to gasp at a parade of wonders and eager to be swept away.', 'Cameron has filled this saga almost to the bursting point with stories and themes that stretch from romance to expose, from parables of hubris to celebrations of industry. This is a great, sprawling film because it urgently needs to be so.', ""Ultimately, it is Cameron's overweening ambition to overlay a grand journey of the human spirit atop all the thrills, spills and clinches that hobbles his epic, rendering it enjoyable but mediocre."", ""Strap on your life vests and dive on in: It's wonderful hokum."", ""Visually, the movie is undeniably impressive; there's no question where all the money went. As love stories go, this one is solid, but it's a long way short of special."", 'Cameron has amplified and elaborated, and it has to be said, in circumstances like these, bigness has its own fascination.', ""Winslet is breathtakingly vivid in her emotional transparency. She easily masters the American accent as well as a young upper-class girl's petulant pride."", ""At least we know there won't be a sequel."", ""Cameron's attention to detail in the smaller, human moments makes the eye-popping visual effects work, and the performances of DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are affecting even when the pair is just running though water."", ""Is Titanic worth your $6 price of admission? Absolutely. It's a spectacular disaster film nested inside a superior drama about great love and great loss."", 'Interpreting the tragedy as a tale of two people who find love a bit late in the day sounds fine in theory. But what about the many hundreds who simply found death? They remain computerised flotsam and jetsam.', 'The ingenious Cameron and his effects team have creating indelible, realistic images... Where Titanic springs its leaks is in the creating of indelible or realistic people.', ""Cameron excels at big scenes and muscular action; it's the little things, such as emotional nuance and complicated characters, that he can't manage well."", 'Forget Celine Dion’s infernal heart. This movie just goes on and on.', 'For all the sluggish script and the enormous weight of the special effects, this movie behemoth still has the power to shake us rigid and and touch the soul.', '[The ending] is a masterpiece of popcorn tragedy: not deep, not sophisticated, barely even credible, but gut-clutching for those of us who have already lost the sensible use of our stomachs, as we would in any worthwhile fairground ride.', ""The movie is a ride, and not without the odd moment of corniness. But it's also about freedom and flight, bondage and stagnation. And most fittingly, as a memorial itself, it's about memory and the act of remembering."", 'No meager disaster movie, greased by generic formula and goosed by big-bucks technology... Titanic is one big, bruising movie that will appeal on different levels to different audiences.', ""Cameron's aim was to set the most intimate love story possible against one of the century's biggest tragedies, and he very nearly pulls it off. DiCaprio has a captivating presence in a role that might have been written for a young Clark Gable."", 'What I can tell you, risking puns, is that it swept me off my feet almost from the get-go, a grand epic romance-disaster that reminded me, in the middle of my overstuffed-with-movies life, of what we mean when we talk about the power of cinema.', ""Sure, 'Titanic' may be corny, clumsy, and obvious-but the sincerity of its emotions and the power of its spectacle endure."", ""Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully."", 'If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.', 'The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.', 'Titanic provides an absorbing blend of historical fact and old-fashioned Hollywood tearjerking.', 'Titanic is indeed a ship of dreams. Climb aboard and bon voyage.', ""Take one of history's most compelling tragedies, tell it through the lives of two engaging young lovers and show it with some of the best-ever special effects and you have a dazzling, exciting movie that is also poignant and personal."", 'With his beatific, sweet, open face, DiCaprio gives us a rooting interest in hoping that someone important to us survives the wreck.', ""We know the story ends badly but Cameron still sweeps us up in the romance between Kate Winslet's rebellious posh girl and DiCaprio's steerage kid."", 'It has itself become, like the shipwreck, a cultural monument, only accreting value, not losing significance, as time goes by.', ""Cameron's three-hour disaster epic is a triumph of popular art -- of folk art, really."", '""Titanic"" still amazes as the kind of massive, build-and-destroy production that few filmmakers have the ambition or budget to make.', '[Cameron] stages the sinking with a flawless sense of detail, pacing, import and dread.', 'For all of its flaws, this movie works in the way that classic Hollywood movies do. It delivers.', 'Only the snobbish or the obtuse could deny its ambition, verve and entertainment firepower.', 'This version has deepened and enriched a film that was already rich in emotions and remarkable for its depth of detail.', 'How is Titanic in 3D? The answer is pretty damn dazzling.', ""If you fancy indulging in pure, unadulterated silliness and spending a night in the '90s, this is a good bet. Otherwise..."", 'Cameron is a genius at instilling narrative dread and designing a hokum-drenched fairy tale of a certain size.', 'If any film should be redone in 3-D, it\'s ""Titanic."" And if any filmmaker should be the one doing the redoing, it\'s James Cameron.', ""With a 3D conversion from the medium's pioneer-in-chief, Titanic is a big-screen romance that's every bit as epic as you remember."", ""The re-release is keenly timed with the 100th anniversary of the actual sinking of the RMS Titanic, yet another factor to validate the 3D film's existence."", ""Sure, it's corny, but there's something endearing about the tale of young love and its earnest lack of irony."", ""Cameron's detractors grouse about his use of scale and spectacle to invest archetypal, even clichd stories with an extra, unearned emotional significance. They're absolutely right, with one crucial caveat: there's absolutely nothing unearned about it."", 'Like Kathy Bates\' ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, ""Titanic"" is unabashedly American: It\'s big, brash and sometimes gauche, yet also unapologetically earnest, amazing to look at and devoted to its own cause. And it knows how to win us over.', 'Overall, for a blockbuster movie about one great big thing hitting another great big thing, the new film shows distinctly upper-deck restraint.', ""The letdown factor has been most keenly felt in conversions from 2D, but Titanic 3D shows how the ambition can be realized if the will and skill are there. We can only hope that other filmmakers follow Cameron's example."", 'But the power of Titanic didn\'t come from originality; it came from punching cliches across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart, ""old-fashioned,"" or plain corny, depending on your perspective.', 'James Cameron\'s spectacular new 3-D version of ""Titanic\'\' is everything I\'d hoped for, and more.', 'Here is a rare opportunity to return to something you once loved, and discover it still holds up, no apologies necessary.', 'Turns out hubris and greed float, like sorrow.', 'Now it can be told: The Titanic went down because of two distracting smoochers on the poop deck.', 'A spectacular demonstration of what modern technology can contribute to dramatic storytelling.', 'Titanic is a good, often stunning movie caught in a three-and-a-half hour drift.', 'Cameron captures the majesty, the tragedy, the fury and the futility of the event in a way that supersedes his trivial attempts to melodramatize it.', 'Titanic is big, bold, touchingly uncynical filmmaking.', ""Titanic runs well enough in the backstretch of intrigue and contrivance to cross the finish line well ahead of all but a few of the screen's superspectacles in this century."", 'Perhaps the most melancholy thing about Titanic is its celebration of romantic ideals to the exclusion of such self-denying virtues as honor, duty, and heroism.', 'Cost: well over $200m. Disregarding the ethics of such expenditure on a film, this unprecedented extravagance has not resulted in sophisticated or even very satisfying storytelling.', 'A grand and classy production.', ""It's something of an ingenuous revision of the standard disaster movie."", ""Titanic is awesome even when it's awful -- you can't take your eyes off the extraordinary thing."", ""Despite its failings it's hard not to become swept up in the sheer grandeur of Titanic."", 'A hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances, a movie that reeks of phoniness and lacks even minimal originality.', 'James Cameron has gone and delivered a spectacular, moving, utterly engrossing three-and-a-bit hour epic.', 'The would-be emotional centerpiece of his three-hours-plus adventure flick is the most juvenile romantic tale of 1997.', ""As spectacle, Titanic sets a new standard; as romantic drama, it's substandard."", 'Titanic is a film that sweeps us away into a world of spectacle, beauty and excitement.', 'The disaster is definitely worth the wait.', ""No other film has made the horror of the ship's sinking so palpable, and none other has dared to dramatize the night of the living dead that followed after it sank beneath the North Atlantic."", ""It's still by far and away a grand, gorgeous, breathtaking spectacle."", 'Credit Cameron for locating that latitude-longitude spot where haunting loss intersects with sheer cinematic braggadocio. His movie may not be perfect, but visually and viscerally, it pretty well is.', 'A lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom.', ""You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it."", 'Titanic is big-budget spectacle and director Cameron brings it off with high-tech bravura, placing us aboard the ship in real time.', 'The regretful verdict here: dead in the water.', ""The last hour of Titanic is huge and staggering, but there's no horror in it."", 'Like it or hate it, Titanic lives and breathes as a piece of pure cinema.', 'Bursting through gaps in the hull, rushing down corridors, licking at rooms, triumphing over great ballrooms and tiny closets, down stairways and into elevators, the sea, in the hands of Cameron and his technical associates, becomes hungry, vindictive.', ""There's a lot to like here."", ""Titanic will give you your money's worth."", ""Cameron succeeds magically in linking his film's young lovers, played enchantingly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet."", 'The movie raises important questions about choices faced by the characters.', 'Glub glub glub.', 'All things considered, Titanic is old-fashioned epic filmmaking that carries a wallop.', ""James Cameron's 194-minute, $200 million film of the tragic voyage is in the tradition of the great Hollywood epics. It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted and spellbinding.""]"
Burden,"['Like Green Book, The Blind Side, The Soloist and so on, Burden fits too snugly into the white-saviour mode of storytelling. Which is a shame, because everyone involved here is doing their best in trying to craft layered characters with compelling agendas.', ""What is Burden teaching us or telling us about race in America that we don't already know from decades of history or decades of cinema?"", '""Burden"" does a great job of giving the viewer a look at the lives of those in the KKK beyond their hatred, but it misses the mark on making an impact on the viewer.', '""Burden"" is a film of integrity, with something even better than a social conscience. It has a social purpose. If you see it, you\'ll learn something.', 'Writer and director Andrew Heckler has managed to make a powerful film, if not a very subtle one.', ""[Garrett Hedlund's] performance is 70 percent just him swaying back and forth. I never found him to be at all convincing."", ""I think it has a great cast and there are some good performances, but I thought at times the direction wasn't great and it veered into that white savior territory."", ""We're going to make an entire movie about the redemption of one guy in the Klan? I just don't think that's where the effort should go even if it should turn out as a fairly decent effort in the filmmaking itself."", 'Overall, Burden is too long and many of its beats have been appropriated from other movies about Southern racism.', 'The sense that a lot of these characters have been reduced to their narrative purpose destroys the world that Burden needed to create to work.', 'A compelling true story about the redemption of a Klansman (a very fine Garrett Hedlund) is well-intentioned but dramatically wobbly and simplistic.', 'Siding with the angels can seem like a snap in films, but ""Burden"" has the grace to show how difficult and wrenching a choice that can be.', ""But that's the extent of the thoughtfulness in this overly simplistic piece of Southern poverty porn, which asks questions it's not really prepared to answer and proceeds from a set of dubious assumptions that undermine whatever nuance it does possess."", 'Though the themes of ""Burden"" feel uncomfortably current, their execution is leaden and dismayingly artless.', ""Production design from Stephanie Hamilton is another highlight, and the film feels pulled directly out of a very specific time and place; Jeremy Rouse's cinematography is gorgeous without being at all showy."", ""Its narrative focus leans the movie toward having more of a white-savior complex, even though that does make Garrett Hedlund's portrayal of Burden a very complicated type of hero."", ""Hedlund leans so heavily on Mike's bobbing physicality that the audience nearly gets seasick. Still, it's an unselfish performance from a strong young actor who's been devoting his career to tough parts that don't ask for applause."", ""The writer-director's inexperience behind the camera is all too evident, as the painful but ultimately cathartic tale bumps along for more than two hours without ever finding an aesthetic form.""]"
A Hidden Life,"['Watching A Hidden Life feels like both going to church and performing penance, like Terrence Malick wants us to submit to the same ideological journey as his protagonist.', ""A Hidden Life is definitely on the long side, and there will be people whose patience may be exhausted, but if you give yourself over to it, it's a moving, emotional film with truly breathtaking visuals and wonderful performances."", 'There is no doubt that A Hidden Life is a labour of love for Malick, but it will prove a challenge for audiences willing to experience the latest work of this most interesting and wayward director.', ""How does someone retain their innocence in an inescapably dark time? It's a painful question, but [Terrence] Malick's film is brave enough to ask it."", 'The drama lacks inner tension. Rather than wrestling with himself, as other Malick heroes do, Franz remains a noble waxwork helplessly true to his own convictions.', 'Malick links the lonely labour of working the land with the thanklessness of sainthood, asking questions about devotion, tradition and individual acts of resistance.', ""It is the best thing he's done in a long time, and it is very very Terrence Malick, for all the good and bad that that means."", 'It does have a certain hypnotic, cumulative power - it may just be all those mountains - if you can stick with it. But there is no guarantee that you will be able to.', 'An exquisitely emotional and thorough account of an individual resisting state fascism.', ""Eyes may instinctively roll at Malick's fixation with magical dawn and dusk light - confronted by real darkness, the result is his best film in years."", ""If you don't like Malick's movies, A Hidden Life won't convert you. But this is the filmmaker on sublime form, putting his artistry and obsessions at the service of something frighteningly relevant."", 'Despite its faults, the film does indeed succeed in being a species of religious experience. It has a powerful sense of the immanence of life.', ""You admire this man and his devotion. You're enraged by this man because nobody in the world will know or care about his sacrifice..."", '""A Hidden Life"" is indisputably the finest work Malick has produced in eight years, as an examination of faith, conviction and sacrifice, but also as proof of concept for his own idiosyncratic style.', ""It's about faith, pure and simple - though, in the end, A Hidden Life is anything but."", ""It's an environmental daydream and a human nightmare rolled into one, Mother Nature vs. human nature, and Malick delivers it with purpose."", ""You can imagine how other filmmakers might approach this - it's a beautifully cinematic story - but no one else would film it quite as Malick has."", '""A Hidden Life"" is less a story than an experience, a spiritual journey made accessible through light and sound. Malick doesn\'t transcend cinema. He sanctifies it.', ""[August] Diehl's performance is a model of restraint; he more often imparts information by a look, a glance, the slump of his shoulders, than he does with a spoken word."", ""It quietly demands viewers wind down to become in sync with Jägerstätter's rural life, a world of planting and harvesting, back-breaking labor and joyous celebration, community and kinship."", ""The film is overlong but worthy, with Malick's by-now-standard cinematic tics - couples frolicking idyllically in meadows, murmured pensees on the soundtrack - gathering a great and righteous weight."", ""There is familiarity here, but sincerity too. This is all part of Malick's cinematic forever quest for truth and beauty amidst a world that prefers lies and vulgarity - we can choose to continue alongside, or drop off."", ""Malick's movie is deeply open-hearted, metaphysical and ruminative.

A true act of resistance should crack our universe open."", 'With A Hidden Life and the story of Franz Jägerstätter, the director has found the ideal vehicle for his cosmic inquiries, and has created a film that is mournful, memorable and emotionally exhilarating.', ""As usual, Malick's style of storytelling is roundabout and allusive, but this time it seldom stalls."", '[An] earnest, gorgeous, at times frustrating film.', 'A Hidden Life is another Terrence Malick nature poem, transforming a true tale of conscientious objection into a ravishing portrait of goodness in a time of tyranny.', 'An ecstatic, anguished three-hour cinematic hymn ... I am awed by parts of The New World, The Tree of Life and To The Wonder; A Hidden Life overwhelms me in its totality.', ""Malick's return to form with the true story of a WW2 pacifist still seems like a miss as his focus drifts off into gorgeous shots of mountain mists, chirping birds and babbling brooks that add up to three hours of digressive meanderings."", 'When a giant stumbles, the thud is colossal.', 'A masterpiece of storytelling becomes a fitting tribute to those who remain principled and defiant.', 'Malick falls prey yet again to the voice-over whispering and dreamy cloud-watching he relies on too much.', ""The film is almost a tone poem, focusing on conveying Franz and Fani's emotions as they experience an event that barely registered during the war but is life-altering for them."", 'Gobsmacking camerawork, dreamlike editing, whispering dialogue and poetic ruminations, sure, but if you’re after gags you have come to the wrong place.', ""The lasting message is that faith, familial love and nature's capacity for renewal outlast even the darkest times - and it comes through loud and clear. Malickites will no doubt be delighted."", ""A Hidden Life is a work of genius, at last a justification of Malick's late style."", ""Terrence Malick's film means to seek out souls caught in the tide of history, but which move against its current."", ""This show of faith hasn't come a moment too soon."", ""A Hidden Life is everything [Terrence] Malick's devotees could want from a movie: beautiful, poetic, hewing closely to films like Days of Heaven and Tree of Life."", '[It] may be visually beautiful, in a mountains-in-the-mist way.

And as Rhiannon, the appealing Angourie Rice is just the kind of teenager you root for ...""]"
Colette,"['The beautifully lush late 19th century settings show off the remarkable modernity of the writer, actress, dancer, and iconoclast Collette.', ""The movie's treatment of her same-sex affairs may be as tasteful as the set design, but the film is an absorbing introduction to a trailblazing artist."", 'Keira Knightley is magnetic in a Paris-set period drama with a dollop of queer feminist energy.', '[Keira Knightley] gets far more to do and is infinitely better at it than usual in the brisk new period piece Colette', ""In the wrong films Knightley is a pretty girl with a small bag of tricks.
