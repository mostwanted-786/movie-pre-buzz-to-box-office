Oppenheimer both summons awe for what it took to build the bomb and for the changes it wrought.', 'As he corrals the world‚Äôs scientists to follow behind him Robert Oppenheimer is magnetic, more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat.', ""[Nolan] captures that theoretical aspect of Oppenheimer on the screen in very personal moments... that energy, that swirl of passion in the unknown it's all there, and it is phenomenal to watch."", 'Christopher Nolan‚Äôs newest film is jarring and memorable, an ode to creation and consequence.', 'Everything about Christopher Nolan‚Äôs latest movie is massive. The level of shock and awe is breathtaking, but it can also be taxing.', 'Befitting his paradigm-shattering protagonist, Nolan so audaciously merges form and content that he completely upends the ‚Äògreat-man‚Äô biopic.', 'Starring Cillian Murphy, and his cheekbones, the film is dense, ambitious, complex, so very long (three hours) and impressive, even if it does drag by the end.', 'Thanks to Nolan and Murphy, we see the full Oppenheimer -- neither monster nor savior, victim nor villain, but in the end, just a man.', 'This is a very heady, brainy spectacle. A thesis. A portrait of a genius, his triumphs and shame.', 'The movie is as sluggish as if Nolan were underlining the script‚Äôs most salient passages onscreen...', 'This is a film with intelligence, purpose and historic value.', 'It‚Äôs a movie like no other, dragging us into the collective guilt of history.', 'For the most part, the film is a towering achievement.', '... scientific and historical accuracy are key. Fortunately for fans of both, ""Oppenheimer"" delivers in telling the truth about the story of the Manhattan Project, at least as much as can be expected of a Hollywood blockbuster.', 'Nolan‚Äôs Oppenheimer barely qualifies as a biopic... Instead it‚Äôs a movie investigating the nature of power: how it is created, how it is kept in balance, and how it leads people into murky quandaries that refuse simplistic answers.', 'Christopher Nolan‚Äôs blockbuster captures the scientific triumphs and monstrous sins of the Manhattan Project.', 'Not since The Master, perhaps, has a filmmaker used the large gauge to such intimate effect, making a vast canvas from one man‚Äôs troubled features.', 'Nolan discards the dates and details of traditional biopic storytelling, which is a frustrating if evocative choice. He thrusts us headlong and simultaneously into the advent and fallout of the nuclear arms race with [a] nagging insistence', 'A story of ordinary men and women caught up in extraordinary times. What they created really did ‚Äúchange the world,‚Äù but no one here rises to the level of hero, or even tragic hero, and even the villainy on display is more vanity than anything else.', 'Perhaps in trimming the story to three hours, some of the male-female narrative connective tissue was cut, which may be why, for all its fascinating moving parts, the busy biopic isn‚Äôt more emotionally explosive.', 'Perhaps inevitably, it falls short of its ambitions. But it‚Äôs bracing to see a studio movie these days, particularly one with such huge scope, that at least attempts to serve up more than recycled goods.', ""Nolan's time-hopping structure works brilliantly in a film about men who compartmentalize their jobs as well as their being - separating ambition from morality - to propel science forward and set humanity back. Last act fumbles a jerry-rigged catharsis."", 'Nolan has set out to make a moral epic, and he succeeds for the most part, or, rather, for the first two thirds of ‚ÄúOppenheimer,‚Äù which contains some of the finest, most galvanizing moviemaking of his career.', 'Nolan‚Äôs film... is one I couldn‚Äôt help but admire, even if, like the observers of the Trinity test, I could observe it only from a distance, at once awed and ambivalent.', 'Christopher Nolan deserves every superlative for his take on J. Robert Oppenheimer (a flawless Cillian Murphy), the dark knight of the atomic age. This terrifying, transfixing epic emerges as a monumental achievement on the march into screen history.', 'Nolan has crafted something so exhilarating that its more maddening aspects can‚Äôt help but stick out like a sore thumb, and I‚Äôll be curious to discover if my opinion of the finished product improves or diminishes on a second watch.', 'Mr. Nolan‚Äôs utterly enthralling film lasts three hours. But despite being as talky as a math seminar, it crackles, hurtles and whooshes, generating more suspense and excitement than anything found in the alleged climaxes of the recent superhero pictures.', ""Nolan's film illuminates not only the intellectual life and complicated legacy of one of America‚Äôs most consequential scientific minds but also the array of opposing, divided systems that drove his ambition and determined his actions."", 'Nolan isn\'t interested in scaling down or tidying up. Heck, no one expects a bomb to go off cleanly, and there\'s plenty to sift through in ""Oppenheimer\'s"" shrapnel. People will likely be going through it for years.', 'With its everyone-and-the-kitchen-sink casting, alternating between color and black and white, fit-for-Imax spectacle and Ludwig G√∂ransson‚Äôs pounding musical score, Oppenheimer seeks to overwhelm the audience, an approach that works to an extent.', 'At three hours, it is too long -- as, sigh, all films are these days -- but compared with the dimension-bending twists and trickery of the films that made Nolan a superstar director, Oppenheimer feels classier, more serious.', 'If Hollywood is ending as we know it ‚Äì and all signs on that question point to a strong ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù ‚Äì then Oppenheimer is the ideal movie to finish us all.', 'Despite being overlong and unevenly paced, Oppenheimer contains moments of greatness and features one of the most compelling lead performances (by Cillian Murphy) in recent memory.', 'The movie is so vigorously directed, not only in terms of sight but also sound, that probably the best a critic can do is point you toward the experience and say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that.‚Äù', 'However you choose to view ‚ÄúOppenheimer,‚Äù it‚Äôs the picture of a man who reaped everything he sowed.', 'What I can say for sure is that ‚ÄúOppenheimer‚Äù far too often feels like a three-hour Wikipedia entry than a compelling movie.', ""Though they may seem disparate, the many elements of Oppenheimer refract and reflect each other, like a bunch of atoms creating a chain reaction or a group of scientists building off each other's ideas to forge something new."", 'Either despite its intense craft or because of it, Oppenheimer works.', 'For all we learn about the creation and execution of the atomic bomb and its aftermath, the story could and should be told in a more digestible form. Instead, we have an overlong narrative that isn‚Äôt revelatory or surprising.', 'Elevated by Cillian Murphy‚Äôs exacting performance, Nolan‚Äôs biopic on the father of the atomic bomb is majestic and morally complex.', 'This is dense material that‚Äôs thoroughly engrossing and by its end, shattering.', 'Murphy‚Äôs eerily handsome face, made up of angles and shadows and eyes that always seem to be telling a story that‚Äôs different from the one he‚Äôs speaking, is the film‚Äôs foundation, and his layered performance is its anchor.', 'It‚Äôs Christopher Nolan‚Äôs best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain.', 'It‚Äôs more impressive for how the director has made such a personal narrative feel epic, not just in visual breadth but in dramatic sweep, presenting a story from the past that feels knotted to so many present anxieties about nuclear annihilation.', 'As a physical experience, ""Oppenheimer"" is something else entirely‚Äîit\'s hard to say exactly what, and that\'s what\'s so fascinating about it.', 'My patience wore thin as the director gave into one of his favorite indulgences: a bleeding soundscape.', ""Nolan's best film to date and a spectacular achievement for cinema."", 'Oppenheimer is like atomic physics: Each tiny spark interlocks to create a massive, breathtaking, terrifying, conflagration.', 'Christopher Nolan has done it again. He‚Äôs taken a historical story we know a bit about and turned it into an edge-of-the-seat, heart-in-the-mouth drama.', 'This is a film about terrible risks and a planet likely destined to destroy itself someday. And we see it, and feel it.', 'The simultaneously old-school and new-school gorgeousness of Oppenheimer can‚Äôt be overstressed.', '[An] often laborious yet genuinely strange and gripping movie -- a grand spectacle inspired by some of the grimmest events in human history, and itself an invention meant to blow us all away.', 'Its best moments stand out as some of the most original and exciting filmmaking of the year, highs that do a lot to counterbalance the sequences which dive back into bureaucracy and comparatively petty rivalries.', 'Downey is the crucial supporting player, and he gives a shrewd, dynamic performance as the wily, insecure, powerful Strauss.', 'Nolan taps the full sensory potential of moviemaking, pushing picture and sound to meet the scale of the story: clever lines dot the script; the whole project is admirably willing to wrestle with matters of great weight through cinema.', '‚ÄúOppenheimer‚Äù is a great achievement in formal and conceptual terms, and fully absorbing, but Nolan‚Äôs filmmaking is, crucially, in service to the history that it relates.', '[Nolan] has brought to life not just J. Robert Oppenheimer, but the still-crucial arguments he both started and tried to end. Oppenheimer boldly posits that those arguments are still worth having, in a film of magnitude, profundity and dazzling artistry.', 'Nolan demonstrates his usual prowess for impeccable visuals and stunning craftsmanship within a deeply despairing portrait of an arrogant genius who, too late, realised the impact of his monstrous creation.', 'Oppenheimer is a movie with power, texture and grace. By the end, we begin to understand its subject, even if we remain baffled by a genius who somehow divorced himself from the damage his theoretical project would do.', 'The movie around Murphy is simultaneously breathtaking and mind-melding.', 'Simultaneously a biography, a mystery, a polemic, and a dense character study, Oppenheimer feels like the film Christopher Nolan has been preparing to make his entire career, and it may very well be his best work.', 'That rare summer movie with ideas as big as its ambition and budget...But ""Oppenheimer"" isn\'t a movie that is dependent on special effects for its power. In a film aimed squarely at adults, Nolan keeps the focus as much on the man as the magic.', 'One of the many satisfactions of Oppenheimer, Nolan‚Äôs intellectually thrilling and morally despairing new film, is that it succeeds in locating some of those conventions within another of his ingeniously constructed narrative labyrinths.', 'Only Nolan could make this potentially forbidding subject matter so thrilling.', 'Any filmmaker can create a cinematic universe. (Many have. Too many, some might say.) Very few can show you how a genius perceives the building blocks of our universe, right before that same person imagines something that threatens our existence in it.', 'The acting is uniformly brilliant, with Murphy, Downey and Blunt simply astounding.', 'The filmmaker‚Äôs technique generally counterpoints any caveats and script imperfections. The ensemble cast is starry and strong. ... ‚ÄúBrilliance makes up for a lot,‚Äù Murphy‚Äôs Oppenheimer tells us. It sure does.', 'Magnificent. Christopher Nolan‚Äôs three-hour historical biopic Oppenheimer is a gorgeously photographed, brilliantly acted, masterfully edited and thoroughly engrossing epic that instantly takes its place among the finest films of this decade.', ""A juggernaut historical biopic that you'll want to see again asap, even if it doesn‚Äôt all work on the first sweep."", 'It‚Äôs at once a speeding roller-coaster and a skin-tingling spiritual portrait; an often classically minded period piece that only Nolan could have made, and only now, after a quarter-century‚Äôs run-up.', 'Large swathes of the film play out as political thriller, the fuel in its engine being Downey Jr‚Äôs titanic colouring of Strauss, all boorishness and manipulative charm.', 'Oppenheimer joins the ranks of Christopher Nolan‚Äôs best work not for preserving some essential inexplicability of nuclear physics but by undermining the idea of science‚Äôs objectivity.', 'A masterfully constructed character study from a great director operating on a whole new level. A film that you don‚Äôt merely watch, but must reckon with.', 'Cillian Murphy turns in a haunting career-best performance as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Robert Downey Jr. astounds in a way we haven‚Äôt seen in quite some time.', 'Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Oppenheimer is a kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty that quakes with the disquieting tremors of a forever rupture in the course of human history.', 'Like its protagonist, Oppenheimer is a work in constant conflict with itself, with most of its problems rooted in Nolan‚Äôs screenplay.', 'Oppenheimer is a movie that makes you say ‚ÄúOh my God‚Äù over and over again -- in awe and in terror.', 'Oppenheimer is a tour de force. An unmatched director at the top of his game throwing off the shackles of science fiction and superheroes to tell the raw story of one man‚Äôs transformation into something both more and less than a human being.', 'Cillian Murphy, with a thousand-yard beam, the half-smile of an intellectual rake, and a way of keeping everything close to the vest, gives a phenomenal performance as Oppenheimer, making him fascinating and multi-layered.', 'Its scope comes from Murphy‚Äôs haunted performance, and the way that the movie (with help from Ludwig G√∂ransson‚Äôs panic attack of a score) submerges you in the mindset of its protagonist as though it can create a psychic connection to the past.', 'Oppenheimer is a mainstream offering of uncommon resonance, sending the viewer out of the theater head-spun and itchy-eyed, ears ringing from all its sophisticated, voluble explosion.', 'Intelligent non-IP-driven filmmaking on a scale we simply don‚Äôt see in movie theaters anymore.', 'This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan.', 'This is a big, ballsy, serious-minded cinematic event of a type now virtually extinct from the studios. It fully embraces the contradictions of an intellectual giant who was also a deeply flawed man.', 'The most breathtaking film of the year.', '‚ÄúOppenheimer‚Äù offers an indelible portrait of the age when people began wielding power they couldn‚Äôt necessarily control, and few movies have so disturbingly crystallized the horror of opening Pandora‚Äôs box.', 'A divided epic of awe and horror, fission and fusion. It‚Äôs simultaneously a unified portrait of a conflicted man and a singular achievement for Hollywood‚Äôs reigning blockbuster auteur.']"
