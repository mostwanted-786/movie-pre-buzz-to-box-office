Love by Drowning,ERROR
Mickey and the Bear,"""Mickey and the Bear"" unfolds languidly, allowing tension to build slowly, intimately."
Mickey and the Bear,"Every shot in ""Mickey and the Bear"" is scrupulously judged but never overworked or fussy, resulting in a movie that is as artful as it is unforced."
Mickey and the Bear,"Even at its most dire, Mickey and the Bear is tinged with an almost holy hope for all involved, a rare and remarkable feat to pull off so well for a first-time director indeed."
Mickey and the Bear,"Through these complicated dynamics, Morrone navigates her character's many highs and lows with a touching sense of authenticity."
Mickey and the Bear,The best thing one can say about Attanasio's approach to this material... is that she understands how complicated people's lives are when on the surface their issues might seem cut-and-dried.
Mickey and the Bear,Small but deeply felt.
Mickey and the Bear,"An almost perfectly realized drama that feels as if it was time-warped in from 40 or 50 years ago, when people still wanted to see movies about people living in the actual world."
Mickey and the Bear,"[A] sturdy, watchable character drama..."
Mickey and the Bear,"Mickey and the Bear explores failed ambition, familial guilt, and adolescent rebellion, and its precise execution ensures this story is one of female resilience and self-will."
Mickey and the Bear,There's undeniable emotional resonance in Annabelle Attanasio's Mickey and the Bear.
Mickey and the Bear,An assured debut that heralds a sensitive and dynamic filmmaking talent.
Mickey and the Bear,"""Mickey and the Bear"" reps an assured feature debut for Annabelle Attanasio, who wrote and directed this straightforward but skillfully nuanced drama about a troubled father-daughter relationship."
Hustlers,Hustlers is a triumph.
Hustlers,It's easy to get lost in the visceral joy that comes with watching women move this way.
Hustlers,"A heist thriller-cross-social drama, Hustlers' weight is wrapped in the veneer of diamantés and stilettos, but there is real substance here."
Hustlers,...the script and plot are dull and obvious. The attempted humour is anything but funny.
Hustlers,"The hard-boiled exchanges between the women have a genuine exuberance, recalling Hollywood movies of the 1930s where showgirls trade wisecracks backstage."
Hustlers,"As good as Lopez and her onscreen accomplice Constance Wu are, they can't act what isn't in the script; other than a dedicated work ethic, we're never given access to their thoughts."
Hustlers,"Through the peephole of Lorene Scafaria's camera, a world pirouetting on and catering to the male gratification becomes a joyous playground for women's empowerment."
Hustlers,So here come words we weren't necessarily expecting to write : give Jennifer Lopez the freaking Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress right now.
Hustlers,"With a refreshingly dynamic soundtrack and impressive costume design, it's fair to say that almost everything about the film works as intended"
Hustlers,"[It] understands its characters, understands its world...it's fun, and I thought Jennifer Lopez was very, very good."
Hustlers,Hustlers recreates the riveting crime story for a semisweet feel-good movie that's entertaining from start to finish.
Hustlers,"Hustlers is arguably the finest performance Jennifer Lopez has ever given, and there is no way for me to be unbiased about that fact. Her performance is as magnetic as it is layered, loving and warm as it is fearsome and dangerous."
Hustlers,"Constance Wu, Mette Towley, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart and a cameo by ex-stripper Cardi B add magic as the women go from self-help, to self-employment, to self-infliction."
Hustlers,Jennifer Lopez [is] just absolutely astounding in every single way.
Hustlers,"Lopez is captivating with all the right moves, and there's not a bad performance in the house, albeit most feel smaller."
Hustlers,J-Lo is the only reason to see it.
Hustlers,"It's meant as a compliment when strong females are called ballsy, but it would be truer to say that J-Lo's extraordinary creation is vagina-y."
Hustlers,"Hustlers is a classically made film about capital - sexual, social and financial."
Hustlers,"A lean, fierce take on the nature of female empowerment in an inherently corrupted world."
Hustlers,"This is a deeply feminist film, one where men are given less screen time than the cameoing Cardi B and Lizzo."
Hustlers,"An immediate entrant into the pantheon of female friendship movies, Hustlers-a pretty much perfect film-makes plain the hollowness of so many other iterations of girl power in studio projects. You can feel its heart beat."
Hustlers,"Hustlers is the mashup of Showgirls, Goodfellas, and The Big Short that we never knew we needed."
Hustlers,"Scafaria's film is always a blast to watch, resulting in a surprising level of emotional depth."
Hustlers,"The film is at its best when it's about the bond between the women, but it's a theme that doesn't hit home until far too late."
Hustlers,"Hustlers is a Goodfellas-style caper. But here, the fellas are easy marks. It's the women who - to quote cast member Cardi B - make the money moves. The satisfaction is undeniable."
Hustlers,"Scafaria is their champion, and her movie is their celebration, and I can't wait for audiences all over the world to get the chance to see that for themselves."
Hustlers,"At heart Hustlers is a bit retro, both a callback to the ditzy gold-diggers of the 1930s and a high-energy, montage-heavy crime caper in the Scorsese vein, as these likeable good-gals turn the tables on Wall Street's most lascivious wolves."
Hustlers,"""Hustlers"" doesn't dig as deep into the particulars of its maneuvering as it could, but it leaves its mark as a forceful piece of girl power. Don't hate the players when the game's this much fun."
Hustlers,"Yet, while it's superficially entertaining, this true-life tale of the lap dancers who drugged their clients and maxed out their credit cards is, like visiting a strip club, ultimately a bit depressing."
Hustlers,"The focus here is on the characters and their relationships, doing their best to take care of their families, both the ones by birth and the ones by choice."
Hustlers,"Hustlers has everything going for it. It's brimming with energy, respects its characters and makes you think. If you're looking for a great time at the theater that also boasts artistry and heart, Hustlers is undoubtedly one of the best options of 2019."
Hustlers,"Bawdy, lusty and in your face..."
Hustlers,"There's something delicious about the way Hustlers delivers on its promise of glitz, sex, and raunchiness while delving far enough beneath the surface to subvert the genre."
Hustlers,Hustlers asks what a movie like Goodfellas looks like with women at the center of the story.
Hustlers,"The figurative runaway limo these women are riding in is headed for a crash. But oh, the ride is glorious!"
Hustlers,"Jennifer Lopez does her best work in years, but it's Constance Wu who anchors the story with a grounded and natural performance."
Hustlers,"Hustlers, it must be said, is hustle incarnate."
Hustlers,"It's a full-fledged epic, made by and about women, and proof positive that female-centered films can flourish without being based on a pre-existing male-based IP."
Hustlers,Don't miss Hustlers. It's not only a dazzling crowd-pleaser but also one of the best films of the year hands-down.
Hustlers,"This is girlie ""Goodfellas,"" and it's an energizing instant crime classic, a shot of adrenaline cloaked in cocoa butter."
Hustlers,"Although the film is filled with strong female characters, this isn't a triumph of female empowerment, nor is it really a feminist film. It is a film of anger and sadness at the stacked decks of our social and economic structures."
Hustlers,"A solid caper movie rooted in the challenges associated with running any criminal enterprise -- a more modest version of Goodfellas, with less blood, and more skin."
Hustlers,"You root for them and for the film, which is over too quickly; you just want to hang with these women a little longer."
Hustlers,The film is remarkable for capturing a brewing conflict between women while also celebrating their connection.
Hustlers,"...a heartwarming tale of friendship, family, and shopping. Cardi B and Lizzo are brilliant in all too brief dramatic roles."
Hustlers,"When all the pieces of Hustlers come together, you're left realizing just how full an experience this film is."
Hustlers,I wish the movie had a little more of a mature exploration of what these women were feeling inside while doing these things.
Hustlers,"Lopez and company remind us there's more than one kind of story worth telling about money, sex, women and, as Burt Lancaster put it in another New York story, ""Sweet Smell of Success,"" the greedy murmur of little men."
Hustlers,"Much of the script crackles in its portrayal of both larceny and female friendship, but it frequently leaves out what seems like essential connective tissue."
Hustlers,"Hustlers is brash, often crude and unabashedly chaotic, but it is its ""buddy movie"" sensibility which ultimately wins the day. A robustly made, beautifully acted and decidedly engaging story about some unlikely heroines."
Hustlers,"Consisting of the scrappy storytelling qualities of an indie film yet having the crowd-pleasing mentality of blockbusters, Hustlers will hopefully pave the way for investment in these types of narratives."
Hustlers,"It plays like a camp version of Steve McQueen's Widows mixed with Showgirls and Lopez is unforgettable as the mink-clad strip-club diva purring: ""Climb in my fur."""
Hustlers,"A lush, lavish joy that's difficult to forget."
Hustlers,"A Best Actress Oscar nomination for Jennifer Lopez? You better believe it. As a stripper who can work a pole better than rivals half her age, Lopez is that dazzling, that deep, that electrifying. This you don't want to miss."
Hustlers,Director Lorene Scafaria evidently thought that low-grade sex and crime could be done as high-class Sturm und Drang. It can't. Unless you're Martin Scorsese in a purple streak.
Hustlers,"If you want to see JLo in her best role in 21 years, since she dallied with George Clooney in Out of Sight, you've come to the right naughty place."
Hustlers,"The movie seems to view any examination of its characters' motives, their working conditions or the consequences of their actions as a kind of betrayal."
Hustlers,"A high-heeled crime caper with rollicking energy and an emotional left hook. Think ""Goodfellas"" in glitter."
Hustlers,"In this raunchy, gloriously liberated revenge fantasy, Lopez rules with seductive, triumphant authority. Not only do we climb into her fur, we'll happily follow her anywhere."
Hustlers,"A giddily entertaining homage to female power that illuminates bold ambition in its stars and director alike, Hustlers is the kind of era-defining film that Hollywood didn't know it needed."
Hustlers,"Without treading into over-sentimentality or, worse, hollow signalling to the most well-trod tropes of female friendship on screen, Hustlers takes a more organic view of the mercurial intimacies between its lead women."
Hustlers,"Captivating, hilarious and intriguing, Hustlers is an enticing display of sisterhood, feminism, and tenacity."
Hustlers,A thrilling story filtered through the female gaze - and all the more commanding for it.
Hustlers,"[The Meddler] was [director Lorene] Scafaria's last effort behind the camera, and while it's a more than worthy showcase for her abundant talent, Hustlers rockets past it with mesmerizing exuberance."
Hustlers,"Lopez gives her most electrifying screen performance since ""Out of Sight,"" slipping the movie into her nonexistent pocket from the moment she strides out onto a neon-lighted stage in a rhinestone bodysuit."
Hustlers,Breaking the rules has never seemed so fun . . . or so necessary.
Hustlers,"Beneath all the chinchilla and body glitter, there's a smart, beating heart."
Hustlers,"It's also funny, empowering, sexy, emotional, and a bit scary, with most of those superlatives coming care of a full-force performance from Jennifer Lopez genuinely deserving of awards consideration."
Hustlers,"There is nobody to root for here, an issue that leads to checking one's watch midway through the show."
Hustlers,"An enjoyable, empowering extravaganza of physical humor, clever scriptwriting, exquisite fashion and scantily clad underdogs."
Hustlers,"""Hustlers"" humanizes the women at its center, giving them boyfriends, backstories and, most importantly, agency."
Hustlers,"Blessed with one of the most memorable entrances in recent cinema history, Lopez slinks through Hustlers with a deceptive ease, as in control of the film as her character is of her situation."
Hustlers,Scafaria validates her heroines from the start by focusing on them as women whose internal struggles and friendships with each other are far more interesting than their obvious physical allure.
Oppenheimer,"What he [Nolan] has put before our eyes definitively deserves to be seen, as does Cillian Murphy's performance in the role of Oppenheimer and the irreconcilable but fantastic Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Lewis Strauss. [Full review in Spanish]"
Oppenheimer,"This is a complex look at a complicated man, but Oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling -- and that Nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it."
Oppenheimer,"Every scene feels like a cataclysm waiting to happen, fitting for a film that builds, step-by-step, to the creation of a cataclysm machine. Oppenheimer both summons awe for what it took to build the bomb and for the changes it wrought."
Oppenheimer,"As he corrals the world’s scientists to follow behind him Robert Oppenheimer is magnetic, more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat."
Oppenheimer,"[Nolan] captures that theoretical aspect of Oppenheimer on the screen in very personal moments... that energy, that swirl of passion in the unknown it's all there, and it is phenomenal to watch."
Oppenheimer,"Christopher Nolan’s newest film is jarring and memorable, an ode to creation and consequence."
Oppenheimer,"Everything about Christopher Nolan’s latest movie is massive. The level of shock and awe is breathtaking, but it can also be taxing."
Oppenheimer,"Befitting his paradigm-shattering protagonist, Nolan so audaciously merges form and content that he completely upends the ‘great-man’ biopic."
Oppenheimer,"Starring Cillian Murphy, and his cheekbones, the film is dense, ambitious, complex, so very long (three hours) and impressive, even if it does drag by the end."
Oppenheimer,"Thanks to Nolan and Murphy, we see the full Oppenheimer -- neither monster nor savior, victim nor villain, but in the end, just a man."
Oppenheimer,"This is a very heady, brainy spectacle. A thesis. A portrait of a genius, his triumphs and shame."
Oppenheimer,The movie is as sluggish as if Nolan were underlining the script’s most salient passages onscreen...
Oppenheimer,"This is a film with intelligence, purpose and historic value."
Oppenheimer,"It’s a movie like no other, dragging us into the collective guilt of history."
Oppenheimer,"For the most part, the film is a towering achievement."
Oppenheimer,"... scientific and historical accuracy are key. Fortunately for fans of both, ""Oppenheimer"" delivers in telling the truth about the story of the Manhattan Project, at least as much as can be expected of a Hollywood blockbuster."
Oppenheimer,"Nolan’s Oppenheimer barely qualifies as a biopic... Instead it’s a movie investigating the nature of power: how it is created, how it is kept in balance, and how it leads people into murky quandaries that refuse simplistic answers."
Oppenheimer,Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster captures the scientific triumphs and monstrous sins of the Manhattan Project.
Oppenheimer,"Not since The Master, perhaps, has a filmmaker used the large gauge to such intimate effect, making a vast canvas from one man’s troubled features."
Oppenheimer,"Nolan discards the dates and details of traditional biopic storytelling, which is a frustrating if evocative choice. He thrusts us headlong and simultaneously into the advent and fallout of the nuclear arms race with [a] nagging insistence"
Oppenheimer,"A story of ordinary men and women caught up in extraordinary times. What they created really did “change the world,” but no one here rises to the level of hero, or even tragic hero, and even the villainy on display is more vanity than anything else."
Oppenheimer,"Perhaps in trimming the story to three hours, some of the male-female narrative connective tissue was cut, which may be why, for all its fascinating moving parts, the busy biopic isn’t more emotionally explosive."
Oppenheimer,"Perhaps inevitably, it falls short of its ambitions. But it’s bracing to see a studio movie these days, particularly one with such huge scope, that at least attempts to serve up more than recycled goods."
Oppenheimer,Nolan's time-hopping structure works brilliantly in a film about men who compartmentalize their jobs as well as their being - separating ambition from morality - to propel science forward and set humanity back. Last act fumbles a jerry-rigged catharsis.
Oppenheimer,"Nolan has set out to make a moral epic, and he succeeds for the most part, or, rather, for the first two thirds of “Oppenheimer,” which contains some of the finest, most galvanizing moviemaking of his career."
Oppenheimer,"Nolan’s film... is one I couldn’t help but admire, even if, like the observers of the Trinity test, I could observe it only from a distance, at once awed and ambivalent."
Oppenheimer,"Christopher Nolan deserves every superlative for his take on J. Robert Oppenheimer (a flawless Cillian Murphy), the dark knight of the atomic age. This terrifying, transfixing epic emerges as a monumental achievement on the march into screen history."
Oppenheimer,"Nolan has crafted something so exhilarating that its more maddening aspects can’t help but stick out like a sore thumb, and I’ll be curious to discover if my opinion of the finished product improves or diminishes on a second watch."
Oppenheimer,"Mr. Nolan’s utterly enthralling film lasts three hours. But despite being as talky as a math seminar, it crackles, hurtles and whooshes, generating more suspense and excitement than anything found in the alleged climaxes of the recent superhero pictures."
Oppenheimer,"Nolan's film illuminates not only the intellectual life and complicated legacy of one of America’s most consequential scientific minds but also the array of opposing, divided systems that drove his ambition and determined his actions."
Oppenheimer,"Nolan isn't interested in scaling down or tidying up. Heck, no one expects a bomb to go off cleanly, and there's plenty to sift through in ""Oppenheimer's"" shrapnel. People will likely be going through it for years."
Oppenheimer,"With its everyone-and-the-kitchen-sink casting, alternating between color and black and white, fit-for-Imax spectacle and Ludwig Göransson’s pounding musical score, Oppenheimer seeks to overwhelm the audience, an approach that works to an extent."
Oppenheimer,"At three hours, it is too long -- as, sigh, all films are these days -- but compared with the dimension-bending twists and trickery of the films that made Nolan a superstar director, Oppenheimer feels classier, more serious."
Oppenheimer,If Hollywood is ending as we know it – and all signs on that question point to a strong “maybe” – then Oppenheimer is the ideal movie to finish us all.
Oppenheimer,"Despite being overlong and unevenly paced, Oppenheimer contains moments of greatness and features one of the most compelling lead performances (by Cillian Murphy) in recent memory."
Oppenheimer,"The movie is so vigorously directed, not only in terms of sight but also sound, that probably the best a critic can do is point you toward the experience and say, “It’s that.”"
Oppenheimer,"However you choose to view “Oppenheimer,” it’s the picture of a man who reaped everything he sowed."
Oppenheimer,What I can say for sure is that “Oppenheimer” far too often feels like a three-hour Wikipedia entry than a compelling movie.
Oppenheimer,"Though they may seem disparate, the many elements of Oppenheimer refract and reflect each other, like a bunch of atoms creating a chain reaction or a group of scientists building off each other's ideas to forge something new."
Oppenheimer,"Either despite its intense craft or because of it, Oppenheimer works."
Oppenheimer,"For all we learn about the creation and execution of the atomic bomb and its aftermath, the story could and should be told in a more digestible form. Instead, we have an overlong narrative that isn’t revelatory or surprising."
Oppenheimer,"Elevated by Cillian Murphy’s exacting performance, Nolan’s biopic on the father of the atomic bomb is majestic and morally complex."
Oppenheimer,"This is dense material that’s thoroughly engrossing and by its end, shattering."
Oppenheimer,"Murphy’s eerily handsome face, made up of angles and shadows and eyes that always seem to be telling a story that’s different from the one he’s speaking, is the film’s foundation, and his layered performance is its anchor."
Oppenheimer,"It’s Christopher Nolan’s best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain."
Oppenheimer,"It’s more impressive for how the director has made such a personal narrative feel epic, not just in visual breadth but in dramatic sweep, presenting a story from the past that feels knotted to so many present anxieties about nuclear annihilation."
Oppenheimer,"As a physical experience, ""Oppenheimer"" is something else entirely—it's hard to say exactly what, and that's what's so fascinating about it."
Oppenheimer,My patience wore thin as the director gave into one of his favorite indulgences: a bleeding soundscape.
Oppenheimer,Nolan's best film to date and a spectacular achievement for cinema.
Oppenheimer,"Oppenheimer is like atomic physics: Each tiny spark interlocks to create a massive, breathtaking, terrifying, conflagration."
Oppenheimer,"Christopher Nolan has done it again. He’s taken a historical story we know a bit about and turned it into an edge-of-the-seat, heart-in-the-mouth drama."
Oppenheimer,"This is a film about terrible risks and a planet likely destined to destroy itself someday. And we see it, and feel it."
Oppenheimer,The simultaneously old-school and new-school gorgeousness of Oppenheimer can’t be overstressed.
Oppenheimer,"[An] often laborious yet genuinely strange and gripping movie -- a grand spectacle inspired by some of the grimmest events in human history, and itself an invention meant to blow us all away."
Oppenheimer,"Its best moments stand out as some of the most original and exciting filmmaking of the year, highs that do a lot to counterbalance the sequences which dive back into bureaucracy and comparatively petty rivalries."
Oppenheimer,"Downey is the crucial supporting player, and he gives a shrewd, dynamic performance as the wily, insecure, powerful Strauss."
Oppenheimer,"Nolan taps the full sensory potential of moviemaking, pushing picture and sound to meet the scale of the story: clever lines dot the script; the whole project is admirably willing to wrestle with matters of great weight through cinema."
Oppenheimer,"“Oppenheimer” is a great achievement in formal and conceptual terms, and fully absorbing, but Nolan’s filmmaking is, crucially, in service to the history that it relates."
Oppenheimer,"[Nolan] has brought to life not just J. Robert Oppenheimer, but the still-crucial arguments he both started and tried to end. Oppenheimer boldly posits that those arguments are still worth having, in a film of magnitude, profundity and dazzling artistry."
Oppenheimer,"Nolan demonstrates his usual prowess for impeccable visuals and stunning craftsmanship within a deeply despairing portrait of an arrogant genius who, too late, realised the impact of his monstrous creation."
Oppenheimer,"Oppenheimer is a movie with power, texture and grace. By the end, we begin to understand its subject, even if we remain baffled by a genius who somehow divorced himself from the damage his theoretical project would do."
Oppenheimer,The movie around Murphy is simultaneously breathtaking and mind-melding.
Oppenheimer,"Simultaneously a biography, a mystery, a polemic, and a dense character study, Oppenheimer feels like the film Christopher Nolan has been preparing to make his entire career, and it may very well be his best work."
Oppenheimer,"That rare summer movie with ideas as big as its ambition and budget...But ""Oppenheimer"" isn't a movie that is dependent on special effects for its power. In a film aimed squarely at adults, Nolan keeps the focus as much on the man as the magic."
Oppenheimer,"One of the many satisfactions of Oppenheimer, Nolan’s intellectually thrilling and morally despairing new film, is that it succeeds in locating some of those conventions within another of his ingeniously constructed narrative labyrinths."
Oppenheimer,Only Nolan could make this potentially forbidding subject matter so thrilling.
Oppenheimer,"Any filmmaker can create a cinematic universe. (Many have. Too many, some might say.) Very few can show you how a genius perceives the building blocks of our universe, right before that same person imagines something that threatens our existence in it."
Oppenheimer,"The acting is uniformly brilliant, with Murphy, Downey and Blunt simply astounding."
Oppenheimer,"The filmmaker’s technique generally counterpoints any caveats and script imperfections. The ensemble cast is starry and strong. ... “Brilliance makes up for a lot,” Murphy’s Oppenheimer tells us. It sure does."
Oppenheimer,"Magnificent. Christopher Nolan’s three-hour historical biopic Oppenheimer is a gorgeously photographed, brilliantly acted, masterfully edited and thoroughly engrossing epic that instantly takes its place among the finest films of this decade."
Oppenheimer,"A juggernaut historical biopic that you'll want to see again asap, even if it doesn’t all work on the first sweep."
Oppenheimer,"It’s at once a speeding roller-coaster and a skin-tingling spiritual portrait; an often classically minded period piece that only Nolan could have made, and only now, after a quarter-century’s run-up."
Oppenheimer,"Large swathes of the film play out as political thriller, the fuel in its engine being Downey Jr’s titanic colouring of Strauss, all boorishness and manipulative charm."
Oppenheimer,Oppenheimer joins the ranks of Christopher Nolan’s best work not for preserving some essential inexplicability of nuclear physics but by undermining the idea of science’s objectivity.
Oppenheimer,"A masterfully constructed character study from a great director operating on a whole new level. A film that you don’t merely watch, but must reckon with."
Oppenheimer,"Cillian Murphy turns in a haunting career-best performance as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Robert Downey Jr. astounds in a way we haven’t seen in quite some time."
Oppenheimer,"Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty that quakes with the disquieting tremors of a forever rupture in the course of human history."
Oppenheimer,"Like its protagonist, Oppenheimer is a work in constant conflict with itself, with most of its problems rooted in Nolan’s screenplay."
Oppenheimer,Oppenheimer is a movie that makes you say “Oh my God” over and over again -- in awe and in terror.
Oppenheimer,Oppenheimer is a tour de force. An unmatched director at the top of his game throwing off the shackles of science fiction and superheroes to tell the raw story of one man’s transformation into something both more and less than a human being.
Oppenheimer,"Cillian Murphy, with a thousand-yard beam, the half-smile of an intellectual rake, and a way of keeping everything close to the vest, gives a phenomenal performance as Oppenheimer, making him fascinating and multi-layered."
Oppenheimer,"Its scope comes from Murphy’s haunted performance, and the way that the movie (with help from Ludwig Göransson’s panic attack of a score) submerges you in the mindset of its protagonist as though it can create a psychic connection to the past."
Oppenheimer,"Oppenheimer is a mainstream offering of uncommon resonance, sending the viewer out of the theater head-spun and itchy-eyed, ears ringing from all its sophisticated, voluble explosion."
Oppenheimer,Intelligent non-IP-driven filmmaking on a scale we simply don’t see in movie theaters anymore.
Oppenheimer,"This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan."
Oppenheimer,"This is a big, ballsy, serious-minded cinematic event of a type now virtually extinct from the studios. It fully embraces the contradictions of an intellectual giant who was also a deeply flawed man."
Oppenheimer,The most breathtaking film of the year.
Oppenheimer,"“Oppenheimer” offers an indelible portrait of the age when people began wielding power they couldn’t necessarily control, and few movies have so disturbingly crystallized the horror of opening Pandora’s box."
Oppenheimer,"A divided epic of awe and horror, fission and fusion. It’s simultaneously a unified portrait of a conflicted man and a singular achievement for Hollywood’s reigning blockbuster auteur."
Another Round,The last shot of this film [is] as indelible as any you'll find...
Another Round,"The film is well directed. It is well acted. Mikkelsen is always as compelling as his cheekbones. But it's so muddled in its thinking -- alcohol is good; no, it's bad... but good -- that it ends up with nothing of value to say."
Another Round,"It's about a lack of you-ness, forgetting who you are. There's emotional charge to that ending..."
Another Round,"Alcohol is a dangerous pal, the film seems to be saying, but that does not mean it can't still be a pal. For some. Under certain conditions."
Another Round,"A heady, vibrant, funny film about Danish drinking culture and middle-aged angst. But it also speaks to the great personal pain that lies hidden within its frames."
Another Round,"Another Round is made irresistible by Mikkelsen: such a noble face, such a wonderful presence even when most withdrawn, battered and saddened."
Another Round,"If it says nothing new about the dangers of over-indulgence, Another Round is funny and rich, a fresh, perfectly played, clear-eyed take on middle age ennui. Intoxicating."
Another Round,"Another Round has the lurching rhythm of a drinking session. All is great fun, or at least loudly harmless, right up the point when it isn't."
Another Round,So much more than a gaudy comedy - a warning to hold onto what you love in life with all your might.
Another Round,"Another Round is a very entertaining film. It's energetic, attentively shot and exceedingly well acted - which is impressive because it's so easy to overdo playing drunk."
Another Round,"Even here, as a character with no discernible personality, Mikkelsen casts a sympathetic, believable shadow. His Martin is a nowhere man of great distinction, stuck in a nowheresville of a movie."
Another Round,A peak-form Mads Mikkelsen stars in this hilarious and heartbreaking spellbinder as a Copenhagen high-school teacher who thinks day drinking might sharpen his faculties. The Oscar for Best International Feature belongs right here.
Another Round,Thomas Vinterberg is incredibly astute when it comes to how humans behave in extraordinary circumstances.
Another Round,Audaciously provocative and wickedly funny...
Another Round,"More than anything, Vinterberg's film is a coming-of-age fable in reverse, defined in equal measures by merriment and melancholy. And when these potent elements are mixed correctly, the effect is intoxicating."
Another Round,"I found it unsatisfying on a great many levels, despite the excellent performances of the four actors who play the teachers."
Another Round,"There's a louche '70s swagger to the film, as it follows this tightening band of brothers' increasingly erratic behaviour non-judgementally. The tragicomic tracing of male fragility is fascinating."
Another Round,"Smart and unflinching, Another Round is classic Vinterberg, and reminds us why Mikkelson has become such a hot property not just in Denmark, but internationally."
Another Round,"There is some quiet comedy about all this, but the film never breaks into the open plains of mirth. That's because it has a deep and rich lode of melancholy to mine."
Another Round,"The film features its share of trauma and tragedy, and the final sequence is bittersweet, but it's also one of the most purely entertaining, magnificent moments on film in 2020."
Another Round,"Another Roundis a breath of fresh air for anyone who has been starving for intelligent entertainment. It's invigorating and completely credible, thanks to Vinterberg's approach and the performances of his leading actors"
Another Round,"Another Round is a truly wonderful movie about trying to come to grips with life, anchored by terrific performances, infectious music, and a real understanding of the humming discontentment that all adults must learn to navigate in their own ways."
Another Round,Mikkelsen is magnificent.
Another Round,One of the director's most absorbing works.
Another Round,"The problem is not the substance, it's the person, and with Another Round, Vinterberg has crafted a beautiful dissection of that conundrum."
Another Round,"The Danish writer-director puts the topic on the table in disarming fashion but, in the end, literally dances away from it to reaffirm the status quo without significantly illuminating the issue as seemingly promised at the outset."
Another Round,An intoxicated tale of midlife angst and catharsis and better living through Aquavit.
Another Round,Mikkelsen elevates what could have been another traditional message movie about living life to the fullest even after you think you've had your final drink.
Another Round,"A stinging, gorgeously filmed tragicomedy about male insecurity and the power of positive drinking, it's the latest from the Danish provocateur Thomas Vinterberg..."
Another Round,[Vintergerg] made the rare movie about getting shitfaced that's somehow neither a wallow in the gutter nor a fantasy of life without hangovers.
Another Round,"The filmmaking, for all its tipsiness, retains a striking lucidity..."
Another Round,"Drink, drinking or binge-drinking -- there's some of that too -- can't begin to convey the wild beauty and emotional depth of this film."
Another Round,"""Another Round"" is carefully and delicately wrought, the humor authentic and incidental, rippling with pathos and longing, carefully walking the line between drunken fun and the dark threat of alcoholism that looms."
Another Round,"Vinterberg's delicate, grounded direction and the actors' wonderfully loose performances insist upon authenticity, creating a tonal mishmash that's endearingly absurd."
Another Round,"Even if it springs few genuine revelations, this loping sine wave of a film still lands as an honest take on the high highs and low lows of a sodden Scandinavian lifestyle."
Another Round,"Pop some champagne, crack open the whisky and guzzle back that ice-cold beer. The feelgood film of this or any festival has arrived, and it's a boozy-woozy marvel."
Another Round,"Not many directors can pull off what Vinterberg does here, and with any other creator the conceit would probably devolve into an absurdly daft Adam Sandler comedy."
Another Round,"Another Round will prove to be a fruitful watch for those who are fans of the director's anxious social experiments; however, those who find his work to be a study in self-indulgent intellectualism should stay away."
Another Round,A very pleasurable and sinful experience that could easily be made into an American movie à la The Hangover.
Another Round,"Larsen, Ranthe, and Millang are all terrific - acting drunk in a convincing way is no small feat, especially as they go through varying degrees of intoxication - but the film is ultimately Mikkelsen's show."
Another Round,"Another Round is a film of more quiet desperation and a more thoughtful morality, and it goes down with a kick."
Another Round,"Thomas Vinterberg's latest, like The Hunt, is ultimately a parable about breaking a social contract."
Another Round,"The movie turns out to be a frustrating and rather muddled experience, a ""socially relevant"" trifle that keeps undercutting itself."
Another Round,"A slightly flippant tragicomedy of booze and midlife defiance, based on a pseudoscientific theory which put me in mind of Humphrey Bogart's bleary dictum about the rest of the world being three drinks behind."
Another Round,There's a fundamental thrill to watching Vinterberg and Mikkelsen find their groove again.
Another Round,"It's not just Mikkelsen in the lead, but three supporting actors including Festen's Thomas Bo Larsen who give the film its can't-look-away dynamic."
Another Round,"It makes for an appealing ensemble piece overall, as well as a great vehicle for Mikkelsen's vulpine beauty and nimble dance moves."
Spiral Farm,"Not much happens in ""Spiral Farm,"" but what does is often heartbreaking."
Evergreen,"A sweet, simple journey, taking the scenic route through a young couple's brief-but-meaningful romance."
Little Joe,The first English-language film by Austrian filmmaker Jessica Hausner Little Joe is as slick and as intelligent as anything she has made previously.
Little Joe,"This agonisingly slow pseudo sci-fi has camera moves, performances and lines of dialogue that. Seem. To. Take. An. Eternity. To. Deliver. Without. Much. Impact. Or. Dramatic. Pay Off."
Little Joe,It's a little film. But it's epic.
Little Joe,"For some, Little Joe may seem too sterile to engage emotionally, but I found it glassily unsettling - even more so on second viewing. Inhale at your peril."
Little Joe,Hausner and co-writer Géraldine Bajard present a nightmare in pastel colours in this breathtaking modern sci-fi.
Little Joe,"By eschewing fast-paced suspense Hausner takes the sting out of her story, instead showcasing a bold aesthetic sense that feels like an exciting taste of what's to come."
Little Joe,"A unique, stimulating examination of our quick-fix, happiness-hungry culture."
Little Joe,"Only occasionally will the director permit us the partial release of an old-fashioned shock. When violence does break out, she finds a way to stage it so that we feel the punch, as it were, without actually seeing it."
Little Joe,"A weirder, subtler film than its surface suggests."
Little Joe,What more can you ask from a film about a mind-controlling flower?
Little Joe,"Hausner aims to convince us that the open-endedness at stake is a productive one, but it's difficult to shake the feeling of having been deceived and manipulated by Little Joe when the closing credits roll."
Little Joe,"Just as the formal and technical aspects of Little Joe ensure its consistent mystery and surprise, so too does the film's genre fluidity guarantee that no one theme is overinvested with meaning."
Little Joe,"What if you bred a plant with the power to make people ""happy"" - and its zombified fans would kill to protect it? You'd have Jessica Hausner's mindbending 'Little Joe'-a 'Body Snatchers' for the age of antidepressants."
Little Joe,"It feels a little too muted to be truly frightening or creepy... But the aesthetic is interesting. I was disappointed, but not uninterested."
Little Joe,The film never fulfills the promise of its stylish weirdness.
Little Joe,Effectively creepy...
Little Joe,Writer/director Jessica Hausner has created a striking piece of work.
Little Joe,"""Little Joe"" manages to exert a peculiar pull in spite of being constructed with material you've likely seen elsewhere."
Little Joe,"It's one thing for a movie to be quiet in its approach. It's quite another for it to have ideas that really deserve less than a murmur, that never scale the heights of mild interest on the way to drama."
Little Joe,A delightfully oddball and dread-filled psycho-bio thriller.
Little Joe,"""Little Joe"" is a tale of exquisite refinement, not heavy-handed horror, always walking that thin line between implication and doubt."
Little Joe,"Jessica Hausner confidently expresses a thorny and disturbing theme, though perhaps with too much confidence."
Little Joe,"A deliberately clinical, even cold film about the horror of synthetic happiness, Little Joe is an impressively stylish film that puts the demands of idealized happiness under the microscope in uncomfortable, disturbing ways."
Little Joe,It gets under your skin and lays eggs there. A standout oddity.
Little Joe,"It's tricky, beguiling stuff, rendered with an eerie sterilized beauty."
Little Joe,"[Emily] Beecham is terrific, switching between conviction and doubt with frightening ease, and Ben Whishaw is well cast against his usual sweet type."
Little Joe,"In lesser hands, Little Joe would be a very dangerous film. As it stands, the latest masterful psychodrama from Austrian powerhouse Jessica Hausner still has plenty of potential to offend."
Little Joe,"Slow acting, mannered sets and stylized filming make this film itself sadly affectless."
Little Joe,"Something about Hausner's picture held me, with its narcotic pacing, its smiling, zombified performances and its intensely, almost radioactively bright digital sheen."
Little Joe,"Creepy for how mundanely uncreepy it plays its scenario, Little Joe is an existential horror movie about our inability to understand our own complicated emotions, and the allure of relenting to a kind of thoughtless, unburdened happiness."
Little Joe,It's impressive how Hausner manages to splice together all these distinctive elements so harmoniously.
Little Joe,"Pre-screening buzz suggested the film plays like a supersize Black Mirror episode, and that's not far off."
Little Joe,"None of this is represented in any compelling dramatic style, and the actors - all very talented and assured - have perhaps not had clear enough direction. It is a mood piece. Whose mood leads nowhere."
Little Joe,Hausner's too smart and too playful not to tickle you with what she's attempting.
Little Joe,"For those who engage with it, this oddly off-kilter piece of storytelling should exert a pull every bit as mesmerising as any genetically modified mood-enhancing shrub."
Little Joe,"A lifeless, tone-deaf variation on Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Little Joe rots on its own vine."
Little Joe,"Hausner works in a shivery and deliberate modernist spook-show style, one that calls up echoes of early David Cronenberg and the Stanley Kubrick of ""The Shining."""
The Painted Bird,Few films are this tough to sit through-or difficult to forget.
The Painted Bird,"For all its overworked grotesqueries, it attempts an intriguing climb from the deepest pits of horror towards some kind of stoic grace."
The Painted Bird,Deals in visual poetry that compels attention even as it wallows in unkindness.
The Painted Bird,"The sequence of events is so relentlessly brutal as to become numbing, almost comical."
The Painted Bird,"It's much easier, says The Painted Bird, to simply throw our hands in the air and declare humanity doomed."
The Painted Bird,"The Painted Bird is a brutal kind of ordeal, but eerie, unearthly and even beautiful sometimes: a bad dream that leaks into waking reality."
The Painted Bird,"With rare commitment, Marhoul sets himself to portraying such all-consuming human depravity, the only response is to crumple."
The Painted Bird,"While not exploitative and (mostly) not gratuitous, this is as tough as it gets - you bleed for this kid. Even if it gets a bit too much, you just can't look away. Thrilling filmmaking."
The Painted Bird,"There's a style and breadth to some of its imagery that contradict and complicate its ostensible realism in memorable ways... But its methods notwithstanding, The Painted Bird's endgame falls short."
The Painted Bird,"Brutal, the film is. Very powerful, except for slight manipulation."
The Painted Bird,"The effect is cumulative: you see how each successive horror really takes its toll on this kid and changes him. Impressively, it's done with little dialogue on [Peter Kotlár's] part."
The Painted Bird,"The Painted Bird is a potent, visceral but rewarding film for viewers who can withstand the onslaught of traumatizing moments."
The Painted Bird,"I must admit that staying with the film required steady purpose, but the experience, far from being numbing, was spellbinding. By the end there was no distance between me and the boy. I could see him thinking."
The Painted Bird,All of this unvarnished evil is depicted with haunting beauty and uncompromising artistry.
The Painted Bird,Impressive on a number of levels ... most of them technical.
The Painted Bird,"""The Painted Bird"" is a challenging film, impressively and proudly hard to watch. It's also just a little too easy."
The Painted Bird,"The rest of the time it's more like a vulture picking at the carcass of history, and there's only so much meat on those bones."
The Painted Bird,The more likely question will be whether it was necessary for this film to adhere so closely to its source and chronicle a multitude of barbaric acts over its relatively long duration.
The Painted Bird,"Hard to watch and harder to forget, this searing adaptation of Jerzy Kosiński's bestseller by Czech filmmaker Václav Marhoul spares nothing in showing the atrocities witnessed by anabandoned Jewish boy (Petr Kotlár) near the end of WW2."
The Painted Bird,"The film's emotional spectrum, a flat line of unyielding despair, is as limited as its color palette. And it settles into a pattern so dispiritingly repetitive (and repetitively dispiriting) it begins to resemble self-parody..."
The Painted Bird,"While Kosinski's prose renders the grotesque vivid by understatement, this adaptation often seems to have little purpose beyond literal-minded visualization."
The Painted Bird,"And just as the child will never forget what he saw that day, I will never be able to shake The Painted Bird."
The Painted Bird,The Painted Bird is a bloody and bruised slice of life...
The Painted Bird,There isn't a whiff of pretentiousness to be found. Only guts and incredible visuals.
The Painted Bird,Václav Marhoul's film is at its most magnificent when it lingers on the poetry of its images.
The Painted Bird,"[A] harrowing, gorgeous - yes, slightly sadistic - and ultimately deeply moving film."
The Painted Bird,"It's a difficult film; upsetting, cruel, vicious and absolutely harrowing. But it is also probably a masterpiece"
The Painted Bird,It's always starkly compelling as a reminder of why war survival stories are essential to our understanding of innocence and beastliness.
The Painted Bird,"With more restraint this could have been a masterpiece; as it is, it's one only for arthouse connoisseurs with very strong stomachs."
The Painted Bird,I can state without hesitation that this is a monumental piece of work and one I'm deeply glad to have seen. I can also say that I hope to never cross its path again.
The Painted Bird,"It's tough to amply describe the film's relentlessly brutal pleasures, but those who have seen films like Andrei Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood, Robert Bresson's Mouchette or Elem Klimov's Come and See might have an idea of the grim terrain we're on here."
The Painted Bird,"Adapted from Jerzy Kosinski's 1965 novel of the same title, The Painted Bird receives its ideal film treatment in Vaclav Marhoul's heart-wrenching Czech Republic/Ukraine/Slovakia co-production."
The Painted Bird,"""The Painted Bird"" is inarguably effective and immersive, its hard, unyielding gaze backed up by the muscularity of its craft."
Creed III,Creed III comes alive as a result of Jonathan Majors and Michael B. Jordan's emotionally charged performances.
Creed III,"By delivering the expected and doing so with style and intensity, it lands in the top tier of the nine Rocky universe movies, although falling short by a few titles from the pinnacle."
Creed III,"Creed III is too sleek, too rushed, and too contrived to deliver [all] the emotional payoffs it promises."
Creed III,The visuals are full of action and energy.
Creed III,"Solid installment!... Pretty pedestrian, but goes places I really like."
Creed III,"Creed III is promoted as a boxing movie, but is really a tale of pain, regret and the power of brotherhood."
Creed III,Worth the price of a ringside seat.
Creed III,"While Creed III features a well-drawn, menacing adversary in Jonathan Majors’s Dame Anderson, it doesn’t utilize him enough."
Creed III,"Creed III is much more sure-footed in presenting a fascinating emotional struggle for its title character as well as a physical one, even if it ends up diminishing its most subversive plot threads."
Creed III,"There are a couple of decisions that take place in the film in terms of story that get a little hokey... [but] by the time you get to the finally fight, Michael B. Jordan does something really interesting with the fight sequences."
Creed III,"Admirers of this boxing saga, adults craving drama, genre fans looking for a fight and those who enjoy excellent acting will go the rounds with Creed III. Why? Because Jordan doesn’t pull any punches. He lands them."
Creed III,A heavyweight sequel from Michael B. Jordan.
Creed III,"Creed III captures the spectacle and ceremony of boxing, providing the audience with an entertaining thrill ride. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, owing much to its predecessors in the Rocky and Creed series in story structure and character development."
Creed III,"Jordan is doing double duty here, directing as well as starring in this solidly by-numbers chapter in the ongoing Creed saga."
Creed III,"Michael B. Jordan makes a confident and selfless debut as an actor-director, sharing space in his ring with a heavyweight like Majors."
Creed III,Creed III may be the first Rocky movie without an appearance from Sylvester Stallone but it proves that it’s fine to move on from the original icon. It didn’t need him.
Creed III,"It is, admittedly, exciting to watch. Not because it’s Rocky. But because it’s Rocky reborn."
Creed III,Creed III packs one hell of a punch.
Creed III,"The first Rocky came out in 1976 and showed no sign of being the kind of movie that would spawn eight follow-ups. But with the inventiveness of Creed III, an old franchise suddenly feels fresh."
Creed III,"It’s a better one for being about exactly the conflict you think it’s about. This is the chickens coming home to roost, as the saying goes."
Creed III,"Creed III’s greatest achievement is demonstrating that there’s more story to be told about Donny, who after two films had been looking pretty thoroughly explored as a character."
Creed III,"The two Final Fight combatants are fearsome and beautiful to behold, and Jordan does his best to get visually creative, but there’s more drama in the training montage — possibly because it’s the only place where his character feels vincible."
Creed III,"Jordan has long since proven himself as an actor of terrific charisma, versatility, and humanity; with “Creed III,” he shows he’s just as captivating on the other side of the lens."
Creed III,"Still, even with the steady supply of clichés and occasional leaps of logic, the dramatic scenes smoulder away nicely."
Creed III,One of the franchise's more grounded films.
Creed III,"Michael B. Jordan returns as star and now director to play the boxing champ who comes out of retirement to take on a fierce new contender (a dynamite Jonathan Majors). Even when the overcrowded plot stumbles, this clash of the titans is worth cheering."
Creed III,"I'd call the movie a split decision. It falters occasionally but, in the end, ""Creed III"" wins."
Creed III,"A film that, despite being underwritten at crucial points, is better than any third entry in a franchise has a right to be."
Creed III,Sadly all the elements that made the first two films so accessible and engaging are nowhere to be found here.
Creed III,"Majors dominates, prowling through each scene as if he were a sly, observationally carnivorous velociraptor craftily stalking its prey. I couldn’t take my eyes off him."
Creed III,"With his unnervingly nonchalant gaze and jaw jutting forward, Majors radiates hidden, explosive danger, and his formidably brawny physique makes an understatement of Dame’s boast to have kept in shape in prison."
Creed III,There are punches so visceral you’ll feel like you’re in the ring.
Creed III,"Like any good title fight, ""Creed III"" needs a rematch."
Creed III,"What Jordan does best as star, director and producer is showcase Majors’ heavyweight performance, cementing him as one of our brightest stars. Taking over a behind-the-scenes role is a part of the “Rocky” legacy, and Jordan takes the reins with ease"
Creed III,"Although there is nary a mention of Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky Balboa in this one, the indomitable spirit, grit and heart that made the 1976 original a surprise hit is still alive — 47 years later."
Creed III,"Jordan, as director, delivers a captivating blend of explosive energy and melodramatic intensity; he sharpens the stark lines of conflict with keen attention to performance... and a controlled, storm-like feeling of moods building to crises."
Creed III,The Stallone-free debut from Michael B. Jordan bashes life into the boxing movie genre.
Creed III,"We probably didn’t need a third Creed film, but in his directorial debut, the franchise’s star Michael B. Jordan proves more than capable of hitting the right beats and telling a straightforward story without getting distracted by cinematic gimmicks."
Creed III,"The original hero, unlikely heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa, is out of sight and barely referenced... As compensation, this leaves room to appreciate Creed III as a pretty good standalone boxing melodrama, at least for the first two thirds."
Creed III,Quality film that’s better than the bulk of Rocky movies.
Creed III,No movie franchise has lasted so long in such relative good health. Creed III certainly deserves to be seen. And it deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the largest portions of the most unhealthy snacks.
Creed III,The friction between the two gives the film a real sense of grounded emotion and makes the climactic and inevitable final fight a rousing and refreshing respite from the typical formula.
Creed III,"Bulking up the back story slows the pacing, in a movie that finally delivers the goods but whose broader ambitions under director/star Michael B. Jordan get boxed in by its ring-shaped formula."
Creed III,Better than Creed II — and Jonathan Majors keeps the champ on his toes.
Creed III,"Creed III tells a story that takes the best parts of the Rocky franchise and blends them into a sort of rock-’em-sock-’em comfort food, so fighting-form slick it slides down your gullet like a raw-egg smoothie."
Creed III,"Jordan keeps the film clear of head and light on its feet. As Creed III glides and grunts to its close, the series feels anything but spent."
Creed III,"Come for the boxing, yes — but bring plenty of hankies, too."
Creed III,"Some underfed elements keep the film from being a knockout, but this is still a franchise entry to be proud of."
Creed III,Jordan’s directorial debut starts strong but tires out in the final round.
Creed III,"The Creed series continues to be a more interesting examination of class, caste, and American meritocracy than the Rocky films ever were, all within the bounds of crunchy, buttery popcorn cinema."
Creed III,"Michael B. Jordan and Jonathan Majors face off in a boxing story told with style, taste and respect for the audience."
Creed III,"No Rocky, no problem."
Creed III,"Giving the gloves to Michael B. Jordan both in front of and behind the camera leads to satisfying results, and the year of great Jonathan Majors performances continues."
Creed III,"In the end, every theme finds a physical mirror in the ring: the drama of life writ large in left hooks. And nobody gets to retire from that."
Creed III,"“Creed III” works as well as it needs to, and for the umpteenth film in a franchise, that’s more than enough."
Creed III,"A promising debut for [Michael B. Jordan], who shows here that he’ll never let his own star ego get in the way of a film: Majors steals the show, and Jordan is there to capture it."
Creed III,“Creed III” is definitely a people movie. And Jordan has trained his lens on the right subjects.
Creed III,"""Creed III"" is an intensely enjoyable continuation of the Creed story, one that doesn't pack a lot of surprises in its punch but nonetheless goes the distance."
Creed III,"As of this moment, today, Jonathan Majors is a movie star."
Creed III,"As both actor and director, Jordan pulls off some fancy footwork in Creed III."
Creed III,"In his directorial debut, Michael B. Jordan brings a surprisingly heartfelt though formulaic addition to the Rocky franchise."
Creed III,"Whether Rocky fans will take issue with the lack of Stallone or some of the film’s bigger swings, there’s a confidence to respect in this film, as it tells a story which feels fresh within the established framework."
Creed III,"At its best, the movie takes the unlikely shape of a yuppie-in-peril thriller about chickens coming home to roost, Cape Fear reinvented into a Shakespearean sports drama."
Creed III,"But just as a great boxer can’t pull the same trick over and over again, neither can a franchise, an issue previously the cause for the steep drop-off in quality among the nonetheless lucrative “Rocky” sequels."
Creed III,"It’s easy to see the film’s punches coming before they’re thrown, but that doesn’t lessen their wallop when they land."
Creed III,A fascinating film from a new director who seems unafraid of moments of teary defeat that manifest into something far more introspective and self-nourishing — even when that’s between two brawny Black men at odds with each other and themselves.
Creed III,Creed III comes down to a draw between its flashes of brilliance and its missed opportunities.
Creed III,"Can the Rocky franchise exist without Rocky?... Creed III, finally, has actually answered the question at hand. And it’s done so with a firm and enthusiastic “yes”."
Creed III,"An overcooked script... keeps Creed III from landing every punch it throws. Overall, though, it does prove victorious: Jordan clearly has directorial skill, and he and Majors make for a formidable onscreen duo."
Creed III,"Creed III suffers from a certain lack of heft and specificity in its storytelling structure, a sense that the original bare-knuckle magic is not all there. But it's also often better than the blunt-force melodrama of the last film."
Creed III,"If Creed III turns out to be the last Creed movie, it will prove to be a satisfying finale. But if not, it keeps the bar high."
Creed III,Creed III is a thrilling crowning of a new hero grappling with his own complicated legacy.
Creed III,"A rare sequel that comes close to restoring one’s faith in the worth and legitimacy of the franchise as a concept, the latest chapter in what might well be the best we have right now."
Creed III,"Jordan uses the full power of IMAX to direct some glorious fight scenes... These flourishes will surely delight many fans of the franchise, even as the narrative -- the reason we keep watching Adonis fight in and out of the ring -- lets us down."
Creed III,"This film’s ability to introduce new characters, recontextualize old ones, and even play with new genres is satisfying and electric."
Edie,"There are two stunningly beautiful sights in Edie, about an 83-year-old woman who wants to climb a mountain. The first is the breathtaking scenery of the Scottish countryside...the second is the lovely face of actress Sheila Hancock..."
Edie,The growing friendship between Edie and Jonny has an understated but very genuine warmth.
Edie,"Something tells me a documentary on Hancock simply navigating the rigors of ""Edie,"" as well as acting it to the fullest, might have been more readily inspiring."
Edie,"The story in ""Edie"" may get sidetracked from time to time, but Hancock never does, with a focus every bit the equal of her character's, if not more so."
Edie,"Hancock is wasted here, as are the meaty dramatic threads that Elizabeth O'Halloran's formulaic screenplay never bothers to pull."
Edie,"The only thing that does not disappoint is the ravishing and varied landscape, even if it is shot a bit like a tourist board advertisement."
Edie,"Debbie Wiseman's eager and overemotional score sometimes undermines the actors' more quiet work. But the uplifting ""Edie"" is worthy of your time, mostly thanks to Hancock and Scotland's natural beauty."
Edie,"It's a perfectly viable set-up, but the film never explores it in emotionally satisfying fashion."
Edie,"Within its own modest goals, Edie achieves its purpose, to deliver an uncontroversial message..."
Edie,"In common with its difficult protagonist and her hardscrabble holiday, director Simon Hunter's film is pleasingly gritty, even in moments of levity."
Edie,"With its drab, overpowering score, this tedious drama is nearly as gruelling as the trek up Scotland's Suilven..."
Edie,An uplifting character study that's definitely worth a look.
Edie,A committed performance from the redoubtable stage and screen veteran Sheila Hancock drives the final third of this wilderness drama into sublime places.
Edie,"The mere concept of Hancock, as the newly liberated widow of the title, clambering around Scottish mountainsides might be enough to sustain a trailer, but it doesn't go the distance here."
Edie,"I desperately wanted to love Edie, and I did give it every chance, I think, but I just could not love it as I wished."
Edie,This well-meaning film basically retreads the old ideas about the old person who in death's encroaching shadow has one last glorious life-affirming adventure...
Edie,The filmmakers show us both the cost and the rewards for the venerable mountaineer.
Edie,It's by no means perfect but any film that inspires 80-year-olds to climb a mountain - or at least believe they still can - can only be a good thing.
Edie,Fleeting charm and pretty packaging will leave you partially satisfied but later craving a bolder film that puts its battle-worn title character to better use.
Goldie,Heralds the arrival of both a distinctive new filmmaking voice and a leading lady with charisma to burn.
Goldie,"[Slick Woods] has got this really striking presence, which is a lot of what drives this film and how compelling it is."
Goldie,"Throughout, de Jong both romanticizes the unique vigor of New York City (especially the Bronx), and seeps the viewer into its harsh realities as everything grows more impossible for Goldie by the minute."
Goldie,"""Goldie"" is about how in the most dire of situations that click is ever more alluring, and ever more elusive."
Goldie,"Woods, remarkably comfortable in her first film role, gives Goldie a steel spine and a feisty resourcefulness, her moments of vulnerability rare, but essential."
Goldie,Woods detonates an explosion of raging emotions.
Goldie,"There's a unique vision at play, from the very first frame of the film, and I wanted to see it to its end."
Goldie,"Suspension between can-do spirit and come-down reality pumps blood into the irrepressible heart of this scrappy tale, along with the natural charisma of model Slick Woods, making a disarming feature debut in the title role."
Goldie,Goldie explodes with energy and hope.
Light From Light,"[Light From Light] knows that the most resonant movie isn't a creed, but a question."
Light From Light,"Nothing ever happens of any importance in Light From Light and nothing makes any sense, including the title."
Light From Light,"Light From Light concerns ghost hunting, but Harrill characterizes the process in practical, mundane terms; it's the emotional implications of the endeavor that interest him."
Light From Light,I'm tempted to call 'Light from Light' the first ghost story I've ever seen that I completely believe.
Light From Light,"For a movie about grief, it's surprisingly even-handed, not too melancholic, heavy or existential but mostly pensive."
Light From Light,"Sure, Sheila has some ""ghosts,"" and her large eyes carry the weariness of her past, but don't worry about getting struck with that metaphor: Harrill is a far more skilled and subtle director than that."
Light From Light,Only in focusing so thoroughly on the normal does Paul Harrill's film stumble upon the paranormal.
Light From Light,"Paul Harrill's Light from Light is a quiet moving testament to grief, transition, and love."
Light From Light,A movie this modest requires patience and generosity and a rejection of expectations...But it is a gem likely to stay with anyone smart enough to seek it out.
Light From Light,"A quietly matter-of-fact drama that utilizes a ""haunting"" story hook for non-religious yet affirming ends."
Light From Light,"Modest in scale but rich in sensitivity, this is an unassuming film, made all the more transfixing by its defining delicacy and understatement."
Mr. Klein,This unique vision of war-torn France under the Occupation mixes political thriller and surreal fable in a heady brew.
Mr. Klein,"A masterpiece of identity crisis - a mesmeric cat-and-mouse played out in dreadful, ever-lengthening shadows."
Mr. Klein,[Director Joseph] Losey has created a wholly admirable work of art.
Mr. Klein,"Moody, elegantly disturbing and impeccably made by a master director, this story of blurred identities and casual immorality in German-occupied Paris benefits from what might be the best performance of star Alain Delon's long career..."
Mr. Klein,"Both a work of history, unstinting in its concrete depiction of political hatred and fear, and a portrait of the metaphysics of tyranny-a classic of doppelgänger paranoia that gathers the theme on a single string and pulls it into modernity."
Mr. Klein,The miracle of the film is that Losey had the imaginative guts to probe his own fears and failings.
The Roads Not Taken,"The Roads Not Taken is frequently moving, and a fascinating creative idea, but without sufficient information about Leo's character to anchor the narrative, it feels too abstract."
The Roads Not Taken,"It's a chamber piece in many ways, but with bold flashback excursions that come close to causing its emotional engine to overheat."
The Roads Not Taken,"[T]hat's it. That's the film. Three different Javier Bardems moaning solidly, sometimes crying, and struggling to write, for 85 minutes."
The Roads Not Taken,"The Roads Not Taken, an understated drama from Sally Potter, is rich with small moments of intimacy."
The Roads Not Taken,"A sad, timely story of family and fragility."
The Roads Not Taken,"Elle Fanning and Sally Potter triumph again. It's not always an easy watch, but The Roads Not Taken tackles a distressing subject with care and invites us to reconsider our preconceptions."
The Roads Not Taken,"The Roads Not Taken is not as narratively straightforward as any of Sally Potter's preceding works, but it delivers an unbelievably clear plea for compassion."
The Roads Not Taken,"At its root, ""The Roads Not Taken"" is not an examination of where we go or don't go in life, but who we choose to go there with."
The Roads Not Taken,Potter's lesser efforts - of which The Roads Not Taken is sadly one - are still undeniably superior to the vast bulk of movies being made today.
The Roads Not Taken,"After an hour of this tedium, you stop worrying about where this disaster is going-or if it's going anywhere at all."
The Roads Not Taken,"Audiences may find it a struggle to like Leo. A struggle to like the film. That's unfortunate, since so many adults are becoming caregivers to parents with dementia."
The Roads Not Taken,The film that surrounds [Fanning] is sadly no match for the qualities she brings to Potter's profoundly personal narrative.
The Roads Not Taken,"Despite the noble ambitions of writer-director Sally Potter (""Orlando, ""The Party""), ""The Roads Not Taken"" proves a morose and baffling drama; a painful, snail's-paced 85 minutes with little payoff."
The Roads Not Taken,"A movie one is apt to recommend with a caveat of ""if you're up for it."""
The Roads Not Taken,At once a baffling experience and a remarkably delicate one.
The Roads Not Taken,"Despite a deeply expressive performance from Javier Bardem as an an author suffering from early-onset dementia, Sally Potter's deeply personal film stubbornly refuses to come to life."
The Roads Not Taken,"While it's touching how Potter tries to restore a measure of humanity to someone who's being robbed of what little they have left, her movie never takes you anywhere because there's nowhere for Leo to return."
The Roads Not Taken,The film is an unending source for the worst possible clichés and most overdone series of graphic matches in the history of film editing.
The Roads Not Taken,"Potter's ambitious film may sound intriguing on paper - after all, we all affected to some degree by the events of our past - but the execution is sorely lacking."
The Roads Not Taken,"If you'd told me it was a shelved adaptation of late Philip Roth done by Alejandro González Iñárritu in Birdman (or Biutiful) mode, I'd have believed it in a shot."
The Roads Not Taken,"This is ""therapy through filmmaking"" of the most alienating sort, in which Fanning represents a young woman who cares too much, while the movie gives audiences scant reason to care at all."
The Roads Not Taken,A strong cast keeps the familiar father-daughter dynamics afloat.
Babyteeth,"Mendelsohn and Davis are old pros, but he hasn't been anything like this good since Mississippi Grind five years ago, and it's hard not to credit this partly to her, a scene partner who's one of the best in the business."
Babyteeth,"Babyteeth is authentic and unexpected, thanks to both [director Shannon] Murphy's confident style and the nuanced script from Rita Kalnejais ..."
Babyteeth,"The kind of skittish, reckless film-making that makes you want to rush headlong into bad decisions and savour every last messy moment of the fallout."
Babyteeth,Shannon Murphy's Babyteeth ... makes for a thrillingly subversive work.
Babyteeth,"An inspired, un-schmaltzy antidote to the 'cancer weepie'."
Babyteeth,The best kind of surprise - a debut feature with bite.
Babyteeth,The loosey-goosey energy is a blast - enough to make the script feel fresh even when mining age-old themes.
Babyteeth,"This debut feature from Australian film-maker Shannon Murphy, adapted by Rita Kalnejais from her stage play, is well acted, heartfelt, beautifully filmed."
Babyteeth,"Shannon Murphy's debut film is a refreshing take on a familiar subgenre, offering a nuanced depiction of a family dealing with the worst-case scenario with humanity and sweetness."
Babyteeth,Shannon Murphy's direction keeps up the antic spirit with a jagged rhythm that mirrors the unpredictable state of mind at chez Finlay. You don't know what these characters are going to do next. Even more engaging is the fact they don't either.
Babyteeth,"A lovely, achey coming-of-age story that bursts with rare respect for its characters while tragedy peeks in through the curtains."
Babyteeth,"...messy, raw, brutal..."
Babyteeth,A beautiful little romantic movie.
Babyteeth,"This looks like it's a formula that you have seen before, but the way it is shot, the setting, and the performances give it a tense edge that is very unexpected."
Babyteeth,A breath of fresh air for the subgenre.
Babyteeth,[A] fresh take on the trope that plays something like a John Waters movie for the Billie Eilish generation.
Babyteeth,"But Murphy, making a strong feature debut, grasps that the difference between the theatrical and the cinematic is blurrier than we might think, and that the brand of psychological drama she's pursuing has rich antecedents in both traditions."
Babyteeth,"There are plenty of movies about terminally ill teens but ""Babyteeth"" dodges clichés and finds the truth and honesty in its characters."
Babyteeth,"Babyteeth gives its audience a lot to chew on, namely how we think about death, dependency, and agency. It isn't a film that patronizes its sick protagonist or sees her as less than human because of a diagnosis."
Babyteeth,"Eliza Scanlen mainlines its young protagonist with herky-jerky energy and otherness as she rapturously loses herself in music, dancing and the swells of first love."
Babyteeth,"Despite a rocky and overly quirky intro, Mendelsohn and Davis are equally superb as parents and partners trying to cling onto their daughter for as long as they can and drifting apart in the process."
Babyteeth,"Death and friendship, addiction and love, and the immense gallows humor that comes with just living are all knocking around inside Babyteeth, and the result is fresh, hilarious, and heartbreaking."
Babyteeth,Murphy succeeds in making her non-maudlin take on a mostly maudlin format in large part because of Scanlen...
Babyteeth,Babyteeth avoids almost every cliche you might expect in this kind of material.
Babyteeth,"Love, death and the whole damn thing seen through the eyes of a teen played by the gifted Eliza Scanlen. Shannon Murphy's debut feature is a thing of beauty and terror that means to hit you hard - and boy, does it ever."
Babyteeth,"A tender, raw-nerved portrait of adolescent longing and first love."
Babyteeth,"Moments come along, not just a few but many, that stop your heart, leave you grinning with delight or watching breathlessly."
Babyteeth,Babyteeth is a savage wonder
Babyteeth,"""Babyteeth"" is such a fragile, earnest and inoffensive thing that I almost feel bad for not liking it more."
Babyteeth,"A lovely, eccentric little film."
Babyteeth,"There's a lot of heavy lifting involved, but the movie works."
Babyteeth,"Murphy isn't afraid to play with color and light and text and music, or to let her characters dance like no one is watching, and often. That energy is what puts this coming-of-age film into a class all its own."
Babyteeth,"Mendelsohn and Davis are reliably excellent, each taking what could be boilerplate portraits of fraying parents and turning them into vividly individual people."
Babyteeth,"It incorporates addiction, age-inappropriate romance, mental illness, and terminal disease into its plot without collapsing into a movie-of-the-week black hole."
Babyteeth,"""Babyteeth is deliciously astute on the sometimes bizarre everyday arcana of domestic life."""
Babyteeth,"Does it all work? Not quite, but you can't fault a film for its ambition, least of all one that does manage to bring it all together for a deeply moving home stretch."
Babyteeth,Murphy has marked herself as one to watch for sprightly direction and storytelling that doesn't feel the need to spell out every plot progression. And Scanlen has confirmed her status as one of the most promising young actors on either side of the world.
Babyteeth,"Though not without its niggles, this is a notable first feature from Murphy, who exudes a supreme confidence in her deployment of crisp visuals and the lightly bifurcated manner in which she unfurls this eccentric yarn."
Babyteeth,It keeps you on your toes from the moment it starts...
Babyteeth,"A wickedly perverse and, in time, intensely moving variation on familiar coming-of-age themes that marks an arresting feature debut for both director Shannon Murphy and screenwriter Rita Kalnejais."
Babyteeth,Takes a maddening route to a satisfying destination.
Farewell Amor,Ekwa Msangi’s debut feature attempts to give a fresh spin on the American immigrant story.
Farewell Amor,"The best thing I can say about Farewell Amor is that it's its own movie, the opposite of I'm Thinking of Ending Things..."
Farewell Amor,"One of the great strengths of Farewell Amor is its intimacy, the sense it conveys of three people close together yet emotionally distant in Walter's small, narrow Brooklyn apartment. Another strength, and a huge one, is Mr. Mwine's portrayal of Walter."
Farewell Amor,"There are three sides to every story in Ekwa Msangi's vivid and carefully observed feature debut, and so she cleverly splits the film into thirds, replaying the action but changing the vantage point with each chapter."
Farewell Amor,An accomplished feature film debut from writer and director Ekwa Msangi.
Farewell Amor,An auspicious start to a career that's likely to accelerate fast.
Farewell Amor,"Its gentle, understated tone belies Msangi's careful attention to rhythm and detail, though the simplicity of the plot, particularly in a few mild contrivances, slightly undermines the story's authenticity."
Farewell Amor,"It's low-key, captivating, [and] so well acted."
Farewell Amor,"A compassionate, empathetic, and moving exploration of love and family, and what these ideas can even mean after so long apart."
Farewell Amor,"The performances sell it, especially from Lawson, who comes out a real shining star, not just in her obvious dancing abilities, but in how she telegraphs so much with so little."
Farewell Amor,"In her feature film debut, writer/director Msangi reveals the maturity of her storytelling talent and her strong aptitude for eliciting terrific performances from her actors."
Farewell Amor,Its beauty lies in its empathy - something currently in short supply and therefore very welcome in the stories we consume.
Farewell Amor,Msangi and cinematographer Bruce Francis Cole capture the various experiences at play in Farewell Amor with equal sensitivity.
Farewell Amor,"Even with its share of conventional elements, Farewell Amor never plays out quite as you might expect."
Farewell Amor,Msangi's film succeeds because each character is flawed and human and just trying to do the best they can against sizable obstacles.
Farewell Amor,"Even as ""Farewell Amor"" treads familiar paths, its tripartite structure allows for uncommon nuance."
Farewell Amor,Ultimately this family drama is very touching and it finds its path. Wait for it.
Farewell Amor,"As tender as it is terrifically acted, ""Farewell Amor"" tells an immigrant tale that will seem familiar to many but leaves a very specific impression."
Farewell Amor,"It's the sheer, almost sensual fluidity of Farewell Amor which lingers."
Farewell Amor,"It's a captivating and well-acted character study about connection, loss and the emotional labor needed for second chances."
Farewell Amor,Msangi's film casts a spell with her lived-in script.
Farewell Amor,A moving exploration of the meaning of home.
Farewell Amor,"""Farewell Amor"" marks the arrival of an exciting new talent in Msangi, with the three lives it details doubtlessly representing only the tip of an iceberg of stories she has yet to tell."
Last Call,ERROR
Bang Bang,ERROR
Herself,"It's got foundations rooted in reality. The body off the house is in-between the dream and the fulfillment, and it's roof has its head in the air...I enjoyed it very much."
Herself,"Lloyd makes something genuinely nightmarish of the worst attacks, but Dunne's creased vulnerability ... keeps us tethered to waking reality."
Herself,"Dunne, who also co-wrote the script, brings admirable grit and pathos to her character without allowing her to become a victim. Still, the film's abrupt tonal shifts are jarring."
Herself,"Herself is smart in the way it balances the importance of individual charity and the need for wider reform - one provides the hope, the other provides the answers."
Herself,Lloyd's radical fairytale is enchanting.
Herself,"This is never maudlin and never tips into sentimentality. Lloyd's direction is so sure and restrained that she somehow manages to balance the raw, hard-hitting, viscerally impactful scenes with the lighter, hopeful ones."
Herself,Mamma Mia! director Phyllida Lloyd takes a welcome swerve into social realism for this visceral drama...
Herself,"There's a strong basis of originality here, and the warmth and good nature of the movie carries it along."
Herself,"Herself tells a compelling story, but combining a tough realist drama about domestic abuse and homelessness with an optimistic tale of solidarity weakens the foundations of this otherwise admirable film."
Herself,Herself doesn't take the easy road but it's that choice which makes it such a human story.
Herself,"Herself is a small, modest film but a surprisingly powerful one thanks mainly to Dunne's portrait of a courageous, resilient woman..."
Herself,The script is smart enough to avoid the usual feelgood cliches and sentimental flourishes and Lloyd's cast of plain-speaking British and Irish actors ensures that everybody remains firmly in touch with the gritty realities.
Herself,It's filled with touching scenes that reflect a mother's resilient devotion to her children as she strives to shape a better life.
Herself,[A] perfectly beautiful and very moving movie.
Herself,"Some of the major beats in ""Herself"" verge on cliché but everything in between rings true thanks to Dunne's steadfast performance and the film's delicate sense of humanity."
Herself,"Herself ticks off all the standard boxes of restoring faith in humanity, but it is a temporary and unmemorable high."
Herself,"The sudden acknowledgement that a person you once loved doesn't exist anymore can knock the wind out of you, and Dunne captures that breathless free fall beautifully."
Herself,"In the end, this tender drama feels like an Irish proverb spun in light, warning of cruelty and promising care, all with a crisp wit."
Herself,"""Herself"" is more honest than most about the PTSD of partner abuse, and in Dunne's nuanced and heartfelt performance we see the inner strength that keeps Sandra going at war with the terror that never goes away."
Herself,"[Lloyd] is not afraid of reaching for big emotions, utilizing inspirational needle-drops and montages that show the house coming into existence. But there's something else going on here, something that makes all of this a deeper and more powerful story."
Herself,Little details add a lot of richness to the story.
Herself,"As trite as ""Herself"" is in plot and emotional beats, what makes it worthwhile are the performances, which are all stellar"
Herself,Dunne is a remarkably vulnerable actress... and her pain becomes ours.
Herself,"This Irish drama has major turns that are riveting, powerful and unexpected, but most of it is rather flat and sentimental."
Herself,"Dunne performance is quietly assured; Sandra's strength may waver, but it never falters. You root for her. You root for the movie, something that Lloyd purposely makes difficult to do at times."
Herself,"For the most part, Dunne achieves her goals as a writer, social commentator, women's advocate and soul-searching actress. Her intelligence and creativity are a certain sign of good things to come."
Herself,"Herself bulks far larger than any would-be blockbuster with a shriveled spirit if measured by depth of feeling, sheer delight and genuine surprise, even shock."
Herself,"For the most part, ""Herself,"" with its easygoing bonhomie and coterie of solid performances, allows one to look past the narrative's guardrail dents until a regrettable late swerve toward jarring punishment."
Herself,This is a feminist movie with a Sisyphean dimension that's disquietingly universal.
Herself,...cannot escape its own somewhat mundane self-set contours.
Herself,"[T]hanks to Dunne's quietly powerful performance as a single mother barely treading water, the end result is an effective, affecting look at community triumphing over fear."
Herself,The film may get by on a great deal of presumed audience goodwill. But I felt my arm being twisted - and resisted.
Herself,"If there is a lot of ""happy coincidence"" driving the plot, Dunne gets away with it by constructing this tale of female resilience and community from the ground up, through well-observed moments between mother and daughters."
Herself,"With her elegant, restrained and quietly devastating performance as a headstrong yet financially struggling single-mother of two young girls, Clare Dunne is a revelation [in Herself]."
Herself,"So many films are branded 'urgent' nowadays, but in the case of Herself the term really does feel apt."
Herself,"At least there's Walter on hand to twinkle knowingly, delivering her lines in a crisp, pitch-perfect Irish accent, those stiletto sharp cheekbones cutting a dash through the treacle."
Herself,"A stunning, taut performance from actor and co-writer Dunne cuts through a flurry of clumsy good intentions to convince. The film is at its most powerful when it rests on her traumatised face."
Herself,"While Dunn and Campbell's script is occasionally given over to cliches, ""Herself"" often manages to subvert them at the last minute..."
Herself,"[A] timely, empowering story about a battered wife who builds her own house, and the decent folks who come to her aid in that endeavor."
The Other Lamb,"Very well done. It has a very sinister, impressive atmosphere with these little flashes of surreal horror..."
The Other Lamb,The atmosphere of frontier decay and misogynistic oppression is sufficiently well maintained to sustain attention throughout
The Other Lamb,"Take the film as a pared-back cousin to The Handmaid's Tale. But if some elements seem familiar, Szumowska has aces of her own to play."
The Other Lamb,Still waiting for female-directed horror films which break the genre's misogynistic tropes.
The Other Lamb,"Szumowska and cinematographer Michal Englert encase her story in strikingly beautiful landscapes, and Cassidy makes the case that she's one of the most adventurous young actors out there."
The Other Lamb,What you're left with is not so much a story as a concept presented handsomely but very frustratingly.
The Other Lamb,"The Other Lamb is the type of film that leaves audiences thinking about its images and ideas once the folky credits song begins to play, and for hours afterward."
The Other Lamb,"The Other Lamb is not a subtle allegory, but it never claims to be. Rather, it's a phoenix rising from the ashes..."
The Other Lamb,"Set in some indeterminate time and place rarely betrayed by modern technology or dress, The Other Lamb mostly operates in the realm of allegory."
The Other Lamb,"Beautiful, anguished, and defiant, The Other Lamb offers a cult horror story that is splashed with violence and blood, but uses neither to express its deepest scares."
The Other Lamb,"What makes The Other Lamb feel fresh is how Szumowska renders her world - in vivid colors and inky blacks, with slow zooms that turn their placid, pastoral lives into something uncanny."
The Other Lamb,"It's about as subtle as a brick through a windshield. But in Szumowksa's capable hands, with Cassidy as her anchor, this one leaves a haunting aftertaste."
The Other Lamb,"Although The Other Lamb is heavy-handed in every conceivable way and a few ways you'd never have conceived of, it has a special resonance in the spring of 2020."
The Other Lamb,The constant focus on the suffering the film's women endure feels unwarranted in light of how thin the story ultimately is.
The Other Lamb,"As a study in atmospheric seclusion, ""The Other Lamb"" is beautifully crafted enough to hold your attention, but you can't shake the feeling that Selah's next chapter - and Cassidy's - might well be the more interesting movie."
The Other Lamb,"In reinforcing their themes of religious and cultural oppression, [Szumowska and McMullen] hit the nail too squarely on the head."
The Other Lamb,"As wonderful as The Other Lamb appears on screen and its cast embodies the story's tension, it feels as if there is missing something from the final picture."
The Other Lamb,"Existing outside of time and place, ""The Other Lamb"" is a gorgeous revenge fable with an excess of atmosphere and zero subtlety - a mallet wrapped in gauze and girlish laughter."
The Other Lamb,"Szumowska is a visually confident director capable of constructing some magnificent imagery, but it's a film that's forever threatening to be more style than substance."
The Other Lamb,"""The Other Lamb"" is slow-moving but never dull, because the world of it is so distinct and odd."
The Other Lamb,"An impressive English-language debut for one of Poland's most compelling contemporary filmmakers, The Other Lamb is engrossing, thoughtful and unhesitating in its ideological messaging."
The Other Lamb,"Unless you are into the warped imagery of trees and dead animals, it can seem like an incredible slog like the many hikes the women have to trudge through to reach the pinnacle ""Eden."""
The Other Lamb,"After a while, all these visual poetics start to feel like a pretentious means of suggesting enigmatic depth where there really is none."
The Other Lamb,Malgorzata's command of her medium makes the film a pleasure to watch...
In the Life of Music,ERROR
Human Capital,"The efficient writing and effective direction is a bit too swift to let some of the plot points fully land, and it's tied up with far too neat a bow for such an otherwise complicated story."
Human Capital,"All of these wonderful performances... Unfortunately, they're forced to speak every thought in the filmmakers' head about the haves and the have nots of society."
Human Capital,"I think the performances were great and the concept was solid. It was engrossing, but ultimately the resolution to mystery feels a little unsatisfying."
Human Capital,Damned if Human Capital doesn't undermine and undervalue its actors even when it's giving them rock-solid material to play.
Human Capital,"Frankly, the payoff to the movie's mystery is unsatisfying after all the buildup. None of these three stories really works as a short film on its own."
Human Capital,"If you find hedge funds hard to wrap your head around, the movie ""Human Capital"" won't do much to ease the confusion."
Human Capital,A character study that hasn't done its homework.
Human Capital,"The type of middling, middlebrow mediocrity that strives to be about capital-I Ideas but approaches them with the savoir-faire of a toddler."
Human Capital,The solid performances and assured packaging make this a reasonably engrossing tale set in a convincingly upscale burg where some less-prosperous citizens are trying not to make their anxiety too obvious.
Human Capital,A beautifully acted narrative braid whose strands support each other imperfectly.
Resistance,"The film is lazily manipulative here, as the sounds of an angelic children's choir are contrasted with scenes of brutal executions."
Resistance,Eisenberg simply doesn't convince as Marceau for a moment...
Resistance,This was a film worth making and its mere existence does honour to an extraordinary life. We're better with it than without it.
Resistance,"As a film, it wasn't brilliant, but still gripping with many set pieces that work very well...I came out wanting to know more...flawed, not perfect, but fascinating and uplifting..."
Resistance,"Resistance may be good enough at what it does, but what it does is more horse manure than history."
Resistance,It's ultimately useless as veracious historical drama.
Resistance,A handsomely executed production sadly let down by a rather pedestrian screenplay.
Resistance,"Resistance fails to commit to anything: too confused to honour its hero, too generic to shine a new light on a crucial moment in history."
Resistance,It's a very notable story but this is another of those sepia second world war films for which there continues to be a solid market.
Resistance,"The result is strangely distracted, a pity for a story rich enough to be told just like it is."
Resistance,Resistance is like a maudlin Robin Williams vehicle inorganically fused with a by-the-numbers wartime thriller.
Resistance,"The Second World War drama Resistance, however, possesses a style that can be summed up as simply formulaic."
Resistance,"It feels important to remember what humans can endure in the darkest hours, and that those hours can pass. Most significantly, Resistance is a reminder of the truly lifesaving work of artists."
Resistance,"It felt very teenager-y to me, but I'm so thrilled to now know the Marcel Marceau story."
Resistance,Jakubowicz handles these threads with coherence and vigor.
Resistance,"Marceau truly was a hero who carried his sadness into his work, and Resistance is an honorable, absorbing homage to the making of a man and his art."
Resistance,An involving if imperfect look at humanism amidst atrocity.
Resistance,"The truth is, even if young Marcel didn't go on to become a major artist, this was a story worth telling."
Resistance,"Playing the iconic mime Marcel Marceau in his early days as a French Resistance fighter for Jewish children, Eisenberg acts with physical finesse and deep feeling, proving that the power of art can literally be a saving grace."
Resistance,"""Resistance"" feels disjointed and dated."
Resistance,"His best work comes at the mime's first real public performance, where he dons the white makeup and silently mimes his way through the war itself: Without a single word, he articulates the film's point more movingly than any monologue ever could."
Resistance,"""Resistance"" can't stop finding new reasons to ignore its protagonist, or flatten him into anonymity."
Resistance,Resistance functions as a handsomely mounted biopic that tells a little-known story with considerable passion.
Resistance,"The darkness Marceau must have grappled with, after witnessing what he did during the war, is soul-crushing."
Lie Exposed,"At times, Lie Exposed comes across like a more coherent version of the Terrence Malick formula.Expect time-jumping, voice-over, and plenty of navel-gazing."
Lie Exposed,A bit too quasi- sophisticated and indulgent for my taste.
Lie Exposed,"It tries to charm us and pull us into its embrace, but this viewer isn't feeling wooed."
Lie Exposed,"Lie Exposed is ambitious, but it's never quite as shocking, raw, or life-changing as it wants to be. The overall impression, to steal from Lana Del Rey, is beautiful people with beautiful problems."
Lie Exposed,"Not even a gifted squad of veteran Canuck actors can elevate this limp, forced drama which never locates its emotional centre."
Lie Exposed,"There's a great film somewhere in Lie Exposed, but even its few truthful moments evoke better films like Closer, Unfaithful, We Don't Live Here Anymore, Last Night, and the collected works of Atom Egoyan."
AIR,"Air is a quick-paced entertainer with glib dialogue, humour and a wonderful sense of nostalgia for the 1980s."
AIR,"Once you’ve made peace with those really narrow parameters, what you see on screen – ie virtually nothing of Jordan himself – kind of works."
AIR,"There’s not an ounce of fat on this film’s physique, and Affleck keeps the pace moving even though everything that’s happening is entirely driven by the dialogue."
AIR,"Affleck is a fine actor and a better-than-fine director. As an actor since childhood, his skill at selecting the right actors and allowing them to do their best is to be expected. He also has an exceptional sense of narrative structure."
AIR,"Affleck, the cast, crew and script put you in a time capsule and take you back to the ’80s."
AIR,Ben Affleck's got a great feel for this real-life stories.
AIR,Nostalgia is the only reason I can think of to explain why old friends Ben Affleck and Matt Damon reteamed for a movie that so artlessly sets out to make us love shoe company Nike for buttering up a college hoops star better than Adidas or Converse.
AIR,"While much of Affleck's casting choices in Air err on the side of superb, one pivotal choice is repeatedly jarring: He doesn't cast Michael Jordan."
AIR,"The script is pacy, the tone is consistent, and Affleck’s deft direction commands a raft of skilful performances from an ensemble who rarely puts a foot wrong."
AIR,"For all its affable charm, there’s something slippery and disingenuous about this film."
AIR,"""Air"" is effortlessly entertaining, but it wants to be about more than just the marketing triumph of an underdog shoe company."
AIR,The film certainly invites fists to be pumped in celebration. It is less certain Air offers any meaningful critique of the society that gave us the sacred gutty.
AIR,"Affleck’s return to the director’s chair is an exceptional success, stimulated by its script and cast."
AIR,"The decision to deny Jordan a character presence... conspicuously muzzles a pivotal character and it’s clumsily out of step with a movie that is otherwise the definition of carefully considered, precisely told, error-free film-making."
AIR,"As much as we can talk about the thematic resonance of Air, its impact is dependent on your personal connection to Michael Jordan. It’s like going to church as an atheist — you might be able to follow the story, but its meaning is lost."
AIR,"Air mainly takes place in drab offices, yet the cast’s expert performances transform those spaces much in the same way that Michael Jordan transformed courts and sneaker racks -- by turning them into sites of magic."
AIR,"A solid exercise in brand mythology, putting the “commercial” in commercial filmmaking, but one with such a predestined outcome that all its Mad Men-esque wheeling and dealing can’t mask the sensation of all its characters running in place."
AIR,"It’s a feel-good fable for a culture that doesn’t know how not to win, and it’s going to be huge."
AIR,"The film wants to be a wing-ding entertainment, but it also strives to say Something Important. The first half of that equation is what makes the movie eminently worth watching."
AIR,"Air is great. Pitch-perfect, deeply entertaining."
AIR,"The boldest thing I can say about Air is that it follows the tried-and-true underdog sports movie formula, only none of its main characters even attempt a shot much less sink the game-winner at the buzzer."
AIR,"Director Ben Affleck slam dunks a film about a basketball sneaker (the Air Jordan) and it’s the first all-star Oscar contender of 2023, an outrageously entertaining classic with Affleck, Matt Damon, Viola Davis and a cast of MVPs at the top of their game."
AIR,"""Air"" is a meaningful movie but an unsatisfying one."
AIR,Ben Affleck and Matt Damon’s story of Nike’s paradigm-shifting deal with Michael Jordan is both a great time at the theater and an odd valorization of an already all-powerful brand
AIR,"Air is thoroughly entertaining, even if it never really maximizes its alluring potential."
AIR,"Even given the benefit of every possible doubt, Air is pretty thin."
AIR,"It plays like pure television by an Aaron Sorkin disciple, and there is no reason whatsoever to see this on the big screen."
AIR,"The only problem facing Air is that people may be expecting a bigger movie. This is a modest, entertaining behind-the-scenes film about the marketing whiz who believed in Jordan when he was still a rookie"
AIR,"Coupled with a near-fetishistic attachment to the material indicators of the decade, it’s hard to land on a reason for any of this to exist beyond a goosing up of Nike’s own image."
AIR,"The film is a love letter to consumerism wrapped in a corporate legend, inside a feelgood workplace comedy. The result is so deeply un-dystopian..."
AIR,"This is the most Ben Affleck movie: taking queasy material and making it earnest, sentimental, likeable and soft-around-the-edges."
AIR,An energetic take on an iconic sneaker – if not the icon himself.
AIR,"It’s another win for Affleck as a director. I had a whale of a time, despite knowing almost nothing about the subject matter."
AIR,Ben Affleck’s drama excludes Jordan from his own story.
AIR,"Michael Jordan reportedly insisted on Davis as his mom, which suggests he might have a future as a casting director."
AIR,The entire cast does some of their best work.
AIR,"While material like this might sound like it could be deadly dull for anyone uninterested in sports and shoes, Affleck’s heartwarming story holds appeal for all."
AIR,"Air feels like a gently satirical movie about corporate skullduggery. But it’s really a sports picture, where outcomes are determined by dedication, and a purity of purpose no one else can match."
AIR,"Unsurprisingly, the well-worn Matt-and-Ben screen rapport gives Sonny and Phil an instantly readable, affectionately combative dynamic, as well as an understated emotional core."
AIR,Watching Sonny and Deloris square off here is where the film's real heart and tension are.
AIR,Air is that rare sports movie that is virtually guaranteed to appeal to both hardcore NBA fans and people who don’t know a three-point line from a field goal
AIR,"Air coasts quite well on its compelling, funny and self-aware script and charismatic movie stars. And Damon, who gets one show-stopping monologue, is the perfect actor to carry the film in his first time acting for his old pal."
AIR,"A well-oiled machine of a movie, as slick and convincing as its obvious show-me-the-money inspiration. It had me at, “Just Do It.”"
AIR,"This movie, in short, kneels at the altar of high capitalism."
AIR,It’s far and away the most likable film released so far this year.
AIR,"Consider this framing all in the name of a thrilling cinematic experience that serves the main objective of every film: to tell a great story. And “Air” is a riotous, worthwhile and surprisingly heartfelt film that does just that."
AIR,A biopic with real sole.
AIR,"For the most part, [Air] is as smooth and reliable as one of Jordan’s buzzer-beating, fadeaway jumpers."
AIR,"A soulless dramatization of how a giant corporation convinced a promising NBA rookie to make its already wealthy and well-off board members, CEOs, and salespeople even wealthier and set for life."
AIR,"This film winds up looking like the most expensive in-house corporate promo in history: shallow, parochial and obtuse."
AIR,"Ben Affleck’s film reminds viewers that the boardroom game can be as tense, unpredictable, and exhilarating as the one on the court."
AIR,"Affleck’s treatise on the film industry and the perils of celebrity, shoehorned into a biopic of a brand... Affleck applies just the right elements to make it sing."
AIR,"A rousing underdog saga that—like Ben Affleck’s prior directorial efforts Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo—has the type of snappy energy and charm that should earn it a long post-theatrical shelf life."
AIR,"“Air” is that most familiar and satisfying of movie stories: believing in yourself and persuading other people to accept your quest, despite long odds and questionable methods."
AIR,"It’s ridiculous how entertaining “Air” is given that it’s about shoes, even if it works overtime to persuade you that it’s also about other, nobler truths, too."
AIR,"Air is smartly acted and agreeably paced, a drama of invention that warmly invites the audience into an interesting process... [But] I am finding it hard to be moved by stories of lucrative business. Congrats, I guess?"
AIR,Affleck stacks the odds so high against Sonny and his team that it feels like hitting a game-winning shot when Jordan agrees to the deal.
AIR,"Coasts by on good will and a real-life success story piggybacking on another real-life success story, until Davis shows up and turns it into something deeper."
AIR,"Capturing the nexus between sports and business in a glow of ’80s nostalgia, it is, like its inspiration, a winner."
AIR,"Air is a good time, as well as a triumph of sports marketing in every conceivable way."
AIR,Only Affleck and Damon could turn this tale of corporate triumph into a scrappy underdog story.
AIR,The year's best film so far...
AIR,Messina steals scenes as the highly strung sports agent...
AIR,"It’s old-fashioned in the best sense: solid, confident, simple, straightforward and entirely entertaining. It’s the work of an intelligent classicist."
AIR,"“Air” isn’t a documentary, it's better — a brilliantly acted, fascinating true story."
AIR,“Air” lands like a classic Michael Jordan dunk – you can even imagine Affleck’s tongue wagging and legs splayed in mid-jump akin to his Airness.
AIR,An engaging and entertaining trip down memory lane and behind-the-scenes story that turns a seemingly minor moment in sports history — the development of a shoe that became a pop-cultural touchstone — into something often funny and occasionally moving.
AIR,"A crowd-pleaser made with panache and smarts. Matt Damon is immensely appealing as a middle-aged basketball guru who bets everything on landing Michael Jordan, and director Ben Affleck produces one of his most irresistibly entertaining dramas."
AIR,"Alex Convery’s script frames the story half as a Moneyball-like cracking of the sports world’s cosmic code, half as a Jerry Maguire-style triumph against the corporate odds."
AIR,"Air is shot through with an infectious energy, but it’s more poignant for the way that it rhymes the histories of its actors in the public eye with all that Nike’s creatives were struggling to reconcile when they were chasing after Michael Jordan."
AIR,"In his fifth feature film, Ben Affleck’s talents exceed expectations. He’s grown as an actor and director but is best when doing both."
AIR,"It’s a lot of fun, way more than a film about a large company striving to make even more money should be. But it could have paid a little more heed to #3 on Nike’s famous list of ten corporate principles: “Break the rules.”"
AIR,"Affleck remains one of the directors who can disguise a powerful parable as giddy, crowd-pleasing entertainment."
AIR,"The banter in Convery’s script is entertaining, but it’s truly the actors under Affleck’s excellent direction that makes “Air” feel like something special. It doesn’t nail every scene or sentiment; but when the film is good (which is often), it’s on fire."
AIR,"Not a slam dunk, but scores enough points."
AIR,"Casting Davis was the smartest thing Affleck could have done, as the EGOT winner is to acting what Jordan is to sports: Her strength inspires, and she can move us to tears while making it look easy."
AIR,AIR is a slam dunk and ultimately one of the best sports movies ever made.
Jesus Revolution,Get thee behind me!
Jesus Revolution,"At first glance, Jesus Revolution is an inspiring, heartwarming watch, but it gives a seamlessly joyful look at a movement with a harmful past, in a way that feels like a slap in the face in the year of our Lord 2023."
Jesus Revolution,"Although there are very frank discussions about the nature of faith, it doesn't feel as preachy or heavy-handed as a lot of these films do, which to me personally makes them off-putting."
Jesus Revolution,"Unfortunately, despite the interesting history, the film itself is a dry, scattered slog, neutered of all the thorny, contradictory details of the real story."
Jesus Revolution,"A gently told story preaching to the converts, assuming that evangelical Christianity is unassailably the answer without considering this particular form of worship may not be the answer for all."
Jesus Revolution,"Nothing in this evangelical film about a short-lived religious movement taking root in late Sixties Southern California... is open to chance, much less to any interpretation other than an unequivocal One."
Jesus Revolution,"One of the most appealing faith-based big-screen entertainments in a while, polished and persuasive without getting too preachy."
Jesus Revolution,"Jesus Revolution takes a fascinating period of American history – the hippie movement and its associated fallout within the Christian community – and transforms it into a bland, TV movie-of-the-week experience."
Jesus Revolution,"It’s easy to be dismissive of the moviemaking, in what often feels like a church production of Hair. Other times it felt like watching an infomercial hawking something that already has billions of people buying what they’re selling."
The Artist’s Wife,Massively unremarkable...
The Artist’s Wife,Olin's great... Just not great enough.
The Artist’s Wife,"Lacking the boldness of originality and substantial character development, The Artist's Wife nonetheless showcases Olin's best performance in years and a brittle brilliance from Dern."
The Artist’s Wife,"Olin portrays Claire's disappointment compellingly, with intelligence and gentle depth."
The Artist’s Wife,"Lovely acting, but that's about it."
The Artist’s Wife,"[A]n absorbing, at times moving look at a woman caught between her own artistic and emotional desires and her devotion to a man who doesn't seem to deserve her."
The Artist’s Wife,The Artist's Wife wastes compassion on a character who has earned only the minimum.
The Artist’s Wife,Lena Olin and Bruce Dern Excel in Tom Dolby's Drama About a Couple Coping With the Husband's Alzheimer's
The Artist’s Wife,"The final scene leaves you thinking: For a film about a woman recovering her lost identity, it doesn't really have much of its own."
The Artist’s Wife,"Like an exhausted artist facing a blank canvas, or an underwhelmed film critic staring at a blank screen, The Artist's Wife doesn't have much to say but tosses something on the screen regardless, hoping it will stick."
The Artist’s Wife,This cinematic portrait unfortunately never feels realistic or fully fleshed-out.
The Artist’s Wife,Even Olin is unable to salvage this pulpy portrait of a onetime artist who has laid aside her own talents to enable those of her husband.
The Artist’s Wife,"Dolby provides Dern with a chance to be cranky and vicious, but what else is new? The revelation here is Lena Olin, who gets her best role in years..."
The Artist’s Wife,Terrific performances help overcome narrative deficiencies.
The Artist’s Wife,"Alas, it opts for plangency, with a musical score applied like a gentle balm, and a plot that hungers for healing-absurdly so, given the incurable nature of Richard's plight."
Stardust,"The whole thing feels strangely pedestrian, unable to capture or channel Bowie's maverick spirit."
Stardust,"A by-the-numbers biopic that does a disservice to its star and subject, and sorely missing a killer soundtrack. Watch The Man Who Fell To Earth instead."
Stardust,Listen to your records. It's all there. There's nothing this film gives you that you didn't already know.
Stardust,"Exasperating viewing for fans and certain to baffle newcomers, it's a curious, imaginative thing, but who exactly is it for?"
Stardust,"Flynn carries off Bowie's clothes and delicate mannerisms plausibly enough and, impressively, he does his own singing. But, all too often, this Bowie looks as if he is presenting TV's Bake Off."
Stardust,"The clunk of it all is deafening, the dialogue booby-trapped."
Stardust,"The actor-musician, so magnetic in last year's EMMA., is convincing as a tortured glam rocker - just not the one who ever sang about Major Tom's interplanetary adventures."
Stardust,"Ultimately, it's bland, not bold, and achingly absent of enchantment."
Stardust,"Teeth aside, [Johnny Flynn]'s a serviceable Bowie look-alike, though the high cost of Bowie's music rights means he only gets to sing covers of other artists' tunes."
Stardust,"The portrayal of Bowie is trying to the viewer. His character is either a stumbling, fumbling, fawn-eyed space cadet or an articulate, erudite conversationalist, depending on Range's whim."
Stardust,[A] rock-star biopic without the music of said rock star ends up being a pointless exercise.
Stardust,"When it comes to revealing something new about its subject, ""Stardust"" sadly lacks insight into the art."
Stardust,"As Bowie takes everything in - the dingy motel rooms, the unappreciative audience - his expressions convey the obvious: he wishes this was better. It is hard not to have the same reaction to ""Stardust."""
Stardust,"Lacking the real-life Bowie's music, artistry, or charisma, Stardust's lackluster version is simply a mediocre jerk who needs roleplaying therapy to deal with his demons."
Stardust,A rough draft that seems to be missing quite a few elements to make a good idea into a great movie.
Stardust,"Stardust reaches a nadir in the already debased genre of rock-star docudramas. Low-budget LARPing, the film may be most memorable for the number of wigs that seem to have been scraped out of the bottom of a Party City remainder bin."
Stardust,"Even though Stardust is not coated in gossamer, the film still has some glittery moments."
Stardust,... a biopic that's too buttoned-up - and never as out-there as its inspiration.
Stardust,"Range catches a break by depicting a promo tour on which Bowie was forbidden from performing because of a visa problem, but it's still disconcerting to watch the genesis of an artist when you can't hear the art he's making."
Stardust,"Stardust is a mostly listless odyssey, its lack of excitement compounded by the absence of Bowie's music."
Stardust,"Given the excitement of the subject, what a prosaic and sodden journey it is!"
Just One More Kiss,"A moving story on the power of love and loss, detailing the various methods of coping with grief, Just One More Kiss begs for a second chance."
The Truth,ERROR
Guest Artist,...the train station not only confines the drama but comes close to flat-out stopping it in its tracks.
Guest Artist,"Guest Artist feels like a typical one-act, intelligent but not especially distinctive or compelling."
Guest Artist,"Timothy Busfield's adaptation of Daniels' stage play benefits from the two leads, and will particularly appeal to theater lovers."
Guest Artist,"Though its running time is brief and a lot of the writing is sharp, the tug-of-war between a onetime literary lion and his wide-eyed No. 1 fan lacks the necessary tension to make the drama's outcome matter."
You go to my Head,"De Clercq's clear directorial talent gives the film the illusion of respectability, but it can't remove the sweaty sheen of smarm."
You go to my Head,"The more opportunities director-producer-co-writer de Clercq takes to shoot Belgian model Delfine Bafort in various states of languorous undress, the more it starts to feel like we're watching a vanity wish-fulfillment fantasy."
You go to my Head,A stylishly suspenseful drama gains emotional resonance from impressive lead performances by Delfine Bafort and Svetozar Cvetkovic.
You go to my Head,"The movie is clamoring to erupt into melodrama, but de Clercq, content to wallow in teasingly luscious and enigmatically staged images, happily isn't listening."
You go to my Head,Gorgeous visuals and outstanding performances enhance this slow-burn drama.
Counter Column,"Those already in the choir may applaud this movie's preaching, but for others, it will likely feel like little more than a blatant recruiting tool, both for the chuch and for the Army."

"Never, Rarely, Sometimes, A…",I think it's the best film I've seen so far this year.

"Never, Rarely, Sometimes, A…","It's as complex as its logline suggests, but far more deft and subtle. It should be seen."

"Never, Rarely, Sometimes, A…","For those with a taste for serious, non-prefabricated dramas, this is worth seeking out."

"Never, Rarely, Sometimes, A…","Eliza Hitmann's devastating abortion drama, starring a wonder of an actress named Sidney Flanigan, is an emotional wipeout that's impossible to forget."

"Never, Rarely, Sometimes, A…",The most powerful moment in [Never Rarely Sometimes Always] is not one of confrontation but of self-realization.
"Never, Rarely, Sometimes, A…","An insightful observer and patient portrayer of contemporary American youth, the astonishing filmmaker [Eliza] Hittman gives her young cast the time and space to flex their visceral muscles, with long takes, close-ups and a deliberately empathetic lens."
"Never, Rarely, Sometimes, A…","Eliza Hittman builds on the quiet observational strengths of her previous films, and while this simple story may not seem inherently momentous, it speaks volumes about the ways in which women are marginalized in American society."
"Never, Rarely, Sometimes, A…",There's a sense of dread which haunts the film as its teenage protagonists attempt to navigate the complex healthcare system while also dealing with predatory men. But there's not an ounce of melodrama to be found.

Downtown 81,"Its bygone-ness still abuzz with creativity and movement, ""Downtown 81"" is a celluloid scrapbook that we can all be thankful for in helping capture the rumble before takeoff."
Downtown 81,"For anyone steeped in or curious about the often uncategorizable music made during this period, Downtown 81 is a joyous artifact."
Downtown 81,This time capsule of bohemian New York distorts its representation of the city for reasons more loving than lazy.
Downtown 81,"Viewers of 'Downtown 81' become de facto archaeologists. We peer into long-since-shuttered clubs, and gaze at rubble-filled lower Manhattan blocks where a Whole Foods or Capital One bank may now stand."
Downtown 81,"A fascinating if fragmented, dreamlike look at the downtown art-music-fashion scene of a yeasty, creative era."
Downtown 81,A crudely poetic inventory of the people and places about to rock pop culture.
Downtown 81,Performances by DNA and the Plastics alone are worth the price of admission.
Downtown 81,"Gives us a glimpse of the city as it was, suggesting that there was something revolutionary, even inspiring, about those days of not-so yore."
Downtown 81,It captures the youthful excitement of a burgeoning creative movement.
Downtown 81,It's as a documentary that Downtown 81 is most successful.
Downtown 81,"Amateurish in the extreme, the film is a feast of bohemian clich, bad writing and worse acting."
Downtown 81,"Presents a smug, self-satisfied vision of its own world."
Downtown 81,"Doesn't dawdle and, despite some eye-rolling dialogue, is a generally amiable time-trip."
Foster Boy,"Foster Boy highlights an issue we seldomly see on the big screen in the foster care system. Centered around the relationship between a middle aged white man and a young Black man, it is a refreshing dynamic that we need to see a lot more of onscreen."
Foster Boy,"If you want to see a film with great performances that talks about important issues while incorporating them into a compelling drama, watch this film if given the chance."
Foster Boy,"Even if the storytelling is oddly timid and obvious, and occasionally implausible, what emerges still manages to carry an enormous emotional punch. And it shines a light on an endemic problem."
Foster Boy,Sentimental courtroom drama about foster-care corruption.
Foster Boy,A well-acted but uneven melodrama that's easier to get behind than to endorse for its cinematic realism.
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,Gardner is indecently radiant.
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman is a Technicolored pastiche of symbolism, the supernatural and old romantic claptrap."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"Albert Lewin produced, directed and did the story and script, keeping this film on an almost unrelieved level of sombre depression."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"A simple love story, however improbable, can be enjoyed. But. this pair Indulge their love to the accompaniment of deep rumblings about fate and destiny... Their dialogue runs like a collection of philosophical cliches."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"Albert Lewin produced, wrote, and directed -- astonishingly, he managed to work again after this."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"Lewin in his story and his screenplay adroitly mingles these ingredients, and sets the narrative amid the poetic and flamboyant landscapes of nature and life in Spain."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"An intoxicating (or, possibly, intoxicated) mixture of surrealistic grandeur and balderdash, this 1951 movie sails on Jack Cardiff's succulent Technicolor cinematography."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,Jack Cardiff's superb Technicolor cinematography looks as beautiful as Gardner and that's substantially the reason the film has stood the test of time.
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"It's one of those unclassifiable efforts that threaten permanently to topple over the edge of ridiculousness, but somehow manage to avoid it."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"A timeless tale, beautifully remastered."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"Passionate, classical, mysterious and surreal all at once."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"In essaying a classic tragedy, Mr. Lewin has managed to fashion a long and fairly polished drama. But it is, after all, a saga that shines only fitfully."
Pandora and the Flying Dutc…,"This strange, neglected Technicolor fable, with photography that's edibly lush even by Jack Cardiff's standards, wasn't made by Powell and Pressburger, but feels as if it might have been."
Premature,It gives off a good summer vibe...[it] develops quite a summer romance...this is what indie films are here to do for us...a marvelous film.
Premature,"Premature is the kind of confident, remarkably vulnerable drama to which even veteran storytellers aspire."
Premature,"""Premature"" is a delicious slow-burn of a movie, the kind of coming-of-age tale that looks familiar on the surface only to reveal hidden depths of beauty and meaning."
Premature,"Rashaad Ernesto Green's poignant coming-of-age drama reflects his fruitful collaboration with Zora Howard, who wrote the script with him and also stars as Ayanna, a high-school senior in Harlem who is preparing to leave for college."
Premature,"It truly is an independent film in all the best possible ways: in the authenticity of it, the sense of place, in the fact that you feel like you're watching true people figuring out their lives."
Premature,"This film explores the very real ways that love heals, that it transforms, that it tests and changes us."
Premature,A romantic and richly drawn conversation-starter.
Premature,Rashaad Ernesto Green's innocently composed Premature... deeply [inhales] love with each earnest breath.
Premature,"To watch Ayanna quietly think her way through each situation - whether she's taking pleasure in a new experience or weighing the consequences of a difficult decision - is to watch a person coming into being, not a moment too soon or late."
Premature,"""Premature"" offers a ground-level alternative to more sensationalistic, adversity-themed African-American stories."
Premature,"""Premature"" doesn't break much new ground. But it sure breaks hearts."
Premature,"Green takes a slight story and packs it with attitude and feeling. Every moment rings true, the vividly textured locations and knockabout relationships more visited than created."
Premature,"Questions of art and the reasons to create it are threaded throughout, though the message never overbears the delicacy of the love story at hand."
Premature,"Though the script is dialogue-heavy, in a good way, Green also finds ways to deliver pivotal plot pieces visually."
Premature,Premature is one of the year's best films.
Premature,"A tender ballad-not just about love but age, opportunity, timing-that gets stuck in your head."
Premature,"It's difficult, it's scary, and it's heartbreaking at times. That's what Howard's beautiful performance conveys."
Premature,It's a compelling concept for a coming-of-age story.
Premature,"Authentically raw - almost to the point where it was painful to watch certain scenes in the film, Green does not ease his audience into Ayanna's world."
Premature,A small but stirring coming-of-ager with a knockout lead turn.
Cane River,"Cane River offers American indie cinema a hero worth remembering, and a romantic with a vision beyond his years."
Cane River,"Jenkins' one and only feature weaves living history, charged and messy, into a homespun, hopeful tale. It's impossible not to wonder what he might have done next."
Cane River,"""Cane River"" invites a rethinking of American film history, and also, in its disarmingly offhand, uniquely charming manner - of other aspects of American history as well."
Cane River,"A vivid portrait of small-town, working-class African-American life."
Cane River,The film's awkwardness is expressive of the pain and confusion of wrestling with truths that shake one's conception of identity.
Cane River,"Jenkins's spare, frank lyricism foregrounds the couple's tense discussions about the traumas of history, the weight of cultural memory, and the pressure of racial injustice; he lends the intimate tale a vast and vital resonance."
Titanic,ERROR
Sorry We Missed You,"Loach's film does the work of putting their theories into practice, showing how policy decisions made in isolation ripple out into tragedy once they're enacted."
Sorry We Missed You,"""Sorry We Missed You"" depicts the vise into which many people are forced to put head, hearts, and lives in order to pay the rent and feed their families."
Sorry We Missed You,"This absorbing and ultimately shattering portrayal of the costs of a late-capitalist system obsessed with convenience, efficiency and nanosecond precision couldn't be more timely."
Sorry We Missed You,"As you might be able to discern, this is not an easy film, but it is a brilliant film, and one that encompasses an aspect of the contemporary world with both grace and fisticuffs."
Sorry We Missed You,"Loach, working with a script by Paul Laverty, follows the dramatic principle of Murphy's Law, piling an agonizing litany of undeserved misfortunes on characters left blank."
Sorry We Missed You,The genius of Loach and Laverty's work is that it's heartbreakingly real but never preachy or pedantic. If I had to sum the film up I would choose another adjective instead: devastating.
Sorry We Missed You,"A lacerating social drama that proceeds to demolish the current corporate line on ""gig work."""
Sorry We Missed You,"In their domestic gut-punch of a story, they've exposed our new feudalism in a way that feels honest and blisteringly human."
Sorry We Missed You,What makes it one of Loach's best isn't just its rage (which is plentiful) but its compassion (which is overwhelming).
Sorry We Missed You,"The movie's title, taken from the slip used to denote an attempted delivery, takes on a much more caustic, bitter resonance long before the credits roll."
Sorry We Missed You,"This is a Loach movie, and along with being one of Earth's most venerable and venerated directors, he's almost without peer as a filmmaker formidably committed to exposing the sins of our wages."
Sorry We Missed You,Beautifully performed with searing honesty and naturalism by the entire cast.
Sorry We Missed You,Each of the four main characters are perfectly developed by talented actors who delve deep into their psyches.
Sorry We Missed You,It's difficult to imagine a more socially engaged or powerful condemnation of the exploitative gig economy than Ken Loach's latest.
Sorry We Missed You,"Sorry We Missed You explores the toll of a capitalist society, and the ensemble's thoughtful performances drive home the increasing displacement of our global working class."
Sorry We Missed You,"Filmmaker Ken Loach takes aim at the gig economy and healthcare system with Sorry We Missed You, a humanist take on the crushing weight of capitalism on the working class."
Sorry We Missed You,"Like many of Loach's films, Sorry We Missed You is stark and spare. He doesn't rely on visual flourishes, instead putting the onus on the power behind the performances and the story."
Sorry We Missed You,"Loach in this mode is frankly a ""message"" director and there are all the usual things to be said against such an approach: that his characters are counters first and people second, and that he rigs the game. But he does all this on a high level."
Sorry We Missed You,Surely among Loach and Laverty's most sinewy efforts.
Sorry We Missed You,"The passion, the fluid film-making and the consistency of the acting more than compensate for the expected clunks."
Sorry We Missed You,"Loach, clearly still buzzing from the success of I, Daniel Blake, is having the time of his life. Don't miss this. You'll be sorry if you do."
Sorry We Missed You,We believe in these characters and the situations in which they find themselves.
Sorry We Missed You,"Loach is fiercer, more uncompromising, than ever."
Sorry We Missed You,"It's rarely said about salt-of-the-earth characters that their strongest component is usually sugar. Even so, the screenwriter Paul Laverty, a long-time collaborator of [Ken] Loach's, has found nuance and wiggle-room."
Sorry We Missed You,"Ryan gives a glow, texture and depth to people's faces that are almost Bergmanesque. His work is compassionate even when unsparing."
Sorry We Missed You,At times the polemic overpowers the authenticity of the drama but the wonderfully unaffected performances largely save the day.
Sorry We Missed You,"Though relentless at times, this is a crucial, empathetic rally cry of a film that holds a mirror up to the swelling crisis of the gig economy with admirable intention."
Sorry We Missed You,"Sorry We Missed You is marked by a determined vision to reveal the abuses, exploitations and humiliations rife in the contemporary British labor market for those who struggle to survive on its outskirts, and he does so with immense compassion"
Sorry We Missed You,"Bleak even by Loach's no-guff standards, but it kicks like a mule."
Sorry We Missed You,"As a stripped-down, minutely detailed portrait of the daily grind as back-breaking Sisyphean ordeal, ""Sorry We Missed You"" is engrossing and bluntly persuasive."
Sorry We Missed You,The film's tragedy is that no amount of love and goodwill can save us when the cards are so horribly stacked against us.
Sorry We Missed You,Sorry We Missed You captures brilliantly the alienation and existential anguish that its main characters feel.
Sorry We Missed You,"This new Ken Loach movie teeters on the brink of agenda overkill, but is consistently saved by a revelatory performance from the newcomer Debbie Honeywood."
Sorry We Missed You,"Sorry to Miss You doesn't break new ground for the filmmaker, but it radiates a timeliness that suggests an old-fashioned Ken Loach lament matters more than ever."
Sorry We Missed You,"When your lone goal is to violently stir the conscience of a captive audience, a sledgehammer will do just fine."
Sorry We Missed You,"Its focus is too shallow, its mode of storytelling too blunt-edged and soapy, to have the desired impact."
Sorry We Missed You,"Yes, Loach is didactic, yet you have to admire his undimmed passion and tireless dedication to the cause."
Sorry We Missed You,"It's fierce, open and angry, unironised and unadorned, about a vital contemporary issue whose implications you somehow don't hear on the news."
Sorry We Missed You,Sorry We Missed You finds Loach at his most insightful and clear-eyed.
Sorry We Missed You,"Loach has now done it again. His new film, ""Sorry We Missed You,"" is another intimate and powerful drama about what's going on in people's everyday lives - not just in England, but all over the world."
Sorry We Missed You,A drama of such searing human empathy and quotidian heartbreak that its powerful climactic scenes actually impede your breathing.
Embattled,"Embattled may be smarter than it looks, but it's still further evidence of the decline of human civilisation."
Embattled,"Part classic montage-showdown sports movie, part southern gothic Oedipal family drama, this decidedly peculiar but oddly compelling film is the proverbial curate's egg."
Embattled,"Sarkisov and screenwriter David McKenna (""American History X) give us fully drawn, realistic male characters slugging it out in a battle of male toxicity."
Embattled,"The father-son drama in Embattled might win some rounds, but the abundance of clichés leads to a loss overall."
Embattled,"Much like Dorff's overbearing Cash, the film is easier to take when it's not in your face."
Embattled,"An MMA drama with heart, conviction and a killer right hand jab, ""Embattled"" is a different kind of fighter story, one where the consequences of the fight are more important than the win-loss records of its fighters."
Embattled,"In ""Embattled,"" the human side feels explored, as if the film could have been made without the MMA scenes and still been a worthwhile watch. But it does have those adrenaline-injecting fights, so ... all the better."
Embattled,"A testosterone substitute in drama form, ""Embattled"" practically peacocks onto the screen."
Embattled,"It's gripping in the moment, and gives you a clear rooting interest, thanks in no small part to Mann."
Embattled,The film muddies its sense of moral righteousness by suggesting that violence and vengeance can only be defeated by more of the same.
Honey Boy,"Sometimes painful to watch, but it is also a moving depiction of a man's struggles to understand and perhaps forgive."
Honey Boy,The movie feels very raw. LaBeouf's voice is very unfiltered through this movie... You can tell that he's working through things as he writes the movie.
Honey Boy,"...a very personal and painful statement from LaBeouf and it's to Har'el's credit that she gives it some context and focus, as well as extracting wonderful performances from all the actors..."
Honey Boy,"Honey Boy, despite its heavy subject, is a deeply empathetic and generous drama that strikes at the heart of complex parent-child relationships and inherited trauma."
Honey Boy,A movie that could easily have crashed and burned. That it does not has something to do with the shared intensity of character and performance. All three main actors share the stage as equals and the level of commitment is remarkable.
Honey Boy,It works as therapy. It works as an acting showcase. But the dips and flips we demand from narrative art are missing throughout.
Honey Boy,It has a lightness of touch and an honesty of tone in it. Honestly it's quite impressive...very well directed.
Honey Boy,"Playing out mainly in the skid-row motel in Los Angeles where father and son live, Alma Har'el's dreamlike film leavens the grimness with humanity and humour..."
Honey Boy,"Written by Shia LaBeouf, and based on his own early life, this open-sore autobiography feels like the missing piece in the puzzle of this frequently brilliant, invariably self-jeopardising actor."
Honey Boy,This is bleak stuff. But it's also hellishly entertaining.
Honey Boy,The film delicately bears its scars and finds peace by acknowledging how childhood pains can make and break us.
Honey Boy,"This looks on paper like a self-aggrandising vanity project, but it is very well directed and performed."
Honey Boy,The icing on the cake of [LaBeouf's] indie redemption phase.
Honey Boy,"As actor, scriptwriter and self-portraitist, LaBeouf sets his ducks in a row and takes perfect aim."
Honey Boy,As candid an exploration of stardom as they come.
Honey Boy,"The script is compellingly raw, coruscatingly emotional, darkly humorous and edgily tender."
Honey Boy,"Somewhere between a primal scream, a self-acceptance and even a forgiveness of sorts, this is an utterly unique bit of autobiography."
Honey Boy,LaBeouf's script crackles with penetrating dialogue. His acting - LaBeouf portrays a version of his own father - might be the finest of his career.
Honey Boy,Director Alma Har'el brings this cherry bomb to the screen with a delicate touch that is handled with the sort of compassion that was clearly lacking in LaBeouf's upbringing.
Honey Boy,"Thanks to Har'el's assertively meditative direction and LaBeouf's profound, emotionally-modulated script Honey Boy is a dramatic tour de force."
Honey Boy,"Either as public relations or as therapy, it looks like a dodge. But as art, ""Honey Boy"" is kind of brilliant."
Honey Boy,Honey Boy is a fascinating psychological deep dive.
Honey Boy,"When it comes to cinema as therapy, LeBeouf put his time (and ours) to superb use here."
Honey Boy,"[Shia LaBeouf] delivers a captivating, haunting, and brutally honest exploration of a life we think we know makes it unmissable."
Honey Boy,"The direction by the Israeli filmmaker Alma Har'el goes a long way to making ""Honey Boy"" watchable, bearable, relatable. Poetic, even."
Honey Boy,"Written by LeBeouf and directed by documentary filmmaker Alma Ha'rel, ""Honey Boy"" is catharsis as compelling character study."
Honey Boy,LaBeouf plays James with a psychodramatic intensity that's nonetheless methodical.
Honey Boy,"""Honey Boy"" is more than LaBeouf's bounce-back film. It's an explanation. It's part of his 12-step process. It's a cathartic release of anger."
Honey Boy,"In this intense, unsettling, modestly triumphant portrait of the artist as a young man, LaBeouf shows us not only how he grew up, but what it cost him along the way."
Honey Boy,"I don't know about you, but this is not what I go to the movies for. Color it despicable."
Honey Boy,LaBeouf is so revelatory as both writer and actor that the film defies cynicism about its second purpose as celebrity image management. It just makes you excited about the work.
Honey Boy,Say what you will about Shia LaBeouf -- that kid can act.
Honey Boy,This film just feels really powerful... Raw and gorgeous.
Honey Boy,"Honey Boy adds to the impression that LaBeouf is moving into very interesting territory as an actor, territory uniquely his own."
Honey Boy,"Har'el and Braier bring a gnarly shimmer to poolside dreams and roadside pipe-dreams. Along with LaBeouf, they bequeath the roughest characters with the tenderest mercies."
Honey Boy,"Buoyed by sensitive and ferocious ensemble turns, ""Honey Boy"" is a cinematic salve for a tortured soul, in many regards a powerful vehicle for its star-screenwriter-subject and a vibrant narrative debut for documentary and video artist Har'el."
Honey Boy,Har'el... continues the use of surreal imagery that made her documentaries so striking and emotionally resonant.
Honey Boy,"The film is not a product of vanity, though, or of self-helping self-absorption that shuts others out. It is a powerful, tough-minded entertainment that welcomes us in and tells us a story we haven't seen before."
Honey Boy,"In a dazzling high-wire act as actor and screenwriter, LaBeouf lets loose on his own life as a child star and his relationship with his loose-cannon dad, a role he plays himself in a live-wire performance that jumps off the screen.."
Honey Boy,"In Alma Har'el's film, Shia LeBeouf mines his own life-and reminds us how gifted an actor he is."
Honey Boy,[A] project that sounds like it should be an act of celebrity indulgence but that instead turns out to be one of startling poignancy.
Honey Boy,"The bad outweighs the good here, but perhaps thanks to LaBeouf's performance, or the writing, you can't help but grasp at any string of hope dangled - like any abusive relationship, really."
Honey Boy,"One could watch ""Honey Boy"" musing that it must be nice to have someone finance a movie of your 12-step qualification. That assessment is actually too generous."
Honey Boy,"Even within the context of this upbringing-as-horror-show, LaBeouf locates crystalline reflections of the better man his father might have been."
Honey Boy,"You'll never look at Shia LaBeouf the same way after seeing ""Honey Boy,"" the affecting movie that's inspired by his own life."
Honey Boy,It's probably not the movie you're expecting. It's better.
Honey Boy,Well-intentioned project. Iffy results at best.
Honey Boy,Honey Boy is boldly humane and deeply heart-wrenching.
Honey Boy,"In Alma Har'el's film, Shia LaBeouf's plays an avatar of his father as an expressionistic act of self-therapy."
Honey Boy,"The director Alma Har'el does play with time and reality throughout but there remains a genuine heart to LaBeouf's script, the clear-eyed work of a man at pains trying to figure out how delving into his past might help fix his present."
Honey Boy,"Weaving together two separate timelines, filmmaker Alma Har'el (of the arty documentaries Bombay Beach and LoveTrue) gives LaBeouf's vulnerable exercise a purposely unruly shape, mapping the chaos of addiction with guts and style"
Honey Boy,Honey Boy an example of the therapy art offers within the confines of the screen.
Honey Boy,"It's riveting drama, always existing as a personal, meta piece for a man openly and artistically dealing with his past."
Honey Boy,"The script, written by LaBeouf, is refreshingly direct, and at times, wrenchingly personal, anchored by vulnerable old-soul Jupe, who gives one of the most moving child performances I've seen in years."
Honey Boy,"Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) plays the younger Otis, and he is the single best reason to seek out Honey Boy."
Honey Boy,"The vulnerability, and indeed, the sincerity on display in LaBeouf's screenplay is genuinely moving."
Honey Boy,Honey Boy -- with its winks at Transformers and sitcom conventions -- knows why we're watching and maybe that's enough.
Honey Boy,"Alma Har'els direction is familiar - for recent indie fare, anyway - but sensitive."
Honey Boy,"As a glorified form of drama therapy, Honey Boy is fascinating."
Honey Boy,"If Honey's arc feels stamped in an certain kind of indie template, it still builds a sneaky kind of emotional capital."
Honey Boy,"In many ways [it] resembles other films about chaotic childhoods, alcoholism, and abuse. It distinguishes itself in the manner it weaves the concerns of an actor into that trauma."
Honey Boy,"It's best appreciated less as movie than cinematic confessional, a quest for catharsis in the only substantial medium within his grasp."
Honey Boy,"A sensitive, sincere portrait of a child actor's dysfunctional upbringing and its devastating fallout."
Honey Boy,"[A] searingly personal, self-immolating childhood memoir..."
Honey Boy,"There's a specificity to the proceedings, unfurling like a film written by someone who's spent three decades trying better to understand his father and, in turn, himself. LaBeouf's recreation is nothing short of miraculous."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"For his fourth feature, Australia's prodigal son has returned to his visceral, lo-fi roots."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"How True History of the Kelly Gang broadens what we mean when we say the word ""outlaw"" is another step forward for Justin Kurzel in his cinematic investigation of what makes a man."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"Those who enjoy gritty, angry Westerns (especially those set in the Australian bush rather than along the American frontier) will find much here to their taste, none of which is in need of additional seasoning."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,Kurzel favors stylized images and the occasional anachronistic metal track to provoke a mood more than faithfully recreate history. And his approach works well in this film...
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"Scene to scene I found it riveting, but that said, by the end of it I felt like it added up to less than the sum of its parts."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,There's a texture and a muck that are so tangible that they really put you in the middle of this film. You can taste it and you can smell it.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"That unhinged, hallucinatory spirit is what Kurzel taps into visually... realism clashing with fantasy to the point where the landscape feels more Mordor than the bush outside Melbourne... It's a lot. A little too much for me."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"This is myth-making, splattered in blood, scored with an electric guitar, and enacted with such brazen bigness that you wouldn't be surprised if the cast assembled for a curtain call at the end."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"But for all its real visual flair, it's hard not to feel that the film misses something crucial about Kelly in the end - trading machismo for manhood, and sensation for true history."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"Kurzel's film doesn't simply show us the shattered masculinity and class rage that fueled Kelly's infamous late 19th-century crime spree, it shoots that energy outward like sparks from a forge."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"""True History of the Kelly Gang,"" for its part, strikes just the right balance of scary and crazy, and it subjects both to an impressive measure of discipline."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,Mick Jagger and Heath Ledger have previously played Australia's 19th-century Robin Hood. But George MacKay tops them in this punk-rock take from Justin Kurzel that blows the dust off history to create something thrillingly transgressive.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,The movie's biggest surprise remains that it lacks any.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"[Kurzel] wants this ""true history"" to be a Rorschach blot of Australia's national psychology, but he's made something closer to splatter art instead."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,Grant and Kurzel's conceptions of the characters are so one-dimensional they seem to defeat the movie's talented cast.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"A tale of bodies and brutality, and of skin slick with blood spatter... It's a story of nature versus nurture, of a boy who is forced to be a man, and a man who just wants to be a boy, and the crashing, crushing inevitability of his grisly destiny."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"""True History of the Kelly Gang"" may not be history as recorded by historians. But it's history as recorded by a director with verve and vision."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"In more than one sense, Justin Kurzel's aggressively strange film queers the myth of the oft-lionized Ned Kelly."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,What Kelly Gang lacks in historical accuracy it makes up for with brash punk energy.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,MacKay's Kelly is as memorable as Montana. And that's no lie.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"With its striking imagery and a soundtrack of quivering strings, gargled screaming and slow drumbeats, it's another bold, violent, critically divisive effort from director Justin Kurze."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"[A] stylish, intensely guttural and testosterone-soaked adaptation of Peter Carey's Booker prizewinning novel that, at its most affecting and disturbing, unfolds as a primal cinematic scream."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"The 19th-century Australian outlaw Ned Kelly is given a rock'n'roll makeover in Justin Kurzel's swaggering, defiantly ahistorical drama."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,Kurzel hits form again with a careering drama that harks back to bleary cinematic experiments of the early 1970s.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"Director Justin Kurzel... here returns to what he does best: sparse, violent and hallucinatory visions of mankind's unchecked rage."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"The film is as good as its word, this version of the Kelly legend based on the Booker Prize-winning novel by Peter Carey."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,This is a film which... mistakes flamboyant posturing and raw physicality for authentic performance.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"A compelling, grubby outback Western revealing the ragged reality behind a folk hero. Terrific performances, incredible visuals, and a reassertion of Justin Kurzel as a bold filmmaker most comfortable dealing with discomfort."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"The climax is a punky, Peckinpah-lite splurge that jettisons the emotion and power in a hail of lead."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,The result less resembles a conventional period piece than Kubrick's Barry Lyndon with its fingers jammed in the plug socket.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"It may have been possible to adapt Carey's florid book for the screen, but Kurzel fails to bring the basics. He goes straight for the flourishes, neglecting character, plot and dramatic build-up. The film is all surface."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,Kurzel knows how to bring out the humanity in even the cruelest of characters.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"True History of the Kelly Gang issues a sharp bolt of electricity directly into the heart of this well-worn legend, granting it an intoxicating energy that speaks well beyond the hackneyed 'wild colonial boys' clichés of yore."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"A bold, violent take on the 19th-century Australian outlaw Ned Kelly, a monumental tour through what one character calls ""dirt and disappointment."""
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"It's gritty and grimy, but surprisingly funny too, and cinematography superstar Ari Wegner does an excellent job in providing a real sense of the unforgiving landscape."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"The problem of parsing Ned Kelly's story is at the centre of this film. To watch it, you have to brace for impact."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,A shallow endeavor.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,MacKay lacks the electrifying menace or combustible bravado of his costars...so this story of an outlaw that outraged and inspired never really comes alive.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,An immersive inquiry into how much truth even matters when parsing the lasting impact of a legend.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,True History Of The Kelly Gang (Grade: B) turns out to be an at-once straightforward and intriguingly unintuitive take on the life of the famous bushranger and Australian folk hero.
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"While the emotional intensity and somewhat protracted narrative can be exhausting, in visual terms the film is a tour de force, steeped in blood, dust and squalor."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"A raw rebel yell of a movie that combines visceral violence with a kind of delirious, scrappy poetry."
True History Of The Kelly Gang,"Lithe and volatile and recklessly stylized to the hilt, ""True History of the Kelly Gang"" has moves like Jagger, but a head still teeming with language and history."
Juvenile Delinquents,"On reflecting as to why the film didn't take me, I was drawn to the fact that I just didn't really care, certainly, nothing as strong as pathos was drawn from me, for any of the individual characters, nor for their plight."
His Only Son,The film faithfully tells Abraham’s story along with a very Christian ending and top-notch indie storytelling.
His Only Son,"His Only Son is a worthy, low-budget drama about religious figure Abraham, when he was called by God to make his greatest sacrifice: the life of his son. The depiction of Abraham's troubled marriage gives this reverent movie some grit."
His Only Son,"While the movie tries to demonstrate how obedience and faith will lead to blessings through Abraham's willingness to trust in God, it doesn't go deeply enough into why Abraham has this faith and belief."
His Only Son,I appreciate His Only Son doesn't shy away from the troubling aspects of the story
His Only Son,His Only Son examines mankind's relationship to God and practically demands that the viewer turn inward to ask ourselves how we would respond to such a command.
His Only Son,"A good presentation of the Abraham/Isaac bible story, perfectly timed for the Easter crowd."
His Only Son,"An exhilarating, poignant and mesmerizing journey with just the right balance of Truth and Spectacle."
His Only Son,Abraham’s story is told with conviction and sincerity.
His Only Son,"Despite the movie’s limitations, the journey with Abraham might be worth taking."
The Whale,Charlie [is] played brilliantly by Brendan Fraser...
The Whale,"There’s nothing consciously sinister about THE WHALE’s use of Charlie’s eating disorder (the original play was, in fact, written from experience), but Aronofsky’s adaptation is cruel, not just to Charlie’s character, but to all of them."
The Whale,It’s such a heavy-handed approach that The Whale’s extremity risks alienating the audience from the intention.
The Whale,Its redeeming strength [is] the authentically knotty characters and the performances that inhabit them.
The Whale,"The Whale is a moving, enveloping film that, while it very rarely departs from its stage origins, reaches the heights of emotional drama."
The Whale,"The pace is so repetitive, and Charlie’s small cast of visitors keep bursting through the front door so regularly, that his sitting room comes to resemble a bus depot at peak hour."
The Whale,"Ultimately, it alludes to things without adding up to much of anything. Still, the performances are all excellent, and Fraser is especially compelling, bringing a sincerity to Charlie, and an openness and gentleness."
The Whale,The film needs empathy for Charlie to have a genuine reason for being. But Aronofsky sees his characters the way certain children look at spiders. Which leg first?
The Whale,"Deals in the worst, most jaded conventions of bourgeois middlebrow dinner theatre from the 1950s ... Not even someone so warm as Fraser can win us over to the most jaw-droppingly daft final shot in recent cinema."
The Whale,"The Whale is best appreciated as a moving, stripped-back character study, with a stunning lead performance."
The Whale,"Brendan Fraser, cherished for his earlier roles as an endearing naïve, performs miracles in making Charlie likeable... Enduring such an awful play is a high price to pay to see some acting, though."
The Whale,It's an amazing film.
The Whale,Fraser delivers the best work of his career.
The Whale,"Fraser's choices are so subtly intelligent that we barely notice what amounts to his costume, so attuned are we to the way his Charlie teeters on the brink of life and death."
The Whale,"The Whale is not a cruel spectacle – it is just a dull, repetitive one."
The Whale,"Aronofsky has proven he can direct, so what to make of the fact that this film is so hateful and vile?"
The Whale,"The Whale is messy and compromised, but finds its honesty in the emotional core of its lead performance. See it for Fraser, try and drown out the rest."
The Whale,"A murky-looking, claustrophobic exercise in emotionalism at its most trite and ostentatiously maudlin."
The Whale,"A searing, moving experience."
The Whale,"In every scene, every moment, practically, Fraser strives for and often succeeds in finding something more than cheap pathos."
The Whale,"Most of the conflicts in The Whale are overcooked nonsense, contrived for dramatic impact but divorced from any recognizable reality."
The Whale,It features one great and a couple of really good performances. But it is not a great movie. I’m not even sure it’s much of a good one.
The Whale,What appeared to be a well-meaning film has ended up as part of a long line of art about fat people that ends up trafficking in the same tropes around representing fat people. The Whale is a movie that doesn’t know when it should have flinched.
The Whale,"The script is absolute drivel, a patently phony work that betrays its roots as a stage play at every turn."
The Whale,“The Whale” doesn’t make a lunge for your emotions. It earns them.
The Whale,"Stagy and sometimes overwrought, but it really is a heartbreaking, emotional journey."
The Whale,Two hours of contrived miserablism posturing as an exercise in radical empathy.
The Whale,"I am not opposed to body horror, but the genre is best suited to vulgar ends. The Whale is presenting itself as something noble and, ultimately, uplifting, but it just can’t make that sale."
The Whale,"The movie might largely be remembered for being somber, an emotion that stays at the forefront of the narrative, but it’s optimism that buoys its ending."
The Whale,"Fraser deserves praise for his buried-under-makeup performance, but that’s not enough to keep the movie afloat."
The Whale,"Whatever 'The Whale's many imperfections, Brendan Fraser's relentless display of craft and courage is a must see."
The Whale,"This chamber piece amounts to a variation of torture porn for highbrows, with a fat suit rather than a meat cleaver as the bringer of cinematic shock."
The Whale,"For every sunbeam of humanity Fraser lets shine through this soul, the film summons a half-dozen dark clouds to try and dampen it."
The Whale,"[The Whale] gawks at the grotesquerie of its central figure beneath the guise of sentimentality, but it also offers sharp exchanges between its characters that ring with bracing honesty."
The Whale,Brendan Fraser is on the march to Oscar. That's how astonishing he is as a morbidly obese recluse in this deeply moving character study. Accusations that wearing a fatsuit diminishes his tour de force performances are nonsense. This is essential viewing.
The Whale,"A movie that strives to wrest something raw and truthful from a story that’s all bald contrivances, technological as well as melodramatic."
The Whale,"“The Whale” may not be as honest as Charlie demands, but Fraser is, and that is the film’s saving grace."
The Whale,"This is a film that stays with you and changes you. It is heavy, indeed."
The Whale,"Unfortunately for a film claiming that the body is nothing but a container for the soul, the performance ends up being more surface, less vital spirit."
The Whale,"“The Whale,” like some of Aronofsky’s other projects, is swamped by its grand and vague ambitions. It’s overwrought and also strangely insubstantial."
The Whale,"“The Whale” makes waves in two ways: for Brendan Fraser’s astounding and incredibly compassionate portrayal of an obese man seeking redemption, and as an empathy test in a supremely cynical social-media landscape."
The Whale,The cynic in me believes this movie may have been constructed primarily for end-of-the-year plaudits because there doesn’t seem to be another compelling reason for it to exist.
The Whale,"“The Whale” is laughably earnest, larded with melodrama, and designed to shut down the long-standing association of human bulk with high spirits."
The Whale,[A] peculiar and often deeply unpleasant movie...
The Whale,"The real sin is that Aronofsky only has eyes for Charlie’s flesh and completely fails to notice that Charlie, like all the characters in this movie, is paper thin."
The Whale,"You’ll gaze dumbfounded at the screen for 1h 57m. Pulled into an emotional black hole that offers no easy exit. That’s an incredible, mind-numbing feat."
The Whale,"At times, it feels like you’re watching a stage play, but Fraser’s performance is one for the ages."
The Whale,The Whale unfolds as a series of heavy-handed metaphors in search of realistic dramatic shading. They don’t find it...
The Whale,"Aronofsky, artisan of lost souls, finds compassion in the oddest of situations."
The Whale,"As a story, The Whale is compelling. As a film, The Whale is a tad shakier."
The Whale,"Fraser, so good, takes what could be a joke, a flat tragedy, or even a lecture about weight and imbues it with gorgeous humanity."
The Whale,"There’s precious little truth in Charlie’s Job-like buffet of tribulations, trapping him in a film as stifling as his airless home."
The Whale,"While the body padding transforming Fraser is a stunt, his performance certainly isn’t."
The Whale,Darren Aronofsky’s The Whale is an act of hate disguised as tough love.
The Whale,"With The Whale, Darren Aronofsky brings a hollow sense of dignity to his schematic brand of cinematic misery porn."
The Whale,"It often feels clumsy and maddeningly inconsistent, stranding Fraser in a melodrama undeserving of his lovely, unshowy performance."
The Whale,The Brenaissance is here.
The Whale,The elaborate full-body makeover of The Whale is no less real than anything else in this fatally overwrought melodrama of compulsion and atonement.
The Whale,"The Whale is meant to be a poignant consideration of guilt, sexuality, religion, remorse. We really only know that, though, because the movie shouts it at us."
The Whale,"[The Whale] is stagy and mawkish. Watching it, you feel grossly manipulated but the approach is undeniably effective."
The Whale,"With The Whale, Aronofsky and Fraser have taken substantive risks, in the name of an insistent empathy. I think, and my tear ducts agree, that those risks paid off."
The Whale,"Once everything finally collides in The Whale, something shattering and beautiful and honest emerges."
The Whale,"Body horror takes a new form in Darren Aronofsky’s The Whale, which chronicles the long, slow suicide of a morbidly obese man with pitiless candour but an abundance of empathy."
The Whale,Fraser is courageous and fully committed in his first major leading feature film role for around a decade.
The Whale,"The Whale builds slowly but surely towards that mad coup de grâce, which will either leave you cold or sweep you heavenward: for me, it was a quintessential Aronofsky flourish; as loopily sublime..."
The Whale,A worthy comeback for King Brendan.
The Whale,"Without Brendan Fraser’s innate charm and ability to project gentle sadness through the slightest flicker of his huge blue eyes, “The Whale” wouldn’t have that much else going for it."
The Whale,Hunter’s script and the intimacy of the actors’ work keep the melancholy drama grounded and credible.
The Whale,"Most of “The Whale” simply isn’t as good as Brendan Fraser’s performance. For what he brings off, though, it deserves to be seen."
The Whale,"The writing clunks; the narrative is contrived and unconvincing and the whole film has a strange pass-agg body language, as if it is handling its own painful subject matter with kid gloves and asking us to do the same."
The Whale,"Sometimes an actor can help minimize a director’s shortcomings, and that’s what Fraser does here."
The Whale,"Most of the fatalism comes from a heavy-handed style that sees this closed world as a closed circuit, a place for figurative characters to come and express what they Represent. And then to come back the next day and do it again."
Past Lives,"Past Lives may be a weepie, but it’s a hyper-sophisticated one."
Past Lives,"Plaudits to the principal cast, who do a miraculous job of portraying inner conflict and ecstasy with the merest tilt of a head, or subtle shift of a shoulder."
Past Lives,Song finds the political in the personal and avoids seeming indulgent or niche.
Past Lives,The film’s great magic is the way it captures the beauty of lonely cities with a camera that seems to caress their geography.
Past Lives,It’s barely believable that this is Song’s very first feature. Her film is simply sublime from start to finish.
Past Lives,"It is highly recommended as a touching and always subtle film about old memories, old friendships and contemporary realities."
Past Lives,The performances are impossibly strong and awards-season ready. Anything other than a best actress Oscar nomination for Lee will be criminal.
Past Lives,It is a film that embraces blended nationalities while acknowledging the pull of one’s earliest home. One leaves aware of unavoidable open-endedness but sated by a work that has achieved all its lofty ambitions.
Past Lives,"Past Lives isn’t quite the woozy, lovelorn drama that its trailers have sold... But it is an eloquent attempt to understand how our memories can end up turning other people into projection screens for our own, confused desires."
Past Lives,"That it’s exquisitely affecting and made with great precision and care is enough for now. No need to make a song and dance about it. Indeed, as Past Lives so deftly shows, you can have an excellent drama without any of the drama."
Past Lives,It’s a must-see.
Past Lives,"Past Lives is naggingly unsatisfying: the characters are not fully realised, and nor is their story. The film anticipates an impact it doesn’t earn."
Past Lives,"A transcendent debut for South Korean-Canadian filmmaker Celine Song, this romantic drama is a masterclass in slow, simmering storytelling. It will stay with you, maybe even into your next life."
Past Lives,Past Lives is schematic but effective; what makes it work are the performances by Greta Lee and Teo Yoo as these star-crossed not-quite lovers’ adolescent and adult incarnations.
Past Lives,"Past Lives is quietly powerful – an understated examination of longing, connection, and unconsummated love."
Past Lives,"The tug of Past Lives is situated in the many moments that come together to shape the film into a meaningful whole about love—lost and found, abandoned and claimed."
Past Lives,"Past Lives is lovely—smart, deeply felt, carefully observed, pleasingly patient with its characters and their emotions."
Past Lives,Past Lives is the year’s other great multiverse movie.
Past Lives,"It's a deep, resonant, intimate story which unfolds naturalistically and at a soulful pace."
Past Lives,"In this leisurely, graceful, mesmerizing romance, the magnetic Lee navigates between the past and the present, pragmatism and magical possibilities."
Past Lives,"Past Lives feels so deliciously restrained that it makes even quiet dramas seem histrionic. And yet it’s a wide emotional field that gives its characters room to breathe... if Past Lives isn’t 2023’s best film, we’re in for an incredible year of cinema."
Past Lives,“Past Lives” is a great movie. One that you shouldn’t miss.
Past Lives,"It’s a film full of quiet magic; of the power of words not spoken, and the enduring strength of love."
Past Lives,"A gentle and tender movie about the life we leave behind when we immigrate, and how we embalm those memories in rose-colored hues, told through a relationship filled with longing."
Past Lives,A confident entry in the canon of great romances—one that expands the emotional scope of what a love story can be.
Past Lives,"Song masterfully simplifies things on an emotional level, allowing us to switch back and forth between feelings or simply to meditate on the outcome we wish for, and to understand why it’s OK if we don’t get it."
Past Lives,"[Greta] Lee and [Teo] Yoo are electric together, conveying an excess of feelings both unspoken and not fully understood through their graceful exchange of looks and dialogue."
Past Lives,"Celine Song makes a quietly spectacular writing-directing debut with Past Lives, a lyrical slow burn of a film that expertly holds back wellsprings of emotion, until it unleashes a deluge."
Past Lives,"It’s a rare movie that settles, quietly, into some part of your own experiences and memories without a speck of narrative contrivance gumming up your response to the story on the screen."
Past Lives,"Past Lives treats these very human characters with respect and care, and in turn we care for all of them."
Past Lives,"An achingly beautiful, emotionally subtle and understatedly powerful film."
Past Lives,"At its essence, this is a film for anyone who’s ever known the ache of “the one who got away” and “what-if.”"
Past Lives,"This is a film containing oceans of truth, centuries of longing and vast feelings of open-hearted tenderness."
Past Lives,"Without sacrificing its slender sense of flow, Past Lives is especially astute in articulating all the forces — culture, language, time, fate, love, and connection — that overlap to form the possibilities of her characters’ lives."
Past Lives,There’s a disconcerting shrewdness underneath its patina of tastefulness — it’s too calculating to achieve the transcendent almost-romance it strives for but never inhabits.
Past Lives,"Celine Song’s debut film is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the year."
Past Lives,A movie that liberates your tears and makes you fall in love with it. It is almost assuredly predestined to be the single best movie you see this year.
Past Lives,"Song has said the film is semiautobiographical, and it shows. Although at times technically wayward and dramatically diffuse, there is not a moment in it that does not bear the personal stamp of a lived-in connection."
Past Lives,"It’s so rare to see a movie like Past Lives, one in which every detail is so perfectly defined by writer/director Celine Song."
Past Lives,"The movie ripples with the quiet melodrama of real life, the way big things often happen in the margins, and small things gradually come to mean the world."
Past Lives,"Past Lives, folding two decades into less than two hours, is as swift and fleet as it is emotionally and philosophically expansive."
Past Lives,[Celine] Song’s adroit writing and the hard work of actors Teo Yoo and the steely Greta Lee culminate in an emotional denouement as satisfying as it is devastating.
Past Lives,"Heads up, Oscar. Celine Song crafts the best movie of the year so far by using her own life to explore the meaning of destiny as a Korean playwright (the glorious Greta Lee) is torn between a past love (Teo Yoo) and her American husband (John Magaro)."
Past Lives,"In an electrifyingly alive debut feature, writer/director Celine Song delivers the kind of movie you don't just nestle into but long to revisit. And yes, it's likely one of the very best films of 2023."
Past Lives,"The film hits home. In part, that is a tribute to its melancholy."
Past Lives,Song draws you into her characters’ worlds seamlessly.
Past Lives,A masterclass in storytelling.
Past Lives,"The treatment of time, which is stretched and pulled, crumpled, torn and put back together, makes “Past Lives” a deeply meditative and existentially curious piece."
Past Lives,"A great movie, period."
Past Lives,"If Celine Song’s Past Lives allows men and women to break out of gender expectations, John Trengrove’s Manodrome holds out an olive branch to the kind of alpha men who use the gym as a place of validation."
Past Lives,An effective encapsulation of the complexities of diaspora and multicultural relationships.
Past Lives,"Making an utterly assured feature debut, writer-director Celine Song modulates the delicate tonal balance of this wise, wistful film perfectly."
Past Lives,"Diverging from romances in which lovers are expected to move heaven, earth, and themselves in order to make a moment of love last forever, Past Lives asks us to embrace the changes that come with time."
Past Lives,"Telling a delicate tale about missed connections, what ifs and the parts of ourselves we keep buried within, Past Lives might just be the most singularly exquisite film of this year’s Sundance."
Past Lives,"It’s a minor film in its scope and structure, and yet it feels so very major."
Past Lives,It’s a movie that understands how yearning lives in your body even when you think you’ve set it aside.
Past Lives,"January isn’t usually the time to start making Top 10 lists, but I can already confidently put Past Lives on mine."
Past Lives,"“Past Lives” is based on events in the director’s own life, and it has the quiet impact of home truths."
Past Lives,An exquisite original.
Past Lives,"Past Lives is a miraculous little film from A24, steady and slow and haunted, in the existential sense, by possibilities."
Past Lives,"An exquisitely wistful drama that speaks with an honesty so affectingly crisp it will turn your conceptions of love, identity and fate on their head."
Past Lives,"It is a very tough thing indeed to make a film that is at once restrained and brimming with feeling, a movie that could be fairly described as both big and small."
Past Lives,Few are the films that offer such revelatory conversations between men and women.
Past Lives,[A] delicate yet crushingly beautiful film...
Past Lives,"It’s a beautiful, transporting film but one made with both feet firmly on the ground."
Three Christs,Peddles the sort of heartstring-pulling uplift traditionally reserved for year-end awards hopefuls.
Three Christs,"These are all tremendous, longtime character actors who really get the chance to sink their teeth into this meaty work... [But] it takes a turn from which it never recovers."
Three Christs,"To the extent that [the experiment] was an interesting thing to do, this is an interesting movie."
Three Christs,"The movie may be too understated and inert for its own good, but the actors are uniformly exemplary."
Three Christs,"Three Christs opts in for frustratingly broad characters that feel like half-considered caricatures, while Jeff Russo's sentimental, strings-heavy score flattens whatever modest edge the movie might have had."
Three Christs,"As if it weren't bad enough that ""Three Christs"" were boring, it's impossible to believe, and for that, there is no cure."
Three Christs,"Like the original experiment, this film fails when it tries to impose a conclusion, rather than letting its meaning reveal itself naturally."
Three Christs,"The director, Jon Avnet, who wrote the script with Eric Nazarian, succeeds in keeping the movie watchable in spite of its contrivances."
Three Christs,"Follows a relatively well-tread formula, which is perhaps why it feels so inert. It's a good, relative surface-level reading of events, but the man-on-a-crusade approach feels so much more dramatic than it needs to be."
Three Christs,"Just an odd mess of a movie. That you feel anything at all is a tribute to the acting talent of Dinklage and Goggins, who occasionally make us care."
Three Christs,There's no salvation to be found in this story of a sane man learning about his own limitations from the insane-only suffering.
Three Christs,"By the end, it's as if a good doctor's god complex has been taken up by the film itself."
Three Christs,"Call it Lord, Interrupted or One Flew Over the Crucifix, this is a tedious slog that fails even to hit the emotional marks of the most formulaic nut-house movie."
Play the Flute,ERROR
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"WHITNEY HOUSTON: I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY is like the SparkNotes of [Houston's] life, a smattering of collected moments that feel hollow."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"It is a celebration of her too-short, spectacular career but it does not ignore her drug use, her sexual relationship with Crawford, her tempestuous marriage, and her concert disasters."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"I Wanna Dance with Somebody plays by the rules of the TV movie to efficient, if scarcely groundbreaking, effect. It will change no minds about Whitney Houston."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Instead of utilizing the biopic genre to reveal Houston’s deeper emotionality, experiences, and relationships, the movie often feels as though one is merely watching characters walk through a summary of her major live events"
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,This doggedly formulaic picture struggles to capture even a fraction of the electrifying sparkle of Houston at the peak of her powers.
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Naomi Ackie acts and lip-synchs her heart out as the longbird legend, but Whitney deserved a much better movie than this patchwork, cobbled-together biopic that barely skims the professional highs and personal lows that made up her tragically short life."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"If Whitney Houston fans long to feel her essence again, this movie and its illusions gives them a chance. But not like an extraordinary biofilm. More like a condensed diary with lots of wonderful music."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"I Wanna Dance with Somebody strips Houston of her messy, beautiful humanity. All it offers instead is a product to market."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"A carousel of Whitney Houston’s best bits is brought to life by Ackie, who manages to embody the star’s mannerisms without letting the deified legacy of Houston, or the lacking physical resemblance, swallow her up."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"It manages, even while being unapologetically entertaining, to feel like an honest reckoning with all the things we didn’t want to know about Houston at her fame’s height."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,As generic a musical bio-pic as one is likely to find.
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"The indelible, unmatched voice of Houston may live on, but ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody"" lacks the ingredients of what made Houston a force that permanently altered every person who truly heard her."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,Naomi Ackie seems to channel the pop star in a film that doesn’t dig too deep but consistently entertains.
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"It starts to take on a distinctly ghoulish quality, especially a scene that imagines her frame of mind before her death. It’s a film that ultimately feels less like a celebration and more like further exploitation of the star."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,A quick-hit timeline of Houston's life that adds little new information or insight.
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Ackie feels like she's living Houston, rather than mimicking her. Director Kasi Lemmons' role is more imitative but she does a terrific job of it."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"It’s refreshing that Lemmons focuses on the highs rather than the lows, even if it feels like buffing off the edges of her complex protagonist."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"[Naomi Ackie] does well, catching the contradictions in Houston’s character -- the naivete, the fear of failure, the rebellious streak and its effect on her religious convictions."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Whitney Houston was a singular talent, and she deserves an equally unique motion picture chronicling her life. But this isn’t it, and that’s downright heartbreaking."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"We’ve heard Houston’s rendition of “I Will Always Love You” countless times, and Lemmons bets, correctly, that the beloved hit will still seize us by the heart during the rather forthright montage she pairs with it"
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Whitney may be hailed rather glibly as, per the endless end credits, “the greatest Voice of her generation” [sic], but her accomplishments are divorced of meaning, even in her own life, beyond formidable technique."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Despite the film’s bloated length, we simply never get enough time with one single event to understand how Whitney’s mind worked or why she made certain decisions. There is almost nothing new to learn about her life."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Whitney Houston was, like Elvis Presley, interesting enough by herself, and director Kasi Lemmons does justice to her with a straightforward consideration of her tragic arc."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"If nothing else, the Whitney Houston biopic I Wanna Dance With Somebody is at least festive, bursting as it is with glittery adornments."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,I wanna feel the HEAT … but I don’t.
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,Kasi Lemmons's Whitney Houston biopic strikes the right balance between conveying the joy of the star's music and honoring the truth of her pain.
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Ackie has a light touch, and a convincing handle on every stage of the life she’s depicting."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"A medley of all Houston’s facets off stage without any of them becoming a focus, the movie can’t overcome the impossibility of trying to encompass the entirety of a person in two hours."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"After seeing "" Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance With Somebody,"" it’s clear her story isn’t adaptable for the standard feature film structure."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"You'll probably enjoy it. And even if you don't like everything, you'll probably enjoy arguing with it."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"There are only clichés in this rise-and-fall material, with the sole distinctive wrinkle being the weight given to the rise versus the fall."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,Ackie helps sell Houston as a singular talent even when it’s not her singing those legendary songs at Mt. Everest-level runs of mezzo-soprano notes.
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"I Wanna Dance with Somebody ultimately devolves into a boilerplate biopic, a series of increasingly unfortunate events presented with little narrative shape or texture."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Watching the pop songstress’s life story is like listening to a greatest hits album, with just as little narrative coherence."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Whitney Houston's songs are as catchy as ever, but Kasi Lemmons' film succumbs to familiar music biopic pitfalls without adding much to the singer's legacy."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"It’s gobsmackingly awful, and has no interest whatsoever in tackling the fascinating contradictions at the heart of Houston’s success, especially her status as (from McCarten’s script) “the first black all-American white-friendly girl”."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"In what could have been a definitive tribute to Whitney Houston's career, surface-level execution means her story is not quite done justice. But Naomi Ackie's performance shines above everything else."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"If Austin Butler's Elvis is the king of that crop, [Naomi Ackie's] Whitney is indisputably the queen."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Critics will sniff, as they invariably do, about the familiar conventions of the music biopic. But the spirit of I Wanna Dance With Somebody transcends those conventions far more often than it gets weighed down by them."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"Anthony McCarten wrote this as well as “Bohemian Rhapsody,” a best picture nominee that was anything but, and Houston’s tale ultimately takes the same tack as his Queen biopic: a Wikipedia entry come to middling life on screen."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"The film’s cram-it-all-in approach makes it impossible for “Eve’s Bayou” director Lemmons to assert her usual control, or to anchor even the most tragic moments of Houston’s life with the gravity they deserve."
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,A smoothly watchable and well performed piece of work.
Whitney Houston I Wanna Dan…,"“I Wanna Dance with Somebody” is the kind of lavishly impassioned all-stops-out biopic you either give into or you don’t — and if you do, you may find yourself getting so emotional, baby."
The Godfather: Part III,"The Godfather films have set home-video standards for decades, and that trend continues with Paramounts astonishing 4K restorations."
The Godfather: Part III,Allows us to take in the full scope of Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) tragic journey - from optimistic military veteran to cruel crime boss to emotionally shattered old man.
The Godfather: Part III,[...] a crushing disappointment. It's a sluggish movie with nothing to say about the moral rot of the powerful that the first two parts didn't say much better [...]
The Godfather: Part III,The film is a slow fuse with a big bang -- one that echoes through every family whose own tragedy is an aching for things past and loved ones lost.
The Godfather: Part III,"The movie, a heady thicket of political intrigue and double crosses, is slower, talkier, and more prosaic than the first two films, and its narrative seams sometimes show. And yet it's more than the sum of its mazelike convolutions."
The Godfather: Part III,"The Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity, epic scope, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu."
The Godfather: Part III,"Represents a certain moral improvement over its predecessors by refusing to celebrate and condemn violence and duplicity in the same breath, or at least to the same degree."
The Godfather: Part III,"The acting is merely passable, several characters are given nothing to do, and Michael's paranoid self-pity lends the film an absurd morality: Coppola expects us to sympathise with the semblance of virtue."
The Godfather: Part III,"I think if you can take a step back from the first two movies and if you can ignore the younger Ms. Coppola, this is still a more artful and ambitious movie than the industry standard."
The Godfather: Part III,"Fans of the first two instalments are likely to find The Godfather Part III an unworthy heir to the tradition. First-time voters, meanwhile, will surely wonder what on earth all the fuss was all about."
The Godfather: Part III,"Most film sequels are strictly optional. The Godfather Part III is inevitable, and as such it's irresistible."
The Godfather: Part III,Anyone with memories of The Godfather and its 1974 sequel will shudder at how Coppola reduces their powerful iconography to the level of a daytime soap.
The Godfather: Part III,[An] offer director Francis Ford Coppola should have refused.
The Godfather: Part III,"It may be that Coppola was right to put off filing this last installment all these years; from the evidence here, he had nothing more to say."
The Godfather: Part III,"The Godfather Part III is a good movie, with moments of rare power, but it is not a great one -- a reason why many fans of the series have voiced their disappointment."
The Godfather: Part III,"It is, I suspect, not even possible to understand this film without knowing the first two, and yet, knowing them, Part III works better than it should, evokes the same sense of wasted greatness, of misdirected genius."
Summerland,"There are quite a lot of weird loose ends and a slightly deflationary denouement, but all is forgivable for its earnest sweetness of purpose."
My Brothers’ Crossing,ERROR
The Hill,"Echoes of Norman Rockwell bounce off The Hill, a sincere, inspiring baseball movie grounded in a complicated father-son relationship."
The Hill,"When it's not wrestling (however nicely) with spiritual matters, ""The Hill"" is a well-meaning but dutiful trudge toward an ordained destination."
The Hill,While the movie has its cliches and missteps... that central generational struggle is as old as the Bible (and “The Jazz Singer”) and still dramatically compelling.
The Hill,"While director/screenwriter Jeff Celentano's heart and soul is firmly in the right place, his faith-based drama suffers from being too long and repetitive and sidelines the subject's transition later in life."
The Hill,Corny but uplifting.
The Hill,"It is a cinematic case of confirmation bias, designed to fulfill preexisting values and beliefs."
Percy,"There is an interesting story, and I'm glad to know about it...but other than that it's absolute TV movie-of-the-week stuff."
Percy,"Flawed, yet compelling. And if one is willing to ignore Walken's penchant for pronouncing each word as if he'd never heard it before, there's a lot to enjoy here."
Percy,"Walken keeps you watching thanks to his inherent charisma, still undimmed in his late 70s."
Percy,"Why Johnson or his writers would want to suggest a parallel between their hero and a mafia boss is hard to fathom; perhaps the inspiration came from Walken, betraying a nostalgia for the days when he played more interesting roles."
Percy,"It's a tried-and-true formula, but it comes up sparkling here because Walken's Percy and Maxwell's Louise are such a decent, salt-of-the-earth couple."
Percy,"An involving and inspirational tale, highlighted by a Christopher Walken performance that is remarkably free of any showy tics or mannerisms and is a reminder Walken is a great actor first..."
Percy,"The outstanding cast, handsome visuals, and unimpeachable little guy-against-the-system dramatics carry the film."
Percy,"The result is a movie that's unlikely to raise your pulse, but it might just heighten your interest in what goes into your mouth."
Percy,"The Oscar-winning Mr. Walken gives an affecting, even endearing performance as a simple man with an iron-clad sense of his self-worth."
Percy,"While well cast and plenty compelling (including feisty turns from Christopher Walken and Christina Ricci), this reductive farmer drama deals in emotions more than explanations..."
Percy,"Moralizing and a populist bent are at work, but not out of control. Well, not until the credits roll to the sounds of Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land, anyway."
Percy,"Director Clark Johnson has a cast that's up for the challenge, but other aspects are wobbly."
On the Basis of Sex,Jones is required to repeatedly hold the screen in close-up while bashing out on-the-nose dialogue.
On the Basis of Sex,Director Mimi Leder has an eye for telling detail and a sure sense of pacing...
On the Basis of Sex,"On the Basis of Sex stands, additionally and crucially, as a testament to the power and importance of the legal world's unseen corners."
On the Basis of Sex,"The tight focus makes for an engaging, fast-moving legal drama; as with Spielberg at both his best and worst, this is seldom boring."
On the Basis of Sex,"Taking its cue from Ruth, On the Basis of Sex includes everyone in the equation. Mothers - and fathers! - should take their brainy kids to see it."
On the Basis of Sex,"On the Basis of Sex is well-intentioned, cheesily enjoyable and a little uninspired."
On the Basis of Sex,It's not an entirely terrible film. It's just not the film that RBG deserves.
On the Basis of Sex,It's the right film for now.
On the Basis of Sex,"It's a decent, well-acted drama, if a little blandly dull in its approach."
On the Basis of Sex,Director [Mimi] Leder deserves credit for making a technical and abstruse court case so involving.
On the Basis of Sex,"There was too much riding on Ginsburg's ideals, and her causes, for their treatment to be quite this cute."
On the Basis of Sex,"Solidly and sincerely directed by Mimi Leder, it's a must-see for any mother and daughter, reminding you how incredibly far female equality has leapt and bound within a single lifetime."
On the Basis of Sex,We know or guess the story's outcome even if we are non-Americans. No one today will make a film about a woman failing to make her mark on history. But this tale is well told...
On the Basis of Sex,Subtlety isn't this movie's strong suit and it's often needlessly chary about drawing the parallel between sexism and racism. But it's got a worthwhile story to tell.
On the Basis of Sex,A paint-by-numbers portrait of an American icon.
On the Basis of Sex,"It's not a hugely innovative biopic, covering just a short period of Bader Ginsburg's extraordinary career, but this is still a vastly inspiring account of the fight for equality."
On the Basis of Sex,"You could play a round of biopic-cliché bingo to On the Basis of Sex, but there is plenty to admire here alongside. It's well acted... [And] the ins and outs are dispatched clearly without dumbing down the technical language."
On the Basis of Sex,An inspirational conclusion to a generally gripping movie.
On the Basis of Sex,"On the Basis of Sex is another example of our cultural fascination with Ruth Bader Ginburg's identity and legacy, a film that values her more as a hero than as a person."
On the Basis of Sex,The formulaic film doesn't carry enough heft for consideration as a must-see Oscar contender.
On the Basis of Sex,"As a trailblazing figure, Ruth Bader Ginsburg deserves a knockout biopic about her life. Instead she gets... a serviceable, but by no means extraordinary origin story of a pre-Supreme Court RBG as she begins to shape her legacy."
On the Basis of Sex,"We are invited by the filmmakers to regard Ginsburg as a saint in the making who also happens to be a real person. It's the kind of ""tribute"" that is actually a disservice because it flattens out a complex human being."
On the Basis of Sex,"It's another effort to solidify her sainthood. However, it's also an easily digestible outline of Ginsburg, her career, and why her work is so important. It's a biting piece of herstory that we need right now."
On the Basis of Sex,"A rather broad biopic, but it beautifully argues the importance of Ginsburg's work - prior to the Supreme Court - and is a lovely tribute to the woman who would become the Notorious RBG."
On the Basis of Sex,"Mostly the film, directed by Mimi Leder, takes its cues not from real life but from film clichés."
On the Basis of Sex,"""On the Basis of Sex"" is dutiful Classics Illustrated filmmaking, with the villains easy to spot, the goal distant but obtainable, and an 11th-hour speech that just may save the day."
On the Basis of Sex,"Well-intentioned and occasionally inspirational but mostly flat and safe and cliché-riddled ""origins story"" about Ginsburg's nascent career."
On the Basis of Sex,"Worth seeing, not only as a tribute to the jurist nicknamed ""Notorious RBG"" but for the welcome context that it provides... As a drama, though, the film is just a bit too thin to warrant much more than ending up on the favorable side of a split decision."
On the Basis of Sex,"If it pleases the court, I'd argue that there's one big problem with this honorable attempt to tell us who Ruth Bader Ginsburg is: There's too much material. RBG's life is not a movie; it's a miniseries."
On the Basis of Sex,"For Bader Ginsburg's many devoted fans, this glowing tribute may be just the ticket."
On the Basis of Sex,"As filmmaking, it's clunky, but as fan service, it's more effective."
On the Basis of Sex,"Leder's approach to the story of a genuinely remarkable woman is genuinely, remarkably ... conventional."
On the Basis of Sex,"The film is a magnificent showcase for Jones, the talented actress giving one of the best performances of her career."
On the Basis of Sex,"Call it ""The Notorious RBG: The Early Years"" as a terrific Felicity Jones finds the fire and fury in the young Ruth Bader Ginsburg as she takes on her lifelong battle against gender discrimination."
On the Basis of Sex,On the Basis of Sex is a pretty good movie that has the distinction of being eclipsed by a recent documentary on the same subject. This dramatization was sanctioned by Justice Ginsburg but that endorsement doesn't deliver a fully satisfying film
On the Basis of Sex,"Historical narratives are best when they pique curiosity as well as satisfy it, and this one is too conscientious to proclaim its own comprehensiveness."
On the Basis of Sex,"While the structure occasionally feels a bit awkward, ""On the Basis of Sex"" has the kind of crowd-pleasing story that skims over any minor shortcomings; by its end, you're ready to cheer."
On the Basis of Sex,"It has a serviceable, conventional approach that summarizes the extraordinary achievements of a remarkable woman..."
On the Basis of Sex,"I raise a glass to any movie about her, no matter how they tell her story. Long may she reign."
On the Basis of Sex,"""On the Basis of Sex"" is a serious movie that slowly earns its emotion and enlists our involvement. Even before the finish, it's goosebumps all around."
On the Basis of Sex,"Polished, effective, a bit obvious..."
On the Basis of Sex,On the Basis of Sex falls regrettably flat.
On the Basis of Sex,"A winning, inspirational crowd-pleaser à la Hidden Figures, Leder's film follows the early accomplishments of the young Ginsburg (an assured Felicity Jones, convincingly slipping into the trailblazer's shoes), beginning in 1956."
On the Basis of Sex,"Leder draws lovely performances across the board, bringing clarity and warmth to a complicated but important historical moment."
On the Basis of Sex,The defense concedes that the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic On the Basis of Sex hits its marks with the subtlety of a legal brief. But that's not fatal.
On the Basis of Sex,"Leder... somehow makes a wonky court case about Section 214 of the tax code, which deals with dependent care expenses, into a nail-biting thriller."
On the Basis of Sex,"Mimi Leder's On the Basis of Sex may not break the biopic mold, but it will certainly be inspiring, particularly for young women in the audience."
On the Basis of Sex,Director Mimi Leder has an eye for telling detail and a sure sense of pacing.
On the Basis of Sex,"By joining the Cult of Ruth, it doesn't make the main character into the complex, compelling person she surely is. Here, Ginsburg is just an idea, a symbol - a meme."
On the Basis of Sex,On the Basis of Sex mostly avoids hero-worship in recreating the shameful truth of where the country was a half-century earlier and the importance of Ginsburg in the legal aspect of the shift that continues to this day.
On the Basis of Sex,"Though it goes down easy, On The Basis Of Sex is smarter and subtler than it looks-or, anyway, how its first act makes it look."
On the Basis of Sex,"Unlike its protagonist, On The Basis of Sex won't change the world. But judging by the sobs coming from many of the women around me in the theater, it certainly hits the spot."
On the Basis of Sex,A suitably inspiring biopic despite its narrative unevenness and occasional reliance on schmaltz...
On the Basis of Sex,"Sacrifices character for intricate, and often fascinating, behind-the-scenes legal maneuvers..."
On the Basis of Sex,"Its pace is a little slack, and sometimes it feels too predictably prepackaged. But Jones and Hammer keep the picture moving even through its shakier phases."
On the Basis of Sex,"On the Basis of Sex is too often busy revering Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her confidence and brilliance to bother with presenting her as a living, breathing human being."
On the Basis of Sex,"A movie that floats on an atmosphere of admiration, but also one that solidly appreciates what it is like to be a pioneer for social change."
On the Basis of Sex,"A limited, often idealistic window into Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life but it's one that conveys the significance of singular victories and the cumulative effect that leads to longterm change, and Felicity Jones aces every step of that journey as Ginsburg."
On the Basis of Sex,On the Basis of Sex says we should be emotional. Leder and screenwriter Daniel Stiepleman craft a movie about how passion and intensity are the values of those who change the world.
On the Basis of Sex,"Mimi Leder and Felicity Jones give us an origin story, a romance, an underdog tale, a courtroom drama and social commentary all wrapped up neatly in a smoothly executed, less-than-scintillating crowdpleaser."
On the Basis of Sex,"With few modifications, ""On the Basis of Sex"" could have been made 30 years ago, and its rousing portrait of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg would be a cheesy tearjerker with purpose. Today, it's out of touch."
On the Basis of Sex,"Though the film does play it safe, and falls to a formulaic narrative, the flaws are less within the film itself than in our expectation of what we want it to tell us."
On the Basis of Sex,The conventional connect-the-dots approach and less-than-ideal casting of the leading role keep the film from being something more than a proficient but ordinary account of an extraordinary career.
On the Basis of Sex,"For those not blessed with such courageous figures, Ginsburg's story will be especially inspirational, making it relatively easy to forgive a few manipulative and melodramatic touches in the telling."
On the Basis of Sex,"There's a propelling motion that makes the film a swift, slick watch led by a figure rare in a genre still dominated by men."
Tesla,Almereyda’s wildly creative Nikola Tesla biopic...defies conventions...
Tesla,The biopic is an impossible art. You either bore your audience or reduce your subject to a mere collection of ideas and symbols.
Tesla,It won't spark for everyone but I found it intriguing and unexpected.
Tesla,"To watch Tesla the film is to admire its ambition while regretting its follies. Much like Tesla the man, perhaps?"
Tesla,"It's definitely not for everyone, but I liked this so much more than just a by-the-numbers biopic."
Tesla,"Someone as brilliant and creative as Tesla surely deserves a biopic that is not afraid to be unconventional or to swing for the fences, but in practice this just did not work for me at all."
Tesla,"For all its midway-ness and compromises, ""Tesla"" remains a more audacious and more curiosity-sparking movie than almost all of the bio-pics that come from Hollywood studios."
Tesla,"Almereyda structures the movie as a series of slow-moving scenes, almost tableaux. Even when he uses a mobile camera, things still feel static, but in a good way."
Tesla,"Like its visionary hero, the quirky biopic Tesla is a noble failure."
Tesla,"Often surreal and ambitious, Almereyda's Tesla relegates its subject as a mystery, telling us little beyond the history books; yet as a biopic that rebels against expectations and the need for acceptance, is pitched perfectly to the man."
Tesla,"Those who prefer their bio-pics to unspool like history books chapters may at times be unimpressed by Tesla, which is more interested in applying non-standard cinematic tactics to enliven the facts rather than being enslaved by them."
Tesla,"For all its arch devices and anachronisms, including a wonderfully straight-faced, go-for-broke cover of a 1980s pop hit, the effect of Almereyda's ""Tesla"" is hypnotic."
Tesla,"Tesla is a bit of a mess, but at least it's not another plodding biopic."
Tesla,"Jolts of creative whimsy electrify a delightfully oddball biopic...Amid the anachronisms and fourth-wall breaking, there's a great performance by Ethan Hawke as the futuristic visionary."
Tesla,"""Tesla"" never manages to ground itself, which makes its high wire act feel more like a live wire, sputtering out of control. Stay away."
Tesla,"The film's experimental nature makes it tougher to swallow than a conventional biopic, but also more interesting and rewarding to engage with."
Tesla,A film about electricity and light that never fully illuminates its main character.
Tesla,"Listening closely, I could swear that I heard the whirr of a dynamo inside his cerebellum."
Tesla,"There's an earnest kind of desperation, almost madness, to Hawke's version that feels worth exploring."
Tesla,"Tesla remains wry yet humorless, emotionally shackled while intellectually unbound. Of course our present doesn't shock them, Almereyda posits. They dreamed it into existence."
Tesla,"[A] bizarre, bewitching film."
Tesla,"Tesla is beautiful, bizarre, bold, and brilliant."
Tesla,You might not learn everything there is to know about Tesla - that's what the internet is for - but you will nonetheless feel illuminated by his presence.
Tesla,"Almereyda never quite gets us into the world of Tesla, much less his mind."
Tesla,A frustrating movie of half-measures that hovers between orthodox historical drama and wild experimentalism.
Tesla,"In Michael Almereyda's postmodern biopic of Nicola Tesla, a mesmerizing Ethan Hawke plays the late Serbian inventor who lit the spark for our own wireless world. It's an exhilarating film that roams as free as Tesla's imagination."
Tesla,"While its ideas are often intriguing, the movie feels like high-concept scaffolding that only thinly conceals it hollowness. It's a Tesla without electricity."
Tesla,"A profound sense of restlessness and loneliness haunts Michael Almereyda's film, which reinvigorates the biopic genre."
Tesla,"[Tesla is not] especially memorable, which is too bad, squandering... Ethan Hawke, very intense and brooding as Nikola Tesla."
Tesla,"Tesla proves to be a completely liberated biopic, so much so that it's out of reach."
Tesla,"After all, the film seems to say, when a creative brain has big ideas, cut them some slack."
Tesla,An aptly livewire account of an unknowable outsider whose ideas about a world connected by wireless technology now make him seem like a field-leading visionary.
Tesla,"""Tesla"" doesn't take things to quite the same extreme ... Almereyda's film still kindles Tesla's ever-growing legend in a way that reflects his unique genius."
First Cow,"It is touching, tender, original, entrancing, definitely the best cow film of the year. Plus it's also a quietly masterful thriller where a clafoutis (blueberry) will have you on the edge of your seat."
First Cow,Reichardt works in delicate movements as a storyteller. Magaro and Lee's wonderful chemistry keeps perfectly in step with the filmmaker.
First Cow,Never has a film about two losers and the platonic love they have for each other felt more moving or more engaging. Simply wonderful.
First Cow,"A fable of land and freedom that serves as an up-close-and-personal portrait of friendship and a wider snapshot of America, rooted in the rich soil of the Pacific north-west."
First Cow,"A Western, First Cow is sensual, bleak and meticulously authentic, reminiscent of McCabe & Mrs Miller, as well as Barry Lyndon."
First Cow,"Reichardt, also the co-writer, delivers a patient and earnest parable about environmentalism, American destiny and the value of friendship."
First Cow,"This is a bold, perceptive portrait of early America that deserves to be held up as a new standard of historical filmmaking."
First Cow,"First Cow is archetypal Kelly Reichardt, slow, small and perfectly formed, elevated by stellar but understated performances from John Magaro and Orion Lee."
First Cow,"What it does right, it does wonderfully."
First Cow,"It's a McCabe & Mrs Miller with cows, and there can be no higher praise than that."
First Cow,Watching their friendship crackle into life is one of the film's deepest pleasures. Conversation flows so casually that it feels more sighed than spoken.
First Cow,"It's a wonderfully neat concept, and Reichhart, often labelled a minimalist, has never been more assured as a storyteller."
First Cow,Just don't mistake the lightness of step for a softness of philosophy.
First Cow,"A picture that's both tranquil and dazzling, two qualities that should be at odds with one another yet somehow bloom in tandem under Reichardt's gentle touch."
First Cow,"Some itchy viewers probably (and understandably) won't make it past the first 20 minutes. But if they stay, the deliberate paces of Reichardt's storytelling do cast a sort of spell: a bittersweet comic absurdity, told in the rhythms of real life."
First Cow,"It's a small, understated movie, but it's also one of the best of the year so far."
First Cow,Finds a warm balance between tension and the pleasure of just watching two kindred types find each other and make a life for themselves in a difficult place.
First Cow,"First Cow is overburdened by that preamble, which suffuses the film with a feeling of inevitability but not narrative tension, and the plot isn't sturdy enough to fill two hours. An honorable mention, but no best in show."
First Cow,"""First Cow"" is a wonderfully unhurried film, which may be why it is so captivating. It allows viewers to sink in and absorb the story and its setting."
First Cow,If only every film could achieve the sublime tenderness of First Cow.
First Cow,"I've said this before about Reichardt's films, and for whatever reason I feel the need to say it again. ""First Cow"" will strike some viewers as too little in terms of dramatic machinery. Whatever."
First Cow,"As with Meek's Cutoff, First Cow is a Western that chips away at myth, and wrestles power and history away from the lone-white-cowboy archetype."
First Cow,A small story [that] also inspires awe.
First Cow,First Cow is especially accomplished in its aesthetic...
First Cow,There's an element of parable... Reichardt is critically but not polemically saying something about the nature of capitalism and the so-called American Dream.
First Cow,"""First Cow"" is as confident and organic as storytelling gets - as rough-edged as it is in style, it's absurdly rich in ripple effect."
First Cow,"We might go into a Kelly Reichardt movie thinking we'll be told a story, but we emerge with our consciousness subtly and radically altered."
First Cow,"Think of it more as one of those examples of how you can learn more from fiction than fact, because the movie tells us a lot about the origins of a nascent culture - country, really (ours), and the people within it (us)."
First Cow,"""First Cow"" is the real thing, a genuine work of art. But for too much of its running time, it's agonizingly slow, and the story is almost entirely without suspense."
First Cow,You hold your breath and convince yourself that the inevitable isn't arriving. And all Reichardt offers to comfort you is a remarkable quiet.
First Cow,"A resonant, funny and quite moving shaggy cow story."
First Cow,This haunting movie transports you to another world - and redefines home.
First Cow,It's so many different kinds of movie at once. It has this incredibly rich sense of place and its economic echoes are so relevant today.
First Cow,[Director] Kelly Reichardt is really probing at questions about the American identity and she does that so well in First Cow -- my favorite of her films now.
First Cow,"Reichardt delivers an expertly lush, languid tale about friendship, class, and yes, a very handsome cow..."
First Cow,"Leave it to [Kelly] Reichardt, one of cinema's great excavators... to take what history usually relegates to side-stories, footnotes, or long-forgotten local lore and spin from it a tale that feels fateful and comprehensive."
First Cow,Kelly Reichardt's manifest-destiny epic in D minor...gives you the feeling that you've just witnessed a major work from a great American filmmaker.
First Cow,"It is somehow both brutal and pastoral, peaceful and laced through with the inevitability of disaster and death."
First Cow,"Reichardt has a way of drawing you into her world, where traditional movie tropes have no place and you're not always sure where she's headed. I put my faith in her and more often than not I am rewarded. First Cow is one-of-a-kind."
First Cow,"You'll need to slow your breathing to sync up, or more likely, down with the movie's tempo, but Reichardt rewards your patience with a profound experience that lingers in memory."
First Cow,"Some movies feel dead from the first shot, with or without star power, spectacular vistas or the false energy of hurtling pace. First Cow is vividly alive on arrival and grows into pure enchantment."
First Cow,"The joys of ""First Cow"" are many. The thoughtful, unshowy textures of its clothes and surroundings. The fabulous chemistry of its two leads. The softly stirring guitar of William Tyler's score."
First Cow,First Cow is a magnificent yet modest work of tenderness.
First Cow,"A story about the power of money in a world where money hardly seems useful. The power it accumulates is like a runaway train, snowballing and steamrolling the delicate webs of connection that humans so tentatively spin."
First Cow,"While it fits perfectly into the larger framework of Reichardt's filmography, it also stands alone in rare, iconoclastic beauty."
First Cow,"The deep, lingering ache of ""First Cow"" comes from the realization that, even in a world still in the process of being formed, its cruel divisions have already been carved so deep."
First Cow,"A parable of economics and politics, with shrewd insights into the workings of supply and demand, scarcity and scale and other puzzles of the marketplace, the movie is also keenly attuned to details of history, both human and natural."
First Cow,"Reichardt films the workingmen's friendship and their frustrated strivings sympathetically, and observes with dismay the official's domineering ways and pretentious airs, but she reduces the protagonists to stick figures in a deterministic landscape."
First Cow,It's hard not to view Kelly Reichardt's film as a poetic blueprint for modern America.
First Cow,"Kelly Reichardt gives us a terrifically tough and sinewy tale of the old west, shaped by the brutally implacable market forces of capitalism."
First Cow,"With First Cow, Kelly Reichardt, America's foremost chronicler of small stories rooted in meticulously-crafted geographical expanses, has delivered another slowburn heartbreaker."
First Cow,"[A] stealthy, resonant, and finally riveting tale..."
First Cow,"The sense of a nascent community rising up out of the primordial muck is palpable, so it's unfortunate that John Magaro and Orion Lee's characters ultimately feel outside it all."
First Cow,A hypnotic yet simple extrapolation of the early-American frontier... Reichardt's First Cow [is] as sweet as Cookie's oily cakes.
First Cow,King-Lu and Cookie need each other...and First Cow commiserates with their journey in a kind-hearted fashion that allows the movie to resonate with more warmth than it initially lets on.
First Cow,"While not a lot happens in First Cow by the standards of most two-hour narrative films, and some may wish for a less open-ended conclusion, the drama's rough-edged lyricism kept me rapt the entire time."
First Cow,"Reichardt specializes in pared-down narratives, sometimes stripping away so much that boredom sets in. ""First Cow"" may be lean, but it offers ample room to ruminate in the comparison between its two time periods."
Made in Italy,"There's nothing original here and, despite the real-life parallels, little authenticity."
Made in Italy,"Those in the market for domestic drama, sexual tension and humorous mishaps against a backdrop of sawing and sweeping would be advised to try any home renovation show over this."
Made in Italy,"Realism is clearly not a strong suit for writer-director James D'Arcy, but he gets pretty good comic performances from his likeable cast, which includes Lindsay Duncan as an acerbic estate agent."
Made in Italy,"A treacly slog with a screenplay that fails the storied talent of its elder lead, and the promising gifts of his younger counterpart."
Made in Italy,"Liam Neeson and his real-life son Micheál Richardson bring a personal sense of love and loss to this otherwise mawkish tale of grief and healing, Italian style."
Made in Italy,It's the fabulous convergence of nature and the almost-fabulous convergence of the actors that makes it worth a watch.
Made in Italy,I can only hope this real-life bonding exercise was more satisfying than what appears on screen.
Made in Italy,"For a movie that's supposedly meant to lift us off our couches and set us down in a verdant dreamscape, this limp foreign-soil fantasy from James D'Arcy doesn't come close to getting the job done."
Made in Italy,If it were any less original it'd be its own sequel.
Made in Italy,"With a gorgeous location, pretty people and familiar story, ""Made in Italy"" is too gentle to make an impression."
Made in Italy,"Everything should be better in Tuscany. But in ""Made in Italy"" is a trip to sit out."
Made in Italy,"The film doesn't need to be a dark and brooding heart-wringer, but given the real-life grief that Neeson and Richards undoubtedly brought to it, it's a shame that this trip abroad isn't more memorable."
Made in Italy,The sad subtext of Made in Italy is more intriguing and poignant than what we see on screen.
Made in Italy,"Some movies can get away with just being a scenery sandwich, a few fat slabs of gorgeous vistas with a sliver of plot slipped in between. Made in Italy is that kind of movie."
Made in Italy,"Predictable, affable, and completely guileless, the only part of Made in Italy that distinguishes it as having been made now, rather than any other random point in the last 30 years, is how grizzled Neeson's beard has become."
Made in Italy,Made has the passport; it just doesn't take you there.
Made in Italy,A cringingly syrupy tale of overdue bonding between an estranged father and his only offspring...
Babylon,"Attempts to out-Fellini Fellini are regrettable and for much of its length Babylon is an unsubtle and indigestible mess so that despite all the talent involved and the fascinating subject matter, it must be seen as something of a disaster."
Babylon,Subtle it is not. Nor is it good.
Babylon,"Chazelle’s film commemorates the era’s hubris as it indulges in a bit of its own. This is how a world ends. Not with a whimper but a great deal of banging, baby. And vomiting. And snorting."
Babylon,"Babylon is a disaster of biblical proportions, precisely because it had so much potential."
Babylon,"Babylon is not so much a film of two halves, but a third of a brilliant movie and two hours of unmitigated mess and chaos."
Babylon,"In the end, Chazelle does evoke the elegiac mood he’s after, finishing with a wistful meditation on the evanescence of fame and the fragility of those who fail to survive its demands."
Babylon,"If the running time is a tribute to 1920s excess, Chazelle should have listened harder to his old ghosts. Kid, you’re meant to leave ’em wanting more."
Babylon,"I didn't buy one second of it, for one moment."
Babylon,"I absolutely loved it... What [Damien Chazelle] does that I love is tell the story in such an exaggerated, maniacal fashion that it feels truer than it's ever felt before."
Babylon,"For a director skilled at mounting set-pieces, Chazelle is extraordinarily duff at managing structure on a larger scale: perhaps those talents don’t sit well together. Babylon has spectacular scenes yet is hopelessly unwieldy as a whole."
Babylon,"For all Babylon’s excess, Chazelle’s self-consciously virtuosic style saps the life from even its most overcrowded tableaux."
Babylon,"Under Chazelle’s bruised showman sensibility, to love something means honestly seeing all the ways in which it is broken and still hearing violins when you look at it anyway."
Babylon,One of the year’s richest and most ambitious films.
Babylon,"Chazelle is trying to make a point with all the excess... I’m not sure if I agree or if I was simply beaten into submission after more than three hours, but Babylon is the kind of grandiose folly that at least gives the viewer a big old mess to chew on."
Babylon,"Its panache begins to feel more like the idea of panache -- like a bodysnatcher lurking under a skin of actual cinematic style, all empty gestures and wiry nothingness. The disappointment is that the movie wields so much and achieves so relatively little."
Babylon,"Despite a stellar cast and showy moments (given who’s involved how could there not be?), the writer-director’s sprawling, messy, three-hour-plus endurance test isn’t ready for its closeup."
Babylon,"Babylon is a profoundly humanist film, mourning the tragedies that litter Hollywood histories. But it’s also a worshipful film, one that gladly buys into the dream, the spell, the mystery of it all."
Babylon,"The performances are fun, the music raucous, the costumes glorious. And yet, the entire visual feast of a movie recalls the excessive party scene in Baz Luhrmann's overstuffed The Great Gatsby, beautiful and damned."
Babylon,"It is too much and often, especially in call-outs to ""Singin' In The Rain,"" a little on the nose. It is also clearly heartfelt and that counts."
Babylon,"I didn’t love Babylon but I can’t condemn it either. How could I when its finale is a love letter to movies and the way they can lift our spirits? Any filmmaker who strives for that shouldn’t be dismissed, even if he made us sit still for over three hours"
Babylon,"You can enjoy its garish pageant of sex, drugs, death, and screaming matches while still wondering if Chazelle is cosplaying transgression, trying to will himself into a rock star of American coke-binge cinema."
Babylon,"Damien Chazelle’s Babylon is a classic Hollywood reflection on itself at a pivotal point in its history, chronicling the rise and subsequent fall of a series of characters at different points in the journeys to stardom."
Babylon,"""Babylon"" is exasperating. It tries to do too much but ends up doing not saying very little. Less would have been more."
Babylon,"Self-indulgent, stomach-churning..."
Babylon,"Long and frequently unpleasant, but at least there’s a point to all that decadence and despair: first time as tragedy, second time as hit musical."
Babylon,"Chazelle can’t seem to land on whether or not he wants to reject nostalgia or eulogize cinema, and ultimately, it’s all incredibly smug for a message, and a movie, so muddled."
Babylon,There's about an hour of terrific movie in this love-hate look at lurid Old Hollywood. Too bad it’s trapped in three hours of self-indulgent bloat. Even the starshine of Robbie and Pitt dissipates as Damien Chazelle rabidly bites the hand that feeds him.
Babylon,Will this come to be known as Damien Chazelle’s folly? I hope so.
Babylon,"It goes nowhere, in a mad rush."
Babylon,"""Babylon"" deserves credit for taking big swings, but it's usually unclear what it's swinging at."
Babylon,"“Babylon” is a labor of love that never feels laborious. But as the allusions and inside jokes pile up, they become distracting."
Babylon,"Chazelle whips the story into cream-puff whorls of myths upon myths. He delivers a movie that's neither unified nor disparate but homogenized, its elements of reality and hyperbole alike assimilated to the same creamy glow of rueful wonder."
Babylon,"While the director is a consummate craftsman who stages several staggering scenes of razzle-dazzle, it’s all pugnaciously heartless. To put it even more bluntly: I couldn’t have cared less."
Babylon,"This ambivalence is, in and of itself, a point of interest, since most movies made at Babylon’s budget level are afraid to put any onus of interpretation on the audience. But it’s also risky."
Babylon,"Chazelle can be weirdly inattentive to the overall structure of a movie’s narrative, so that, while never boring, Babylon winds up being exhausting."
Babylon,"An overstuffed and -- especially by the increasingly wayward third act -- meandering film. But it’s also an insistently alive one that’s hard to look away from, with flashes of brilliance."
Babylon,"Throughout this disappointing movie, what’s missing is the one thing that defined the silent era at its greatest and to which Chazelle remains bafflingly oblivious: its art."
Babylon,"Frenetic as Babylon is, Chazelle himself remains clear-eyed."
Babylon,"I admire Chazelle’s ambition. He swings for the fences here -- and he’s obviously an enormously gifted director. But to me, this is a swing and a miss."
Babylon,"You're in for one of the most outlandishly energetic, sinful and ambitious cinematic experiences of this year."
Babylon,"Chazelle does a dazzling job of telling his story, even if for large swaths it's unclear if he's celebrating movie magic or driving a stake through Hollywood's heart. By the end it's clear... he's also a fanboy at heart."
Babylon,Nearly all the main characters get a why-movies-matter monologue. Nearly all are shabbily written.
Babylon,Babylon is a film too busy writing an elegy for the still-breathing body of film as a medium to capture the true beauty and complications of being alive.
Babylon,"“Babylon” may not be Chazelle’s “Heaven’s Gate,” exactly. But it’s definitely the most maddening movie experience you’ll have this year."
Babylon,"After enduring — and I must say, enjoying much of — this wild and pungent cinematic bacchanal, I’m of the mind that they actually form a logical progression."
Babylon,"Babylon thins out all too quickly, settling for a strenuous ode to the dream factory and its victims and exploiters, who occasionally make wondrous things for the screen."
Babylon,Can’t bring the hazy stuff-for-stuff’s-sake into focus.
Babylon,"Babylon is uneven, to be sure, but any missteps are more than compensated for by the exultation derived from the moments of frenetic exuberance that have become Chazelle’s bread-and-butter..."
Babylon,But why opt for subtlety and insight when you can have upchuck and defecation?
Babylon,"A great score, a talented ensemble, and expert cinematography—all undeniable here. And yet there are narrative elements of “Babylon” that feel hollow from the very beginning and only get more so."
Babylon,"Yes, Babylon is, as its title more than hints at, A LOT. And I loved nearly every one of its unbelievable 188 minutes."
Babylon,"At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now."
Babylon,Damien Chazelle film’s direction is breathtaking and jaw-dropping...
Babylon,"[A] lumpen, maudlin, misbegotten opus."
Babylon,"Shimmering, mournful, and riotous, Babylon is one of the year's best movies, thanks in part to a star-making performance by Diego Calva."
Babylon,La La Land on coke.
Babylon,Chazelle is so enamored with his simulacrum of this forgotten world that he loses sight of the people in it.
Babylon,"A daring, formally audacious yet messy ode to cinema from one of the most enterprising filmmakers working today. Bravura and baffling in equal measure. Strap in."
Babylon,"It begins to feel, as Babylon stretches out across three hours and eight minutes, that Chazelle has no clear idea where all of this is going."
Babylon,"Babylon is a ghastly, sticky, indulgent mess of a movie, slinging shock value in lieu of anything interesting to say."
Babylon,"Calva wears a poet’s heart on his sleeve, and beautifully so, while Robbie’s feral performance feels extracted from some higher plane of existence."
Babylon,"Even a full-blown fantasy needs its own eternal logic, a thing Babylon rarely gestures to or simply disregards completely."
Babylon,"I can’t say I truly enjoyed watching “Babylon,” or that I’d ever want to see it again, but I definitely haven’t stopped thinking about it since screening it..."
Babylon,"The film’s propulsive energy is so authoritative that it occasionally threatens to nullify all other elements, but Robbie’s performance is equal to the task and bubbling with awards season kudos."
Babylon,"Chazelle swings for the fences, but Babylon feels like the worst kind of jazz: a loose freestyle comprised of beautiful moments punctuated by bum notes and off-key scatting."
Babylon,"Burdened with the knowledge that this $80 million studio project could be the last of its kind, “Babylon” refracts Hollywood’s first major identity crisis through the prism of its latest one."
Babylon,Babylon exposes it as the bittersweet lie it always was – showing an industry that’s corrupt... but also wily enough to disguise its own chew-’em-up-and-spit-’em-out business model as the very fairy tale that keeps the show on the road.
Babylon,"It’s not the best movie you’ll see this year, but it’s the most movie by a long shot."
Babylon,"It’s always a pleasure to be in the presence of such black-belt movie stars as Pitt and Robbie and there is something funny in Babylon’s wild, event-movie gigantism."
Babylon,"No doubt plenty of cool kids will eagerly sign up to be pummeled by the film’s crazed excesses, though just as many will find it exhausting and sour. Even its technical virtuosity feels assaultive."
Babylon,The film is a down-in-the-muck advert for an ultimately dewy-eyed vision of the silver screen.
Babylon,"Sometimes it’s dazzling, sometimes it’s derivative.Still, there are worse people to spend three hours with than Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie."
Babylon,“Babylon” is what movie love really looks like.
Babylon,"Even with a great turn from Brad Pitt, an impressive showing by newcomer Diego Calva and a bunch of entertaining cameos, the madcap comedy-drama can’t help but run out of creative crazy juice by the end as it unspools into cinematic sentimentality."
Babylon,"Babylon is a manic sprawl that only pretends to celebrate cinema. It’s really about prurience, dumb sensation, self-congratulation and willful ignorance of history."
Babylon,"It just feels like Chazzelle is trying to do Baz Luhrmann — and, even more embarrassingly, he’s failing at it."
Babylon,"A hyped-up cocaine conversation of a movie, throwing out lots of ideas and images and mammoth set pieces without ever amounting to anything."
Hope Gap,The trouble with opening up this story for long walks on the beach? It seems to flatten out with the tide.
Hope Gap,"None of it lacks credibility. As a portrait of the breakup of a marriage, and the three-cornered pain of the situation, it's completely convincing."
Hope Gap,"Diehard fans of Nicholson will probably suck it up. For the rest of us, this is hopeless."
Hope Gap,"The film's biggest failing is that, unfortunately, Bening is terribly miscast here.Her wandering accent - is it Cockney? is it Home Counties? - becomes more jarring the longer we go on."
Hope Gap,"A coastal breath of fresh air, but Bening should ditch the accent."
Hope Gap,"With an acting trio like that you're guaranteed an involving watch but somehow this intense relationship drama fails to cut to the bone. Nicholson adapted this from his own play The Retreat From Moscow, and you can feel it."
Hope Gap,"The performances are terrific, especially from Bening who adds yet another deeply nuanced study to her gallery of complicated, smart women of a certain age."
Hope Gap,Though the cast gamely delivers each idea ... Hope Gap never seems to grasp the crucial differences between theatre and film.
Hope Gap,Your sympathies are deftly toyed with; Nighy jitters and surprises; O'Connor has the sad gravity of the eternal referee.
Hope Gap,A cataclysmic casting decision combined with consistently flabby direction have conspired to transform this low-level divorce drama into a titter-inducing dud.
Hope Gap,"Indelible and infuriating in equal measure, filmmaker William Nicholson's anatomy of his parents' own broken marriage rides high on superb performances from Annette Bening and Bill Nighy and raw emotions that cut deep,"
Hope Gap,"Indeed, the sensation that dogs Hope Gap is that they forgot to roll camera on the most dramatic parts. What's left over isn't bad, only underwhelming."
Hope Gap,"Films about marriages cratering on the craggy shores of deceit and betrayal are as common as oxygen, but one that makes as big an emotional impact as ""Hope Gap"" is a breath of fresh air."
Hope Gap,"""Hope Gap"" is a deeply sad film, and maybe not what a lot of us are in the mood for these days, but it's ultimately uplifting, in its quiet way."
Hope Gap,"Squishy. It felt earnest to the person who made it, but not to me, the person watching it."
Hope Gap,"Hope Gap is pithy, engaging, and insightful-the kind of movie we desperately need more of."
Hope Gap,A drama that's tastefully restrained to a fault in a particularly British manner.
Hope Gap,"To Annette Bening's credit, she finds just the right notes to illustrate Grace's capacity for love, as well as her special gift for never letting up and driving you a little bit crazy."
Hope Gap,"A sort of British Marriage Story for boomers, with only one side, really, of the story to tell."
Hope Gap,"[A]n intelligent and absorbing, if slightly bland domestic drama scripted and directed by William Nicholson, inspired by his own parents' divorce."
Hope Gap,"The film is a waste of Bening's talents: an inoffensive tale inspiring little more than a shrug, thereby making it hard to either wholeheartedly endorse or strongly criticize."
Hope Gap,So many grandiose tactics portend a grander revelation than the film's otherwise low-key three-hander delivers.
Hope Gap,"While you've seen this portrait before, and better, Nighy and Bening are so in tune with their characters that such rote renderings are easily forgiven."
Hope Gap,"Nighy gives a master class in withdrawn, mumbling ineffectualness... while Bening is superb as a retiree whose shock at her disengaged husband inspires a suite of conflicting emotions."
Hope Gap,"Unfortunately for Nicholson, Bening and Nighy aren't enough to fill what's missing."
Hope Gap,"Abrief, sad little piece that doesn't quite hurdle the blood-brain barrier and rattle you to the core, but it does achieve a half-sublimity..."
Hope Gap,Nicholson fails to give his film the specificity and emotional depth required to make it seem necessary.
Hope Gap,Considerably more nuanced and mature than your typical relationship drama...
Hope Gap,"The issue is that there is no subtext or undertones, the suggestion of nuance and complexities."
Hope Gap,"A late-middle-aged divorce saga so dead-set on scrubbing any notion of emotional villainy that it's as thin as a postcard with a view of that presentably beautiful, chalky seaside."
The Chosen Season 3 Finale,Absolutely atrocious. I admire the fact that they did try to propel the story in a different direction. But the story they chose was insanely boring.
The Chosen Season 3 Finale,This movie is a dirty trick on all Halloween fans.
The Chosen Season 3 Finale,"This is one of those Identikit movies, assembled out of familiar parts from other, better movies."
The Chosen Season 3 Finale,Mr. Wallace clearly has a fondness for the cliches he is parodying and he does it with style.
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"... The script gives us the dullest kind of life-story movie: a simplified, unvarying trudge through a checklist of events."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,An excellent movie about a beloved figure who indeed seems ageless and whose story includes the kind of comebacks usually reserved for fiction.
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"It’s solidly and safely directed by George Tillman Jr, but will likely appeal more to the Christian cinema crowd than to the sports movie audience."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"“Big George Foreman” is strong in depicting the outer life of the boxer, but when his conflicts are internal, the movie can’t meet sterner artistic demands."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"An all-too conventional look at an unconventional man, Big George Foreman is, alas, a swing and a miss."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,The film stumbles sluggishly from one chapter in Foreman’s life to the next.
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"Davis is impressive as Foreman, but just as in real life, it is Sullivan Jones as the charming and hubris-fuelled Ali who steals every scene from under him."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,Raging Bull it is not.
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"Eventually, if you like boxing and are willing to accept this as a sanitized and truncated version of the full story, it’s not hard to sit back and enjoy the eventful aspects of the big man’s life and his engaging personality."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"A strong filmmaking team could have made a meal of this story. Unfortunately, Tillman Jr. settles for a lousy boxing movie in service of a sermon."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"It sounds like the title of a biography for young readers, and that’s pretty much how the by-the-numbers film plays."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"The actual arc of the boxer’s career remains fascinating, but a meandering plot filled with heavy-handed metaphors and stale fight scenes renders it damn near unwatchable."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,A movie with its heart in the right place and its sense of drama nowhere in sight.
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"It hits all the expected beats, shows us all of George’s best outfits and highest-profile bouts, but doesn’t dig into anything darker..."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,"It’s prosaic and conventional and a touch stolid, but it stays true to the facts and the spirit of the man (he’s both sinner and saint), and the saga they add up to is singular in the history of sports."
Big George Foreman: The Mir…,A ringside seat to an entertaining spectacle.
Women Talking,"Even though it’s a Spartan approach to filmmaking, Women Talking never fails to slap you awake."
Women Talking,Women Talking is a tough-minded yet sensitive film that could pose a bit of a challenge for some audiences.
Women Talking,"If you can go along with these broad brushstrokes and consequent holes in the plot, you’ll find high drama in Foy and Buckley’s ferociously fine performances, together with moments of wistful poetry..."
Women Talking,"It breaks free of the bleak narratives that have boxed in cinema’s rape victims over and over again. At the very least, it’s something we haven’t seen before."
Women Talking,A tale that is at once timely and timeless.
Women Talking,"It’s heavy material, and it might have sunk the movie had Polley not buoyed it with such a knockout cast."
Women Talking,"Quietly, confidently and without fanfare, Polley has made the first piece of great post-MeToo cinema. What it depicts, and a homogenising hashtag doesn’t, is that there is no singular response to abuse."
Women Talking,"Polley allows bursts of weirdness and humour to punctuate deliberation that, though often abstract, never becomes alienatingly cerebral."
Women Talking,"It is compelling, gripping, powerful, as tense as a thriller. Think of it this way: it’s like Twelve Angry Men, but in this instance it’s Eight Angry Women (in a hayloft)."
Women Talking,"Polley never condescends to us by spelling it out, but the film lands both as timeless and acutely relevant in 2023."
Women Talking,Experiment enters the mainstream to create a new feminist cinema.
Women Talking,"The film’s rather abstract conversation doesn’t convey much in the way of urgency or specificity. But there is a sustained moral seriousness in Polley’s work, a willingness to confront pain."
Women Talking,"A remarkable ensemble of performers unite for this combustible, timely chamber-piece that hails the return of Polley as an ambitious and empirical filmmaker."
Women Talking,"This has the makings of a waiting-game Western such as High Noon or Rio Bravo, as well as hints of Unforgiven... Whatever course of action is taken in Polley’s film, it will be the women who do it."
Women Talking,"The subject matter is powerful, but despite a number of fine performances, Women Talking is never quite able to find its voice."
Women Talking,"Plays like a fable... But it's sharp, and it's biting."
Women Talking,"It's a film with so much depth and, of course, one of the greater casts you'll see this year."
Women Talking,"There is a lot of injustice in the world, ""Women Talking"" admits, but there are small, hopeful things we can do to make it a better place."
Women Talking,“Women Talking” is full of phenomenal acting by a group of actors at the top of their game.
Women Talking,"To some, this may sound like the kind of verbose material more fit for a stage play than a film. But Women Talking, adapted by the writer-director Sarah Polley from Miriam Toews’s 2018 novel, is vibrant cinema."
Women Talking,"Once the viewer accepts its mannered style and bluntly literalistic vernacular, it builds to a kind of unadorned grandeur."
Women Talking,"From the acting to the directing and on to one of the best screenplays of the year, it is a tour-de-force in every sense."
Women Talking,This is Sarah Polley’s first film as a director since the amazing “Stories We Tell” in 2012. Let’s hope another decade doesn’t pass before she makes another.
Women Talking,"“Women Talking” is a powerful, moving tribute to quiet strength — and, unexpectedly, to hope."
Women Talking,"A tepid, dramatically dead treatment of a serious subject."
Women Talking,"It’s to the film’s credit that it never fully devolves into the equivalent of a stage play captured on film. Which, look, when you’re working with a cast like this…."
Women Talking,"Women Talking imagines female emancipation as an honest, raging, caring experience."
Women Talking,Though the movie offers few mysteries—its substance is foregrounded and there isn’t much background—its vision of concerted action in the face of outrage is resonant.
Women Talking,Anyone clear-eyed about the world today will recognize the truths that these women are talking.
Women Talking,"Much has been said about the year’s best films not attracting the audiences they deserve. Women Talking is not what one would call a crowd-pleaser, but it is an extraordinary piece of work that is well worth your time."
Women Talking,"Women Talking asks if you’ll listen. There is, of course, an argument to be made that Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Miriam Toews’s critically acclaimed novel is meant to be more seen than heard."
Women Talking,The women are talking. It would do us well to listen.
Women Talking,"Sarah Polley's trust in the material—and her actors—allows for the performances to flourish, and the performances drive the story along with the barrage of words."
Women Talking,"Insightfully complex, for a film where almost every meaningful minute takes place in the dusty hayloft of a creaky old barn, this is as tense and as suspenseful a thriller as anything I’ve seen in 2022."
Women Talking,It is astute and urgent and may just help those previously unable to find words or even coherent feelings for their own traumatic experiences. And hopefully it might just inspire more works of wild female imagination.
Women Talking,Polley keeps things moving at a good pace as the looming deadline creates tension.
Women Talking,"“Women Talking” compels you to think about their plight, but it also invites you to enjoy their company."
Women Talking,"This empathy translates to the viewer, and by the cathartic ending scenes it’s impossible not to feel real emotion for this fictional community."
Women Talking,"Without offering more than dialogue, Women Talking has difficulty sustaining itself for 104 minutes."
Women Talking,"'Women Talking' is about as direct as cinema gets in portraying the complexities and nuances of the feminist struggle, and it achieves much with characters who wouldn’t likely consider themselves feminist or revolutionary."
Women Talking,One of Women Talking’s best features is its ability to parse out language in a way that points to its intentional violence as well as its capacity – through collective criticism and reflection – to be retooled as a means for self-determination.
Women Talking,So what if it’s talky. Sarah Polley’s vital film gathers together eight women—acted with heat and heart by a miraculous cast—to debate what to do about male sexual predators. Doing nothing is not an option in this unique and unforgettable film landmark.
Women Talking,"As time ticks towards a deadline, audiences will be rivetted and hoping that these emotionally scarred women find the strength and resolve needed to propel them forward."
Women Talking,"Even more incredible, given the subject matter, is that so much of what this group say and do, as they gather in a hayloft, is insouciant and funny."
Women Talking,"Despite a morose colour palette that can feel a little eat-your-vegetables at times, the film is beautifully performed and gripping in a chewy, nuanced, contemplative way..."
Women Talking,"As Women Talking goes on, even the most vivid actors start to feel reduced to positions in a rhetorical exercise—one caught between blistering urgency and a kind of tentative base covering."
Women Talking,"A wrenching drama about freedom, faith, abuse, autonomy, responsibility and survival."
Women Talking,"Though the source material is loosely based on a real-life episode in a Bolivian Mennonite village, its cinematic equivalent arrives to us as a big, ripe allegory for the ordeals faced by those traversing the hostile terrain of entertainment."
Women Talking,An ensemble acting triumph.
Women Talking,"Think of it as Twelve Angry Women -- Twelve Justifiably Furious Women -- and marvel at the shades of vengefulness, hope, sorrow, and support on display in the gallery of performances."
Women Talking,Brilliant and devastating Women Talking [is] a daring experiment in riveting conversation as high drama.
Women Talking,"In the shift of medium, we are no longer reading. The women talk, and we are listening."
Women Talking,"For better and worse, writer-director Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Women Talking is most noteworthy for its imagery."
Women Talking,"The core question of the text is what is tolerable, what is fixable, and what merits only the productive revolution of abandonment. The fundamental urgency of their inquiry feels refreshingly direct, radical even."
Women Talking,This is not a film about the evil of men. It is a film about the evil of patriarchy.
Women Talking,"While Polley’s attempt to tackle a tough issue isn’t always as polished as it could be, it’ll likely keep a lot of us talking."
Women Talking,"The entire movie is infused with a revolutionary, Year Zero spirit that becomes as exhausting as an undergraduate bull session."
Women Talking,"There's a deep vein of humor and humanity that Polley and her actors mine from the text, and something quietly mesmerizing in their world-building."
Women Talking,"Immaculately made, intellectually adventurous and politically incisive..."
Women Talking,"A movie that deliberately hovers between drama and parable, the materially concrete and the spiritually abstract, and whose stark austerity sometimes gives way to bursts of salty wit and cathartic laughter."
Women Talking,"Polley strikes a hypnotizing rhythm amongst the women, who attack despair with cheeky humor (“Women Talking” is unexpectedly funny in parts) and uncertainty with astute deliberation."
Women Talking,"Whatever you make of the experience, it’s a thrill to see a woman of Polley’s intuition pushing the language of cinema once again."
Women Talking,"Toews’ book could easily have been made into a play, but every widescreen frame of Polley’s film will make you glad that it wasn’t. She infuses this truth-inspired tale with a gripping multi-generational sweep from the very first line."
The Fabelmans,"Even though the film is based on Spielberg's life, it manages quite artfully to not feel too artful; it refuses to turn itself into a fable."
The Fabelmans,"The Fabelmans is a film that shifts something inside you. Working through one of the most crushing events of his own life, Spielberg exhorts us to discover, yet again, the enduring magic of the movies."
The Fabelmans,"Possibly the most lavishly mounted home movie ever made. Appropriately enough, that is its great strength and its fatal weakness."
The Fabelmans,"The result is neither as sentimental nor as moving – if those adjectives can be separated – as the director’s more personal 20th century films. It does, however, feel complete in itself. Cleanly shot. Immaculately performed."
The Fabelmans,"The Fabelmans’ fictional parts feel just as honest and revealing; seamless syntheses of life and art. That is Spielberg’s extraordinary gift: at 76, he’s still the boy cradling an entire medium in his hands."
The Fabelmans,"This is a movie so masterfully made, you can glide along its surface without quite realising all it’s asking of you."
The Fabelmans,Kushner and Spielberg’s ability to turn this very personal saga into a more universal story is what sets them apart from the rest.
The Fabelmans,"It makes for a strangely unsatisfying movie experience, and something akin to anticipating a sumptuous and nourishing meal but being presented only with a print-out of the recipe. Some of the ingredients are nonetheless compelling..."
The Fabelmans,"This could have been sentimental and soggy, a ""magic of the movies"" endeavour. There is some of that, but this is more than that. It’s about family, and the complexity of family, and it’s intensely personal, moving, absorbing and full of love."
The Fabelmans,"An autopsy of a marriage and a homage to invention, it’s a bittersweet piece of joy."
The Fabelmans,"The tone gets complicated. Adolescence often is. Flippancy aside, that is the movie’s signature: the acceptance that two things can be going on at once."
The Fabelmans,"Spielberg has realised that fables come in all shapes and sizes. In this hilarious and heart-breaking gem, small really is beautiful."
The Fabelmans,A sweet but never cloying jaunt down Mr Spielberg’s memory lane.
The Fabelmans,The Fabelmans left me with a floating feeling of happiness.
The Fabelmans,"What a surprise to find Spielberg, the supreme sentimentalist, occupying that murky realm. We didn’t know he had it in him."
The Fabelmans,There’s something disarmingly humble about The Fabelmans and the simplicity of its desire to pinpoint the ordinary roots of future greatness.
The Fabelmans,An affectionate and insightful peep into the inspiration and obsessions of a young filmmaker...
The Fabelmans,"It’s a beautiful, tender and emotionally complex film, one which pays tribute to Spielberg's parents but also ensures their humanity through their flaws and failings."
The Fabelmans,"Spielberg has packed all these things into a deceptively simple narrative which flows so smoothly that it’s easy to miss its finer points. In that sense, it crystallises his innate ability to translate the most delicate subtleties into entertainment."
The Fabelmans,"Looking back with adult eyes, Spielberg sees his parents with all their flaws, yet infuses the film with warmth, understanding and love."
The Fabelmans,"Writing with Tony Kushner, who brought so much dimension to the familiar stories of Lincoln and West Side Story, Spielberg turns The Fabelmans into an act of self-mythology that nonetheless picks at old scabs."
The Fabelmans,To call this a labor of love is almost diminishing.
The Fabelmans,Steven Spielberg’s 33rd feature film is a marvel coming-of-age story and one of his most personal.
The Fabelmans,...wants to reckon in a meaningful way with the idea that cinema – like any art form – can be powerful and revealing and magical... but [also] can be just as dishonest as it is honest.
The Fabelmans,"The Fabelmans is beautiful, involving, often spellbinding. Spielberg has now demonstrated that he can look inward, as well as outward, and still command every frame."
The Fabelmans,"I was really impressed by it, but I wasn't necessarily moved by it the way I usually am by Spielberg's work."
The Fabelmans,Beautiful filmmaking that reminds you why you worship at the altar of Spielberg.
The Fabelmans,"This is Spielberg’s most personal film, and it’s intriguing to watch him pay homage to the directors who made up his group of friends in the early 1970s."
The Fabelmans,The experience [is] quintessential Spielberg.
The Fabelmans,"Inevitably a self-indulgent yet delightful origin story,"
The Fabelmans,"This filmmaker has earned the right to make a movie about why he makes movies the way he does. And with Williams and Dano, especially, he gets performances that can match the technique."
The Fabelmans,"Still operating at the top of his game, [Spielberg's] ""Fabelmans"" all but guarantees there's more great work to come from him."
The Fabelmans,"The Fabelmans did not touch my heart, and it did not touch my mind. It only poked me in the eye, and kicked me in the shins."
The Fabelmans,I welcomed its general sense of optimism at a time when each news story is worse than the next and non-blockbuster movies seemingly seek to be as hard-hitting and depressing as possible.
The Fabelmans,The Fabelmans comes alive whenever it deals with the power of movies and the young director finding his voice behind the camera. Less compelling is the milquetoast family drama that surrounds it...
The Fabelmans,"...uplifting and yet deeply melancholy and really funny. Typical Spielberg. Pulling on multiple heartstrings at the same time, to great effect."
The Fabelmans,“The Fabelmans” is a movie about being seen — and about learning to see.
The Fabelmans,"“The Fabelmans” is entertaining enough, but perhaps what’s best about it is that Spielberg got it out of his system. After this, he won’t ever need to make a film about himself or his parents again."
The Fabelmans,"Spielberg’s story reflects the treachery and trickery that awaits in our own journey from innocence to adulthood, and reveals how movies, like families, can shape our future selves."
The Fabelmans,"It may not be his best, but Spielberg still rouses like no other, with a funny, heartfelt and personal story and a meta final shot that’ll leave moviegoers with a big grin."
The Fabelmans,"“The Fabelmans” does it all, with an expansive spirit and that quintessential Spielbergian combination of honesty and sentiment."
The Fabelmans,"It is told with the true mastery of a brilliant filmmaker equally grounded the mechanics of movies and the creation of big, engrossing dreams for us to watch together in the dark."
The Fabelmans,"Spielberg’s familiarly showy visual virtuosity is largely subordinated to his nuanced, glittering, excitingly detailed storytelling here, his fervent attention to the incidentals and the fine points that turn an anecdote into an experience."
The Fabelmans,"The acting is uniformly good, but Williams is exceptional, navigating a tricky role that requires her to be neither hero nor villain but something in-between, and all the more compelling for it."
The Fabelmans,"What could have been some kind of auto-hagiography is a playful, honest and ultimately gracious childhood memoir that derives its universal lessons from its specificity."
The Fabelmans,Viewers expecting a stirring childhood memoir about the power of cinema may be surprised at how bittersweet and raw the story actually is. But that vulnerability is what makes the film a triumph.
The Fabelmans,"It’s a deeply personal chronicle from one of cinema’s greatest talents, yielding a movie that features wonderful moments within a somewhat scattered narrative."
The Fabelmans,"The surprise is that, remarkably, despite all these faults, and despite Spielberg's legendary reputation, The Fabelmans never seems self-serving. It's a humble self-portrait, and the humility is most welcome."
The Fabelmans,"[O]ne of the best movies of the year, and unlike anything else in this innovator’s incomparable career."
The Fabelmans,"Bring out the Oscars for the year’s best movie, a personal best from Steven Spielberg about his own coming of age as a teen torn between his love for movies and family (Michelle Williams is incandescent as his troubled mom). You won’t forget this classic."
The Fabelmans,"“The Fabelmans” may look nice ’n’ easy as it swings along, with a pile of laughs to cushion the ride, and a nifty visual gag in the closing seconds, but take care. Here is a film that is touched with the madness of love."
The Fabelmans,A love letter from director Steven Spielberg to the people and the art form that made him who he is.
The Fabelmans,"Mr. Spielberg’s life story is always slickly directed, professionally written and admirably acted by an appealing cast, but only intermittently interesting and less than what I’d call mesmerizing."
The Fabelmans,"Spielberg’s story isn’t over yet, but he is still on top of his game at the age of 75. This movie proves it conclusively"
The Fabelmans,"Mr. Spielberg sends us on our way with a smile, and with great gratitude for everything he’s given us over these last 50 years."
The Fabelmans,"A measured and incredibly intimate look at Spielberg’s upbringing as he developed his aptitude for storytelling through a medium that mesmerized him... as an extraordinary device that not only unveils powerful truths, but often shapes them as well."
The Fabelmans,"“The Fabelmans” is, as the title says, somewhat of a fable and wonderful in both large and small ways, even if Spielberg can’t help but soften the rougher, potentially lacerating edges."
The Fabelmans,"Spielberg has learned a lot about how to make movies since 1952, but he has never lost sight of why."
The Fabelmans,"The focus sometimes gets a bit blurry, to be honest and the whole thing often doesn’t add up to much."
The Fabelmans,"I was reminded of Belfast, where a filmmaker's fascination with his own origin is perhaps unavoidably weighed down by self-indulgence and sentimentality."
The Fabelmans,"The film is a potent memory piece guided by remarkable performances from Michelle Williams and Paul Dano, who are asked to walk a delicate tonal tightrope, delivering a portrait of an imperfect marriage that's heartbreaking in its tenderness."
The Fabelmans,Spielberg just doesn’t seem to understand the most interesting aspects of his own story — nor how to structure that story.
The Fabelmans,"The master director's essayistic, autobiographical film may be little more than a victory lap. Still, no one sees things quite like he can."
The Fabelmans,It's sure to resonate with movie lovers and awards bestowers everywhere.
The Fabelmans,"As always with Spielberg, The Fabelmans is an easy, pleasurable watch, the master of classical movie narrative spinning his tales with a verve that’s the cinematic equivalent of comfort food. That smoothness blunts the movie’s sharper edges, though."
The Fabelmans,"Spielberg, an incredibly precise filmmaker, never seems certain as to what a movie about his life, or about that of a slightly outsize proxy, should look like, and that uncertainty is actually the warmest and most vulnerable quality The Fabelmans has."
The Fabelmans,"A fascinating film that directs Spielberg’s high-beam narrative focus on to this boy’s life, where the revelations of growing up can feel stranger than fiction."
The Fabelmans,"At times, The Fabelmans feels like a marathon session on the therapist’s couch, but that’s not really a criticism; the movie is rich in barbed Jewish humour, eccentricity, and prodigious teenage wheeler-dealing."
The Fabelmans,"If the movie does adhere to [Steven Spielberg's] signature beats, and feature so many recognizable Spielbergisms, occasionally to its detriment, it’s still one of the most impressive, enlightening, vital things he’s ever done."
The Fabelmans,"Not all memoir is generous. It can be intriguingly solipsistic, or maddeningly vain. But because there’s always been a curious blankness to Spielberg’s public persona, The Fabelmans does feel like something of a gift."
The Fabelmans,The Fabelmans is a provocative investigation of the cinematic medium from one of its great masters.
The Fabelmans,This bittersweet rummage through the Spielberg family album sees the maestro deliver a late-career masterwork.
The Fabelmans,"The Fabelmans is touching, but it isn’t the grand heartbreaker you might want or expect. At times, it feels about as immersive as a snow globe."
The Fabelmans,"Everything in “The Fabelmans” is real and unreal all at once, as if a documentary of the director’s life were being double-projected over his own artistic interpretation of the same events."
The Fabelmans,"Immediately joining the first ranks of artists’ memoirs, Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans is... a vivid capturing of the auteur’s earliest flashes of filmmaking insight and a portrait, full of love yet unclouded by nostalgia, of the family that made him."
The Fabelmans,"An overlong trip down memory lane that could have done with some stops removed. But it’s a sweet, at times incredibly endearing, journey back."
The Fabelmans,"If it all feels a little sanitized and idealized, it's also consistently lovely — and after 75 years and 34 films, who more than Spielberg has earned the right to revisit his stardust memories?"
The Fabelmans,"A uniquely confessional work, in which a great artist freely and happily acknowledges the manipulation inherent in the art form he was born to master."
The Fabelmans,"It’s beautiful, evocative, enthralling blockbuster filmmaking, perfectly tuned to remind viewers of the power that can reside within a movie."
The Fabelmans,"It's Spielberg's most personal film, one that gorgeously revives the memories of his childhood and youth with a lavish sense of wistfulness and an aptly Hollywood-ized, fable-like touch."
The Fabelmans,The best movie of the year so far is Steven Spielberg’s extraordinary “The Fabelmans.”
The Fabelmans,"The screenplay is a graceful gem, moving through different chapters of the life of this relatively average family that would just happen to produce an unaverage filmmaker."
The Fabelmans,"Earnest to a tee—and, frequently, to a fault—it’s a drama about the magic of the movies that itself is far too often lacking in that department."
The Fabelmans,"Spielberg’s a born storyteller, and these are arguably his most precious stories."
The Nest,Durkin's film brilliantly exposes the vacuous world of a would-be ultra-capitalist.
The Nest,"Stick with this crafty little creeper. ""The Nest"" is compelling and thoroughly unsettling."
The Nest,Relies on anxiety and attempting to unsettle those watching.
The Nest,The Nest is an intriguing and unnerving film and also a slightly frustrating one
The Nest,"The Nest is something unique: original and absolutely scary. This is thanks to the brilliant screenplay, captivating cinematography, strong direction, and excellent acting."
The Nest,There's enough here to delight fans of high concept horror with particular detail in a scene which reveals one of the little bugs in all its glory.
The Nest,"Very effective tension, with a long slow creep up to a truly chilling ending."
The Nest,James Suttles' insidious home invasion horror shows a family undone by mind-controlling parasites - or opioid addiction.
Burden,ERROR
Wendy,[Wendy] sees the director double down on his style while finding little reason to justify it.
Wendy,"A new take on Peter Pan that actually works, delivering all the visual richness you'd hope for from the film-maker behind Beasts Of The Southern Wild."
Wendy,"While by no means perfect, Wendy ... has originality, folklore, and old-school Americana to recommend it."
Wendy,"I found myself pulled along, not only by Zeitlin's tugging showmanship, but the ache he manages to create around childhood as an enchanted space."
Wendy,"This isn't a modern spin on a classic tale of fantasy and wonder, it's an outright nightmare I never want to think about ever again."
Wendy,The twee onslaught of Wendy reinforces that filmmaker Benh Zeitlin's view of childhood wonder remains superficial--and racially problematic.
Wendy,"""Wendy's"" ambition far outreaches its grasp. Rather than Neverland, Zeitlin has created a land you never want to visit."
Wendy,"A moving and powerful version of ""Peter Pan"" that might work best on adults."
Wendy,The magic of this Neverland is knowing we just have to believe and we will always be able to fly.
Wendy,"""Wendy"" is not glossy by any means but it feels like an escape from the soulless live-action Disney remakes audiences have become accustomed to."
Wendy,Beware the dream project an artist has carried in his head for too long. He may well have lost all distance on it.
Wendy,"The core concept of Wendy, in which Wendy isn't Peter's devoted follower so much as his headstrong, courageous challenger, is a good one; the movie doesn't do much with it."
Wendy,"Man cannot live on beauty alone, and the story underneath the film's beauty is ultimately thin."
Wendy,A movie about childhood that is aimed at grownups who are extremely precious about the concept of childhood.
Wendy,"[Similar to] Terrence Malick's lesser work, it's a bit muddled. I feel like [director Benh Zeitlin] was so focused on the imagery - which was quite beautiful at times - that the plot suffered."
Wendy,"All of this is very mystical, magical, and moving, but it's a bit too much."
Wendy,"The effort it must have taken to create this movie is apparent in every frame, but that doesn't mean it's watchable."
Wendy,"A film that shouldn't exist. It's a style of moviemaking that seems to have no place in today's cookie-cutter film market - that seems to have no audience, even, unless the audience is you."
Wendy,"Your wandering attention may begin to fixate on other deficiencies: the flimsiness of the narrative scaffolding, the thinness of the characterizations and the filmmakers' tendency to mistake platitudes for poetry."
Wendy,"Zeitlin - who proves more sentimental about childhood than Barrie - keeps the parts whirring, casting about for meaning that never fully comes."
Wendy,"The style is immersive, meant to envelop us and bring us into the story, but it ends up making the movie feel abstract and distant. And there's a void at the center."
Wendy,"Benh Zeitlin's take on Peter Pan from Wendy's female perspective is a mixed bag that drifts from exhilarating to enervating, burying visionary wonders and a gifted cast of amateurs in chaotic clutter that deserves, well, the hook."
Wendy,"It is an achingly earnest, feral, transporting and (very) loose reimagining of the classic J.M. Barrie tale about not wanting to grow up."
Wendy,"Wendy veers awkwardly and aimlessly between tragedy and jubilance, never accruing any lasting emotional impact."
Wendy,"Though the film contains some mesmerising visuals, the story does not correspond to the magical images on screen."
Wendy,"Zeitlin has no fresh take on the material... it's the usual clichés about resisting the encroaching disillusionment of adult life, filtered through a ""grounded"" reboot that leeches all the actual excitement and adventure, the magic, out of the story."
Wendy,"Zeitlin has come up with a second film that goes down many of the same paths as his debut, another film filled with kids rampaging as the music swells-but he puts it on a mythic stage and creates a film that is magical and messy, unruly and otherworldly."
Wendy,"What a gift Zeitlin has with children. He showed that special skill with ""Beasts,"" but does even more so here, with the kid ensemble being full of personality and entirely unrestrained."
Wendy,"Wendy is undoubtedly self-assured and in-your-face, and the gorgeous location photography certainly has an impact. But it's wrecked by chapters so lengthy they become simply excruciating."
Wendy,"There is something beautifully all-ages about the movie's kaleidoscopic score and firefly glow, but by the ninth montage of cliffs and shore and joyful screaming down a hill, it all starts to feel a little like a film-school reel."
Wendy,"""Wendy"" is fun for a while, but as it drags on, it becomes harder to follow - and worse, boring."
Wendy,"Zeitlin's roving narrative techniques may have their limitations, but this spellbinding followup proves they still have juice."
Wendy,"Every frame of the film is excitingly alive and freshly conceived, making it something very much worth seeing on the big screen."
A Call to Spy,"Given the potential of the material, there's no excuse for the dullness of A Call To Spy, a film as clumsy as its title."
A Call to Spy,"At 123 minutes, the narrative misses out on building suspense, but the emotional core of the story and the fascinating individuals keep the viewer curious."
A Call to Spy,"This is a film with big ideas but a modest budget, and sadly that is its biggest downfall."
A Call to Spy,"Telling her story on screen, along with those of other undersung heroines, is a more dynamic living tribute than any building could be."
A Call to Spy,A Call to Spy has a stolid pacing that makes you feel every minute of its two-hours-plus running time. But it's still an interesting story that's yet to fully come into the light.
A Call to Spy,"The history here is extremely important and these are people whose names we need to know. There's an OK little spy thriller in here, too, but it's a little clumsy."
A Call to Spy,A Call to Spy is an enjoyable WWII drama that ends up packing a rather unexpected emotional punch.
A Call to Spy,"Like the story it follows, it's the result of many talented women working together for the common good."
A Call to Spy,"It's refreshing to come at the spy genre from a different angle and rewarding to be introduced to these extraordinary women. Just don't expect a pulse-pounder or even a particularly atmospheric, experiential film."
A Call to Spy,"An engrossing and often thrilling spy drama, and a tribute to this courageous and diverse group of women."
A Call to Spy,Even with all the conflations and simplifications... A Call to Spy is undeniably a heartfelt take on a fascinating and heartbreaking true tale of heroism.
A Call to Spy,"The title may fall flat but the movie, a sturdy directorial debut for producer Lydia Dean Pilcher, gets to the heart of the matter."
A Call to Spy,"""A Call to Spy"" is a welcome, albeit imperfect, addition to the existing slate of movies about World War II."
A Call to Spy,"Because its focus is so split, the film lacks the pervasive sense of danger one expects from a spy thriller."
Golda,Film probably not the ideal medium for this fascinating but complex episode.
Golda,"[Mirren's] relentless courage and self-assurance have obviously convinced her she can play any role she so desires. True, she can play a lot of them. Aging, dowdy Israeli prime minister Golda Meir is not one of them."
Golda,"There is no trace of Helen Mirren in Golda, and that’s the way it ought to be. To say that she becomes the fabled Israeli Prime Minister is a mild understatement, and it should come as no surprise that she delivers a great performance."
Golda,"Perceptions may be colored by revisionist political opinions of Meir, but Mirren embodies a complex character of conscience and empathy, who feels deeply and acts decisively to preserve an independent state even as she herself is disappearing. A gem."
Golda,"Helen Mirren gets lost beneath layers of heavy prosthetics and a swirl of incessant cigarette smoke in “Golda."""
Golda,"It’s a war film told from a statewoman’s point of view, which both works and doesn’t."
Golda,The real Meir has more energy and charisma in the few seconds when she’s shown onscreen than Mirren has in 100 minutes.
Golda,"The more glaring problem is that Golda itself never rises above the level of an actor’s showcase, never achieves — despite some noticeable effort — a more complicated, challenging reading of history."
Golda,"It is the woman at the center of the story whose personality and contradictions are given short shrift, in any deep sense."
Golda,"Though the contours of its story are fairly standard statesman-at-war drama, “Golda” is unusually blunt about the internal devastation that comes with overseeing military operations."
Golda,Nattiv mixes real footage with re-creations and you can’t help but wonder if the subject matter could have been explored more thoroughly in nonfiction format.
Golda,[Mirren's] so-so performance is weighed down all the more by a disappointing dearth of context about this fascinating woman.
Golda,"It’s not clear why smoking is so important to the filmmakers. Perhaps it’s to show Meir’s stubbornness or single-mindedness or stress release, but it just becomes a filmmaking crutch, like real nicotine."
Golda,"As one imagines the burden of wearing Meir’s artificial skin, you can practically hear Nattiv hiss: Now imagine putting yourself in the actual woman’s orthopedic shoes."
Golda,"For those with a particular interest in Meir, Israel, or 20th century Middle East history, there’s enough here to hold a viewer’s attention."
Golda,"Mirren portrays Meir in her darkest days at the height of the 1973 Yom Kippur War with empathy and loving subtlety. It’s hard to imagine anyone doing it better, and this is territory that was once mined by Ingrid Bergman..."
Golda,Helen Mirren’s makeup-enhanced act of mimicry as the Middle Eastern Prime Minister is remarkable.
Golda,Most of Nattiv’s film is a dry and frustrating affair.
Golda,"Cinematically, Golda doesn’t altogether avoid a TV-movie stodginess – it looks a bit drab, with some duff effects and uneven staging. But it has a businesslike running time, and doesn’t waste it."
Golda,"Of all the many talents demonstrated by formidable screen presence Helen Mirren, the ability to act her way out of a rubber mask is not one."
Golda,"Helen Mirren's playing of Golda as a woman of steel, unafraid to take tough decisions, is astute; she also looks remarkably like the real Golda."
Golda,Plucking Golda out of her own life and that time out of its wider context... feels like a missed opportunity.
Golda,A lumps-and-all showcase for Mirren and makeup.
Golda,"A lumbering, heavy, solemn film smothered by its own weighty self-consciousness."
Golda,“Golda” is a good drama about Israel. But it will take a great drama about Israel to dig into the nation’s long-simmering moral ambiguities.
Ammonite,"Lee has, over his two films so far, proven a dab hand at teasing out unexpressed, furtive desires, depicting both the visceral emotions and gritty physicality of same-sex romance with empathy and an understated artistic flair."
Ammonite,"It adds up to an expertly crafted film that nonetheless feels somewhat distanced and removed, like an exhibit under glass."
Ammonite,The overly orchestrated sex scenes often feel more intrusive than intimate.
Ammonite,"A perfectly respectable, eminently professional slice of prestige arthouse."
Ammonite,"Kate Winslet slowly illuminates Mary from the inside, passion fighting caution beneath that classically composed demeanour. It's one of the performances of her career."
Ammonite,"Another film would threaten a scandal. Lee is more interested in the stuff of desire - what pulls couples together and apart, how power shifts between them."
Ammonite,"It is tempting to wonder whether Lee is already working to a formula... Forgive these mannerisms, though, and Ammonite becomes a film of earthy, robust sensuality."
Ammonite,"There's something so ""complete"" about Ammonite, with a resonant ending that is poetic in its refusal to give us what we want."
Ammonite,"Another tenderly executed triumph from Francis Lee, and a captivating, serrated starring performance from Kate Winslet. Ammonite is a fine feat in British filmmaking craft."
Ammonite,...acted with frank sensuality by Winslet and Ronan...
Ammonite,"[Director Francis] Lee did persuade me that this was a love that might have been. And a happy love, at that."
Ammonite,"A love letter to two extraordinary historical figures told through a fictional tale, Ammonite is also a moving, thoughtful and very sexy love story in and of itself."
Ammonite,"Movies about repressed or secret queer romance seem to use queer relationships as an emblem of deep self-truth and rebellion against the confines of a patriarchal society. And for a good portion of its runtime, Ammonite takes that spirit and runs with it."
Ammonite,"A tale of corsets and cunnilingus, this sapphic drama illustrates the problems that arise when the message becomes the medium...its outrage over injustice is as blunt as its sex scenes, which have the estranging effect of being both explicit and opaque."
Ammonite,"Winslet and Ronan well capture the magnetic draw between two people who recognize in each other a trapped spirit, and who are determined to help shake the other free."
Ammonite,"[Ammonite] is many things, all of them remarkable: a queer romance that finds passion in austerity; a biopic that strips away most details of Anning's career while honoring its spirit; and a portrait of genius thwarted by gender."
Ammonite,At times... the strong performances by Winslet and Ronan seem to be all that separate this movie from a soft-core bodice-ripper.
Ammonite,"Made with delicacy and care by a cast and crew determined to animate a complex central character, Ammonite may skirt the truth when it comes to history but it uncovers a pure vein when exploring Mary's inner life."
Ammonite,It captures the essence of a forbidden attraction at a time when same-sex love was stifled and considered deviant.
Ammonite,"It's just a lot of smoke, which makes it even harder to see through the film's hazy lens."
Ammonite,"Like Mary and the sea rocks she tends, Ammonite's hard exterior eventually gives way to something beautiful."
Ammonite,"This is less a story about love than it is about loneliness... Kate Winslet is great as Mary Anning, wearing that isolation like a coat shielding her from the elements."
Ammonite,Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan make a fascinating couple in the well-spun period piece.
Ammonite,"It's a plain and inarguable fact that we all deserve a movie in which Winslet and Ronan, specialists in complex women, play unlikely lovers whose bonnets are just itching to get ripped off. A reasonable person wouldn't complain."
Ammonite,"Their passion never catches fire, but... the award-winning duo tries hard."
Ammonite,"A film like this should give life to its characters and reveal essential truths beyond the book-report versions of their existence. But ""Ammonite"" keeps you at a distance on a rather vacant, but beautiful, journey."
Ammonite,"Ammonite has moments of delicacy and beauty, but it's not a movie for everybody."
Ammonite,"Yes, it's about paleontology, but hold the yawns. Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan hit new acting peaks in Francis Lee's deliberately-paced portrait of two ladies on fire in Victorian England."
Ammonite,"Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are very good in a fairly good, slightly stiff second feature by writer-director Francis Lee."
Ammonite,"There is a refreshing change with Ammonite, though. Whereas most period-set queer dramas are steered by hot-blooded ""forbidden romance"" tropes, Lee normalizes Mary and Charlotte's relationship."
Ammonite,"It's frankly hard to describe Ammonite without making the movie sound as derivative as it is. The performances, however, elevate the material, as Winslet and Ronan each convey grappling with different kinds of trauma without speaking about what ails them."
Ammonite,"""Ammonite"" is only the director Francis Lee's second feature, yet already he's developing a strong visual signature, at once eloquent and elemental."
Ammonite,"Rather than a movie that breaks the mold, it looks like Anning has inspired one we've seen before."
Ammonite,"Lee's grim tone is relentless, and I'm curious why: He's invented a queer relationship where there's no historical evidence for one. Why not let it take flight, then, rather than leaving it stuck in the mud?"
Ammonite,"Lee lets us indulge in a belated outrage for a woman denied her place in science and history, but it's Winslet's carefully calibrated empathy toward Mary Anning that keeps us rapt."
Ammonite,An exquisite achievement...
Ammonite,It's well-made and it's thoughtful. But Lee's style is sparse and that kind of sparseness leaves little room for this lack of romantic connection between the actors.
Ammonite,Francis Lee's compulsion to make Mary Anning stand in for something broader than herself keeps tripping up the film.
Ammonite,Kate Winslet is ferocious.
Ammonite,"The movie persuades you, and bears you along."
Ammonite,"As with the rocks Anning can't get enough of, this romance contains multitudes."
Ammonite,"Francis Lee's forbidden-love story in 1840s England is vital and austere, not unlike the fossilized sea creature that gives the film its title and poignant symbol."
Ammonite,"An over-reliance on visual aids is not a crime in itself. But coupled with some clunky lines, heat-free chemistry and a pair of oddly muted performances, the results are a wobbly-lipped bodice ripper that's verging on parody..."
Ammonite,James Ivory might be proud and even jealous of the way writer-director Francis Lee takes the Anglo art house tradition of quality to an uncustomary level of sexual frankness.
Ammonite,"Winslet and Ronan don't have chemistry so much as a kind of mesmerising tectonic accord, and slowly but surely, the two converge."
Ammonite,"Right now, give Winslet your undivided attention."
Ammonite,There's so much grace and nuance in this performance that it truly could be studied to consider all of the smart decisions that Winslet makes in each scene.
Ammonite,"The contained, potent performance is one of Winslet's best."
Ammonite,"Lee's approach to the material... is grimly beautiful at times: Take the sound design, which contrasts the untamed sounds of the natural world with the ticking of prim Victorian timepieces."
Ammonite,"""Ammonite"" is a passionate love story nourished by the salty sea air and the blissful absence of men; it's also a sharp reflection on how the artistic, scientific and intellectual contributions of women have been systematically written out of history."
Ammonite,"Loving someone doesn't ensure you will always be able to understand them; Lee and his stars may love these characters, but they never understand them. Neither can we."
Ammonite,"Whatever the truth of Anning and Murchison's time in Dorset together was, Ammonite could have done whatever it wanted. It chooses instead to do close to nothing, and leaves us, quite like its central pair, helplessly grasping for more."
Ammonite,"Deeply emotional but rarely sentimental, it is orchestrated by a director who is determined to have every moment of pain or pleasure play out with exquisite restraint."
Ammonite,A film as delicate as this should not be pushed or even nudged.
Ammonite,"It is a love story that is also a fascinating artefact: quixotic, romantic, erotic."
Ammonite,"[L]ike its coiled seashell muse, though, Ammonite finds its beauty in the whole, not the parts."
Ammonite,"[I]t's too simple, almost basic, leaving one grateful that two stars of this caliber would take on such a story, while wishing their efforts had left us with a more resonant artifact."
Ammonite,"In many ways it's a deceptively modest work, but Ammonite just floored me; I can't think of a single aspect that could be improved upon."
Ammonite,"""Ammonite"" sadly feels too distant, underpowered and colorless for its own good, as if somewhere down the line, its heart had died and hardened like a fossil waiting to be discovered."
Come Away,"I was really ready to be transported, and really disappointed when I wasn't. It's a real shame, because there's a lot of talent in this film but it just doesn't work."
Come Away,"Assembled with scattershot ineptitude by the Brave director Brenda Chapman, it smacks of a Ken Loach project rebooted by Nickelodeon, but not as compelling as that sounds."
Come Away,"It never quite tumbles into Wonderland, but the ambition at play - and a top cast of supporting players - is just enough to let Come Away off the Hook."
Come Away,"The second word in the title should perhaps be replaced with ""off it"". Or maybe replace the first word with ""go""."
Come Away,"That it has so little new to say, and replaces spirited fantasy with an overbearing glumness, is just disappointing."
Come Away,It's hard to muster much excitement for a movie as stiff and serious as this.
Come Away,"I don't know what Come Away is supposed to be, what lessons it's imparting, or for whom it was even made."
Come Away,"Too dreary for youngsters and too rote for grown-ups, ""Come Away"" empties itself of magic."
Come Away,The film can't seem to decide whether it's fantasy or allegory and whether its characters are fan fiction or flesh and blood.
Come Away,It just feels like a pretty idea that didn't get fully developed; an origin story that we didn't need.
Come Away,"""Come Away"" is an idea that never takes flight."
Come Away,"""Come Away"" may not hold a candle to the stories it references, but it shines with an illuminating and aspirational light all its own."
Come Away,"In the end, you're left wondering what was real, whether it was all just a dream or if you're just too grown up to understand."
Come Away,"In a different world, Come Away may have very well worked as an animated film that would have toned down a lot of its darker elements. But as it stands now, unfortunately, Chapman's prior works reign far more supreme."
Come Away,"Although elements of the two source stories will be familiar to audiences of any age, Goodhill has created a fresh tale that flies."
Come Away,"Audiences may resist the moral of this movie, but they're likely to get caught up in the execution."
Come Away,"A wealth of familiar storybook material and a cast including Angelina Jolie and David Oyelowo will draw attention, but a handsome production and beautiful cast aren't enough to get this fantasy off the ground."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Loud and obnoxious...quite astonishingly panned, and it's so bad that there's an outside possibility it might become a marginal cult classic. But honestly? I doubt it."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Shanley has an Oscar and a Pulitzer (he wrote the sublime Moonstruck, and the stage and screen versions of Doubt). Here, that's easy to forget..."
Wild Mountain Thyme,Paddywhackery of the highest order is delivered in this execrable rom-com that's almost surreal in its unashamed awfulness.
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Wild Mountain Thyme is neither fish or fowl. It isn't bonkers enough to gain ""so bad it's good"" cult status, nor is it believable enough to be taken seriously. I simply didn't care."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Sadly, not even a strong cast can rescue a pot of gold from the end of this rainbow."
Wild Mountain Thyme,One remains staggered that sentient human beings who walk upright and use cutlery believed this was a respectable use of their valuable time.
Wild Mountain Thyme,Blunt and Walken's brogue-off makes this the King Kong v Godzilla event of inauthentic Irish voices.
Wild Mountain Thyme,[A] film so frivolous and twee I felt as if my brain were leaking out of my nostrils as I watched.
Wild Mountain Thyme,The whole film feels like an elaborate prank.
Wild Mountain Thyme,"As a romantic drama, it's total nonsense. But as an escape from reality, you could do worse."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"The two leads are watchable enough, but the script keeps their characters emotionally separated, so you never see anything remotely like chemistry between them."
Wild Mountain Thyme,Magically delicious... How these two sexy stunners could live side by side and not fall madly in love despite the arrival of his boorish but hot American cousin makes for a very heavy fantasy soufflé.
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Over and over again, you won't know whether to feel baffled or amused -- although by the end, the former feeling most assuredly dominates the latter."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"""Wild Mountain Thyme"" is the kind of film you want to love, just as you want these two characters to fall in love, and it's simultaneously exasperating and original that they don't go about their courtship in the usual fashion."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"To be fair, nobody truly Irish would ever think that Guinness from a bottle is going to be the same as a pint in a pub."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"John Patrick Shanley, the writer of ""Moonstruck,"" made one fatal error with his new romantic comedy, ""Wild Mountain Thyme"": He directed it."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"When all is said and done, the movie itself is for the birds."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Wild Mountain Thyme is not just charmless. It is genuinely confounding, a movie constantly working against itself to make its characters and their dilemma comprehensible."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Whimsy gives way to malarkey. And, blimey, someone should have hired an Irish dialect coach."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"The film takes such a circuitous route down a familiar path, and does so with such wit and eccentricity, that the experience as a whole becomes harder and harder to resist."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"A romantic comedy/drama whose tone ping-pongs from grave to lyrical to absurdist willy-nilly, and hits all those registers at fortissimo volume."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Writer-director John Patrick Shanley's old-fashioned, at times transporting, romantic comedy ""Wild Mountain Thyme"" has a lot going for it, which makes it a shame that it's not a wholly stronger film."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"Jamie Dornan is a stiff whom John Hamm immediately upstages, and this dynamic underscores why the film is so tedious and unsatisfying."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"The gentle spirit of ""Wild Mountain Thyme"" envelops us early, to the extent that, midway through, even though there is very little left to resolve, we are in its spell."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"If you are one of those mischievous little devils who thrives on onscreen chaos, however, Wild Mountain Thyme is for you. Everyone else? Not so much."
Wild Mountain Thyme,This movie falls a few ounces short of a full pint.
Wild Mountain Thyme,"""Wild Mountain Thyme"" might be just the understated blend you need for a cold December night."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"By the time there are soaring pan flutes and kisses in the rain, you've either happily surrendered or slumped over, Walken-wasted. Either way somebody, or at least the whiskey, wins."
Wild Mountain Thyme,Those eager for entertainment with any kind of edge or cultural authenticity should look elsewhere.
Wild Mountain Thyme,"If Anthony is a tree, he isn't rooted in reality, and the only magic here is found in Blunt's ability to conjure a flesh-and-blood woman out of a pouty male fantasy."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"[I]t's certainly watchable, even pleasant - if you can get past whatever nonsense the characters are saying."
Wild Mountain Thyme,"The one success story of ""Wild Mountain Thyme"" belongs to Blunt, who has yet to give a poor or lazily considered performance."
The Climb,"For all the absurdist laughs (and not a few cringes) both men wring from it, their interplay feels both inherently ridiculous and entirely true to life; a bittersweet bromance writ in whiskey and spandex."
The Climb,"""The Climb"" often gets in its own way. Just like its characters don't know when enough is enough, neither does Covino."
The Climb,"It's often quite funny, but it's also sad. It's grounded, but with all these tiny touches of surrealism."
The Climb,"Cringe comedy's premise is that old wisdom about train wrecks and why we can't help but stop and stare despite ourselves, and Covino and Marvin's movie is a convincing case in point."
The Climb,The Climb entertains while capturing the cycle of two schlemiels whose bond exceeds the sum of their parts.
The Climb,"The scene that kicks off The Climb is by far the best thing in the entire movie, but don't hold that against the picture - the rest of it is pretty great, too."
The Climb,"Covino and Marvin, who co-wrote the script and are actual buddies... give utterly natural performances."
The Climb,"It's a beautiful film, a piece of absurdism that goes straight to the heart."
The Climb,"The movie has a good amount of truth and a fair amount of enjoyable lies, and it ends with a shrug that contradicts the scars we've spent 97 minutes watching get inflicted."
The Climb,"There are no sentimental easy answers or shortcuts to uplift in this unusually prickly buddy comedy. Like Kyle and Mike, it just keeps peddling forward, in the hope that some kind of clarity might materialize at the top of the hill."
The Climb,The emotional core of the film - the love that supposedly binds Kyle and Mike in spite of everything - is empty.
The Climb,"The sharp writing, fearless acting, and creative direction (there's one tracking shot that is ingenious), make ""The Climb"" an uncompromising look at straight white guys."
The Climb,The film is a wholehearted and hilarious ode to a fraternal bond more profound and enduring than any romantic attachment.
The Climb,"Wryly funny but deeply felt, a brilliantly written, performed and executed moment of unflinching and intimate truth between two men, at once devastating and hilarious."
The Climb,"It's just fantastic. Sorry, fantastique."
The Climb,"A feature debut written and directed with supreme assurance by Covino, it also boasts the most staggering long takes since 1917. As comedies go, this is our most exciting discovery of the year."
The Climb,"Though the characters range from ciphers to clichés, they nonetheless get caught in some unusual comedic tangles that Covino laces with heartfelt observations."
The Climb,The film slides seamlessly between empathizing with its clueless bros and making them objects of unsparing derision.
The Climb,"It lost my sympathy...it is well-made, but I simply lost patience for it."
The Climb,"The film is shrewd on male friendship, suggesting that a lot of men are vulnerable and crave intimacy, but are often too poor at communicating to truly reach for it."
The Climb,"Covino's novice direction is alarmingly assured, mixing together musical diversions, lip-synching dance sequences and audacious tracking camera moves with the ease of an in-form Scorsese."
The Climb,"Superbly written and performed by actual friends Kyle Marvin and Michael Angelo Covino, The Climb is a smart, funny, small-scale delight. More please."
The Climb,Hilarious and deliciously off-kilter. I loved every second of it.
The Climb,"You realise that what you're watching is an epic disguised as scuffed indie comedy, a portrait of adult friendship in which no one ever completely grows up."
The Climb,"Co-writers Covino and Rankin are friends and observe their characters beautifully. They don't ignore the female roles, either."
The Climb,Thrilling and charming in a way that very few comedies ever are.
The Climb,"Toxic masculinity is played for rich and revealing farce in writer/director Michael Angelo Covino's assured feature debut, told over multiple years."
The Climb,"Life is an uphill battle says The Climb, a film that gets better as it goes, even if life often does not."
The Climb,"The Climb offers several portraits of ordinary messed-up people who can't accomplish the fantasies only found in a Hollywood script: the ability to truly grow and change, yet they discover a journey just as charming."
The Climb,"Covino shows truly impressive formal control, incorporating sophisticated camerawork and tightly coiled edits while allowing time, space and rhythm - in short, the foundations of cinema - to play as equal participants in the comedy."
The Climb,What impresses most is that the laughs and bittersweet insights into rollercoaster relationships never flag - and that is what really elevates this comedy to greatness.
The Climb,"All of this might come across as little more than restless film school showmanship if Covino and Marvin didn't have such appealing onscreen chemistry, and a commitment to the chapter-based approach that basically allows them to get away with anything."
The Climb,"This inventive, accomplished piece is certain to be a festival crowd-pleaser, and is likely to score with international audiences who like their indie comedy with a harsh, somewhat Seinfeld-ian edge."
The Climb,A clever comic bromance backed by artful filmmaking.
The Climb,"Beautifully written and performed by the director and real-life BFF Kyle Marvin, Covino's film gets precisely the balance of dependency and denial that keeps a bad bromance afloat."
Clemency,Clemency is proof of just how effortlessly [Woodard] can lead a film.
Clemency,A masterwork.
Clemency,"Woodard, unshowy and preternaturally still, offers us a stubborn professional being steadily eaten up by her involvement with the glacially slow killing-machine."
Clemency,"It takes an actor of Woodard's calibre to show us how Bernadine arrived at this point, and why she finds herself so conflicted."
Clemency,Clemency is one of those deliberately harrowing movies that leaves you feeling elated. The very precision of the film-making gives you a sense of hope.
Clemency,"The moral and ethical debates around the death penalty rarely touch on the toll it takes on the people involved, but that's the grey area writer-director Chinonye Chukwu explores with a humanist's touch and an keen ear for all her characters."
Clemency,Chukwu's devastating and complex character study advances the discourse around capital punishment beyond the usual contrived talking points.
Clemency,"It's a towering performance from Woodard, her career masterpiece, and she is first among equals in an outstanding cast."
Clemency,"Woodard's, obviously, is the talking-point performance, a ridiculously nuanced turn that will keep drama students occupied for years."
Clemency,Moving. Woodard is superb. A good way to spend your time.
Clemency,[Alfre Woodard's] work in the death row drama Clemency offers ample proof that she is operating at the highest altitude of screen acting.
Clemency,"Once or twice, the script falls prey to underlining. More often, the story speaks for itself, accompanied by stark, eloquent visual choices."
Clemency,"Alfre Woodard gives an unforgettably moving performance in Chinonye Chukwu's slow-burning, perfectly observed drama about the repercussions of state-sanctioned violence, in which the stakes could hardly be higher."
Clemency,"[I]t's Woodard's movie, and her character's silent anguish rests just below the surface of her stone-faced veneer. It's a powerful performance in a powerful movie."
Clemency,"Clemency establishes its tone quite quickly, one that mirrors the life of Bernadine. It is one of clipped and workmanlike scenes of her life."
Clemency,"The real question isn't whether this person or that person will be executed, but whether Bernardine will go to pieces, and yet with a performance like Woodard's at the center, that's all a movie needs."
Clemency,"It's the kind of film that stays with the audience long after the credits roll. Unlike a pretty little gold statuette, that's not something that can fit neatly on (director) Chukwu's mantle but she should cherish it nonetheless."
Clemency,"I hate the amateur quarterbacking I'm about to engage in, but that [Woodard's] performance did not merit an Academy Award nomination is damning."
Clemency,"While admittedly spartan in its stylistic approach, Clemency is wrenching in its performances and direction."
Clemency,"""Clemency"" isn't exactly a good time at the movies, but it's definitely an enlightening one."
Clemency,"Much of ""Clemency"" is told through the facial expressions of Woodard, an actor of the highest calibre who knows the most powerful stories are often the ones that need the fewest words to tell."
Clemency,"The title of ""Clemency"" refers to the mercy extended to a prisoner, but it's the wisdom of this grave and sorrowful drama to spread the meaning to everyone in its view."
Clemency,Woodard's performance as a woman at the point of cracking is the reason to see this film.
Clemency,"Ms. Woodard is superb, as always, in a role that sets up a formidable barrier between character and audience. We understand what's happening to Bernadine, but it's hard to have any sense of dramatic release because her repression is almost unrelenting."
Clemency,The movie's moral and emotional burden rests on the capable shoulders of Alfre Woodard.
Clemency,"This is screen acting of a very rare sort, and Clemency is a vital emotional powerhouse sorely deserving of being seen."
Clemency,"""Clemency"" is remarkable for the understanding it affords to all involved with its wrenching subject matter."
Clemency,"Clemency does what few other movies about death row have, handling a thorny, infinitely complicated subject in terms that are neither moralizing nor melodramatic."
Clemency,Alfre Woodard [is] absolutely extraordinary here.
Clemency,A fascinating character study. Alfre Woodard does so much and so subtly.
Clemency,"Woodard gives an Oscar-worthy performance here, often expressing so much despair without saying a word.... ""Clemency"" is a somber film. Its power comes less from the drama and more from the arresting performances and the storytelling."
Clemency,"With a devastating performance as a prison warden who oversees executions, the actress brings the toll of the death penalty to wrenching life. Like the movie she inhabits with every fiber of her being, Woodard is some kind of miracle."
Clemency,"It's a small movie, but one that provides considerable food for thought, while being elevated by a performance from Woodard that, often without uttering a word, betrays an inner conflict that cuts to her very core."
Clemency,"The strong performances of the ensemble support Chukwu's unsettling examination into the many ways the criminal justice system implicates, shames, and corrupts those ensnared by it, regardless of whether they're inside or outside the bars."
Clemency,A brutal and beautiful meditation on the reality of death and the barbarism of state-sponsored execution.
Clemency,"An intensely focused character study, driven by a bone-deep performance from Woodard."
Clemency,"While a woman like Bernadine would be reticent about expressing her presumed moral impasse due to the fact that she's a woman in a very masculine industry, Chukwu's rather aloof screenplay doesn't really allow her to grapple with any of that."
Clemency,Chinonye Chukwu's film is a morality play with a true sense of contradiction and melancholia.
Clemency,"Clemency is a compelling character portrait of a woman caught within a perfect storm of ideological volatility; as both witness and part of the machine, it is her very professionalism that places her humanity in crisis"
Clemency,"A brave, emotionally charged and brilliantly acted drama centred around the thorny subject of Capital Punishment."
Clemency,[Alfre] Woodard creates a protagonist who is equally likeable and unapproachable. Her steely performance is complemented by supporting cast members.
Clemency,[Clemency] continue the work of highlighting racial inequality in the justice system.
Clemency,"Clemency's end credits arrive with relief, not because we're unengaged but because, unlike Bernadine, we're finally allowed to breathe."
Clemency,"A heavy, deliberate film... anchored by an absolutely stunning performance from Woodard."
Clemency,"As a character study, [Clemency] is incredible. As a study of death row, it's necessary."
Clemency,"Chukwu's film is further proof that great moviemaking is key to bringing audiences into profound, somber head spaces."
Clemency,"If Chukwu just wants the audience to witness Bernadine's burden, the script overplays its hand by questioning Anthony's guilty conviction."
Clemency,"With visual austerity and not an ounce of sentimentality, Chukwu transforms a character study into an indictment of institutionalized murder."
Clemency,A mature star-driven vehicle elevated by a brilliant performance that deserves all the awards it can get.
Clemency,"With quiet power and austere visuals, ""Clemency"" captures the unbearable atmosphere of offices and corridors suffused with the stench of death."
Clemency,A measured advocacy drama with the capacity to change minds.
Chevalier,This was a compelling period of French history and the narrative composed for the film makes the most of the volatile backdrop.
Chevalier,"Both Robinson and Williams share a particular interest in this unfairly neglected episode in black history, but they never allow polemics to overwhelm the narrative."
Chevalier,"There are hints of greatness in Chevalier, but it’s worthier of polite applause than a standing ovation."
Chevalier,Entertainingly soapy fare with an unabashedly brash and anachronistic approach to its 18th-century tale.
Chevalier,"Though the experienced TV director Stephen Williams dutifully follows Bologne through a clash with Antoinette and the Paris Opera, and eventually into the French Revolution, the project fails to earn the required gravitas."
Chevalier,"Williams and Robinson's insistence on converting this important story about the earliest European musician and composer of African descent to receive widespread acclaim into contemporary American talking points, often feels misguided."
Chevalier,"Unfortunately, despite the extraordinary details of the chevalier’s life – and beyond splashy set pieces like its opening scene – Chevalier struggles to find a story."
Chevalier,"The latter half of Chevalier is a little by-the-numbers compared to its energetic opening violin duel — though it is uplifted by its sharp critique of white institutions, and a strong performance from Kelvin Harrison Jr."
Chevalier,"Bigotry and tragedy loom, and the film has moments of power and outrage. But the précis risks reducing the multitalented Chevalier to a mere starburst of charisma."
Chevalier,It is handsomely mounted yet strangely bland and strikes too many false notes.
Chevalier,"As a portrait of a thrillingly toxic friendship, Chevalier hits all the right notes."
Chevalier,"While Harrison’s performance may never fully reveal the nature of the man beneath these sumptuous layers of organza, silk and self-confidence, it’s enchanté Chevalier, all the same."
Chevalier,This is a film about a significant moment in the past that is less interested in that past than in converting it into the present. That’s an opportunity wasted.
Chevalier,"This retelling of 18th century French violinist-composer Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges’ life is steeped in history but rocked with a modern imagination."
Chevalier,"The story of Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, is a crucial and necessary corrective to the historical record and our understanding of this time period. But “Chevalier” the film fails to express the radical spirit that it seemed to promise."
Chevalier,"Though the movie can feel like a powdered wig soap opera, Kelvin Harrison Jr. dazzles as Joseph Bologne."
Chevalier,"Joseph Bologne’s story is inherently fascinating, and Williams and Robinson tell it with imaginative vitality."
Chevalier,Engaging when imagining how Bologne existed in 18th century France with the understanding we have now about microaggressions and invisible barriers.
Chevalier,A solid and handsome portrait that’s also frustratingly conventional in its structure and tone.
Chevalier,"Though it occasionally pulls its punches, the blows “Chevalier” does land sting and leave a mark."
Chevalier,"As a celebration of a musical genius, Chevalier is a wildly entertaining ride, a thrilling history lesson in the making that remains as timely as ever."
Chevalier,"""Chevalier"" makes a case for its subject that his story should be told. But it feels like a starting point for learning about him, a story rather than the story, about who he was and what he meant to history."
Chevalier,"A film that bows to “Bridgerton,” while lacing its intrigue with contemporary racial-cultural wounds."
Chevalier,"Despite its bumps, “Chevalier” is worth seeing. It does its job of illuminating an erased historical figure."
Chevalier,"It’s grand, sweeping and lavishly appointed, but also bombastic and contrived."
Chevalier,Chevalier succeeds in revealing the astounding life of a man to an audience unfamiliar with him.
Chevalier,History almost erased Joseph Bologne; this film lets him live again.
Chevalier,This is a provocative introduction to a historical figure whose life and existence has been largely overlooked until now. For that reason one can readily applaud the film and enjoy its strengths. But the movie isn’t nearly as good as its subject
Chevalier,Kelvin Harrison Jr. takes ownership of every second of screen time he’s granted -- which is all the time.
Chevalier,"Chevalier may be more fiction than history, but it’s worthwhile with effective acting, tension (helped by Kris Bowers’ score) and a decadently beautiful production."
Chevalier,"While the film plays loosely with the facts, Harrison plays Bologne in a way that garners empathy and makes you root for him, even when he’s not the most pleasant."
Chevalier,For myriad reasons Chevalier’s energy and imagination never feel adequately reflected in this cinematic retelling.
Chevalier,Less a definitive portrait than a fascinating departure point for further reading and research.
Chevalier,"Chevalier doesn’t match the revolutionary spirit of Joseph Bologne’s life, but there’s still a lot of enjoyment to be taken from seeing a towering figure, long forgotten by history, returned to his rightful place at center stage."
Chevalier,"Chevalier is a lesson in humility, and that sometimes we get in our own way."
Chevalier,"Chevalier Or: How to take a grand subject -- the life and times of 18th-century Creole violinist-conductor-composer Joseph Bologne -- and dumb it down into a strident, shallow melodrama pitched at the rear balcony."
Chevalier,"The always dashing Harrison gives a wholly freeing performance, uplifting the lesser parts of this biopic for a visually resplendent and captivating take on a musical genius."
Chevalier,"If you watch the film with the sound off, it can easily be mistaken for a French studio production made in adherence to the Tradition of Quality. But while it purports to celebrate a forgotten historical figure, much of the plot is decidedly ahistorical."
Chevalier,"Though the film starts and finishes with swaggering demonstrations of politicized revolt, the rest lapses into the conventions of a genre fatally attached to them"
Chevalier,"Few people are as deserving as the grand-scale biopic as Joseph Bologne, and even when it’s hitting false notes, “Chevalier” dazzles because of the untapped magic of its central character."
Judy,"Garland's life is so inherently emotional and Zellweger's performance is so appreciably raw, that Judy manages to wring pathos by the end."
Judy,"Judy, a musical drama, is both a warm and loving tribute to the actor and singer Judy Garland as well as a cautionary tale about the pressures and impact of celebrity."
Judy,"This is a movie that showcases Zellweger's considerable talents, and for that alone, Judy is worth the price of entry."
Judy,"Garland must have been exasperating to work with, but Zellweger's performance goes right to the heart of what made her a superstar."
Judy,"Judy ... is happy to let [Renée] Zellweger take centre stage. Thank god, because it's the performance of a lifetime."
Judy,"Zellweger hasn't quite lost her off-putting propensity for straining for effect by scrunching up her face and squinting into the distance. Nonetheless, it's a remarkable performance."
Judy,"At its strongest, the film captivates; it grabs you by the heart and demands adoration. And in a film about Judy Garland, you would expect nothing less."
Judy,"Just concentrate on Judy's emotional journey, though, and you'll be fine."
Judy,Much of Judy feels a little inert.
Judy,It's a film that is just designed around thing specifically: showcasing Renée Zellweger's incredible performance as Judy Garland.
Judy,"Zellweger captures Garland's jittery, broken-bird fragility (if not the singing voice) and I was often on the edge of my seat."
Judy,"Zellweger looks like Garland, sounds like her and even, at best, sings like her."
Judy,"This is a portrait of a deeply lonely woman, and its best scenes are both poignant and gently amusing."
Judy,Renée Zellweger knocks it over the rainbow with her Hollywood comeback.
Judy,It feels more like an Oscar grab than a true disappearance into character.
Judy,"[T]he Garland story is something singular. So is Renée Zellweger's performance, which makes a sad story elevated, elevating and all about love."
Judy,"Although Judy doesn't adhere rigorously to the chronology of the main character's last months, it provides a compelling portrait of the tragic decline of one of America's 20th century icons."
Judy,"She was an immensely complicated figure, but in Judy, she's a martyr."
Judy,"What Judy misses is the unimpeachable fact that helped her survive the punishing ordeals, both personal and professional-her dazzling sense of humor, none of which is in evidence here."
Judy,"She neither resembles nor sings like Garland, but Zellweger nails her style and soul. And that glorious wit."
Judy,"Judy is mostly a pleasure, even in its most tense moments, especially because [Renée] Zellweger performs several full numbers that give you a sense of the magic [Judy] Garland brought to the stage."
Judy,"Renée Zellweger is now considered an Oscar front-runner for her performance as Judy Garland in Judy. She is excellent, and it's nice to see her back onscreen. I only wish the film was nearly as good as she is."
Judy,"With the exception of the occasional bout of Jim Bailey trout pout, Renée Zellweger's Judy Garland in Judy convinces in close-up. But did they have to let her sing?"
Judy,"Zellweger's total immersion in the performance, as with Garland, it so vital and impossible to look away from that it transcends the limits of the material she outshines."
Judy,"""Judy"" is not exactly Renee Zellweger's comeback vehicle, but it might as well be. And delivering a devastating, heart-breaking performance as a woman who made a career out of comebacks is the best kind of poetic justice."
Judy,"Renée Zellweger returns to the screen ablaze, singing as if her life depends on it."
Judy,"Renée Zellweger is over the rainbow and out of this world as Judy Garland in ""Judy,"" a sweet, full-hearted tribute to the beloved screen legend's final days."
Judy,"""Judy"" is just such a sturdy, dependable vehicle which, in this case, carries the precious cargo of Renée Zellweger in a dazzling portrayal of Judy Garland at the end of her life."
Judy,"Somehow, Zellweger manages to be Judy for a full two hours, delivering an over-the-rainbow performance in a movie that otherwise, on balance, is a bit more Kansas than Oz."
Judy,"It is sad, but it's not grim because Zellweger's utterly convincing performance shows that Judy was hilarious, self-deprecating, an affectionate mom and a loyal friend."
Judy,"Renée Zellweger may not be Judy Garland, but she reminds us that technical perfection is no match for emotional truth."
Judy,"Renée Zellweger performs miracles playing Judy Garland: singing her heart out, baring her bruised soul and acting with a ferocity that ultimately rises to a state of grace."
Judy,"Zellweger paints shadows of nuance into her portrayal of a performer who invites easy caricature. And she sings, too."
Judy,"""JUDY"" IS A MOVIE OF GROTESQUE SENTIMENTALITY, and I know that sounds like a bad thing, but hear me out."
Judy,"[Renée] Zellweger gives a fearless performance in this movie. She captures the essence of [Judy] Garland with such immersive nuance that the line between the actor and the role doesn't only disappear, it's as if it never existed."
Judy,"Despite its flaws, ""Judy"" can leave you feeling like an emotional wreck by the end."
Judy,"What's most appealing about Zellweger's portrayal is the brightness that peeps out from the clouds: her deep love for her children, her sly wit."
Judy,"A heart-stopping performance by Zellweger, who leaves it all on the floorboards as one of Hollywood's most dazzling and tragic stars."
Judy,"""Judy "" is itself a fine and imperfect look at some of Garland's last years of life, but it really should have been something transcendent - Zellweger's performance demands it."
Judy,"It's heart-rending, to be sure, but also tragically predictable in format."
Judy,"There's never a feeling that Zellweger's ""doing"" Judy; she's being Judy."
Judy,"Wholly embracing Garland's freneticism at its rawest might have registered as excessive or campy, but it would have deepened the portrait. So would Garland's voice."
Judy,"Its trump card, of course, is Zellweger, who blows through the film in a gust of jittery energy, wounded ego and half-buried star quality."
Judy,"It's a nuanced, complex, nakedly emotional performance that digs into the darkest psychology of one of our most beloved stars, and demands that, even in her lowest moments, we could never count Judy Garland out. The same goes for Renee Zellweger."
Judy,"With all the taste, sensitivity and effort at work in ""Judy,"" how could the filmmakers believe that karaoke night at the pub could possibly stand in for one of the best and most distinct vocalists of the 20th century?"
Judy,"The movie's pretty good; though she's hardly alone, Zellweger makes it worth seeing."
Judy,"It might be a little too early to start engraving golden men, but Zellweger proves as vital as ever in her most essential role."
Judy,"Tom Edge's script, based on a play by Peter Quilter, lapses into clichés, but the dialogue is often sharp, and Zellweger offers it up with flair and fury."
Judy,"Renée Zellweger [gives] a breathtaking, transformative performance as the title star, infusing the pathos and humanity into her performance that the script can't seem to find."
Judy,Zellweger's poise and presence make the entire affair more than worthwhile.
Judy,"Renée Zellweger can reach all the notes and hit all the marks, but Garland's high-tension-wire emoting eludes her."
Judy,"This is a solid interpretation of a life everyone knew would be cut short, while garnering millions of fans along the way. Very sweet. Quite tragic."
Judy,"Try as she might, Zellweger's Judy never goes beyond an impression of the multi-talented artist; her all-caps version of acting fails to allow the role to feel natural."
Judy,Zellweger walks the tight rope between joy and anguish so gracefully in her performance that it will leave you enchanted.
Judy,"Zellweger beautifully captures the integrity of Garland's will to entertain. Your heart aches knowing she'll never get the happily ever after she's dreamed of, but it also puts great emphasis on the value of the experiences had while reaching for it."
Judy,"With a jaw-dropping performance from Renée Zellweger at its pulsing, neurotic heart, the film is funny, warm and satisfyingly self-aware."
Judy,"No matter how well you know ""Over the Rainbow,"" you may never hear it as heartbreakingly performed as Zellweger sings it here."
Judy,"Renée Zellweger wasn't the obvious choice to play the late Judy Garland, the joyful Wizard of Oz ingénue turned adult captive of addiction and anxiety, but she makes it seem like there's no place like her home."
Judy,"This is one of those solo turns where the star performance matters more than the story, and Renee Zellweger, playing the legendary singer Judy Garland in her sad last months - broke, anxious, drunk, rueful, but still in it - gives it everything she's got."
Judy,"The movie, directed by Rupert Goold, is a conventional but perfectly serviceable showcase for its star, who sets the whole thing on fire every time she launches into a Garland classic in her own voice."
Judy,"Zellweger... subsumes herself completely in the role, without ever tipping over into some kind of gestural Judy drag."
Judy,"The best thing about Judy, perhaps, is that while it focuses overly on the tragedy of her late career... it is nevertheless a compelling document of a woman who constantly gave of herself."
Judy,"Garland's legacy may be tricky to recreate, her legacy perhaps too large for any biopic to contain, but the music speaks for itself."
Judy,"It's Judy squared, and is the stuff of breathless podium speeches and standing ovations. And even if there is a cynical hint of ""Oscar bait"" about the role, it doesn't make it any less spectacular on screen."
Judy,"Judy is an enjoyable, sincere attempt to present a multi-faceted portrait of a Hollywood legend, bolstered by a strong Renée Zellweger."
Judy,Zellweger rises smartly to the occasion. Perhaps there's a few too many of those tight little Bridget Jones moues she's fond of... but her particular stamp on this role makes more and more sense as the film goes on.
Judy,"Renee Zellweger gives the performance of her career in a film which is certainly an awards-friendly biopic, but strikes a darker, more maudlin note than expected."
Judy,"Goold's movie sometimes stumbles, but it made one indispensable choice in finding the right actress to channel the diva."
Judy,"Renée Zellweger gives us a heartfelt, studied portrayal of Garland."
Judy,"It's gutsy, can't-look-away work, yet it might not enthrall those who evaluate biopic turns as Olympian feats of technical mimicry."
A Thousand and One,"The director maps the contours of a destabilised existence. It is one thing to put us in Terry and Inez’s shoes, quite another to make us feel, as Rockwell does, the ground shifting unpredictably beneath them."
A Thousand and One,"Come for Taylor’s breakout performance, stay for a tender, confidently told story of Black motherhood and sacrifice. Rockwell is one to watch."
A Thousand and One,The directorial debut from AV Rockwell is rather special.
A Thousand and One,[A] heartfelt melodrama that consistently sparks and sputters without ever fully igniting.
A Thousand and One,"The delicately pitched performances, luminous cinematography and quiet, jazzy score counteract [any] excess, creating a stately feel that’s rare in stories of contemporary urban suffering."
A Thousand and One,"Sacrifice is the critical ingredient in survival for those of us who grew up Black and poor, and this film knocks that fact out of the park, so well that the act of sacrifice becomes kind of a character."
A Thousand and One,Teyana Taylor shines in a tale of the past that feels no less relevant and affecting today.
A Thousand and One,"Character portraits just don't come sharper than ""A Thousand And One."""
A Thousand and One,"A Thousand and One is rich and complex, the saga of someone battling to build a family and a stable home with no real experience of what that looks like."
A Thousand and One,"Rockwell has made a humanistic epic – really, it could be a filmed novel – and brings it to life through empathy, subtle shadings, and a central figure and performance that won’t be denied."
A Thousand and One,"A Thousand and One is an auspicious debut for Rockwell. And it’s a thrilling evolution for Taylor, who puts her My Super Sweet 16 days very far in the rearview."
A Thousand and One,"It’s a reasonably compelling premise for a movie. A Thousand and One, however, does very little with it."
A Thousand and One,Overcomes those touches of first-time filmmaker gimmickry with incredibly moving performances and a focus on the love it takes to help people up from difficult circumstances.
A Thousand and One,Rockwell's script and direction rejects melodrama and is grounded in tangible feelings and reality.
A Thousand and One,"[Teyana]Taylor... is incredible in a demanding role. Inez often behaves badly, but Taylor doesn't court our favor, secure in the knowledge that we'll care for her character because she is doing the best she can."
A Thousand and One,"The film is utterly absorbing, anchored by the at times unpredictable performance of Taylor, playing a hopelessly complicated, but deeply caring woman."
A Thousand and One,Rockwell’s depiction of a rapidly gentrifying city is the film’s crowning achievement.
A Thousand and One,"It’s a small movie only in the most pedestrian sense: It’s intimate, humanly scaled and concerns ordinary people with ordinary struggles."
A Thousand and One,This is not a movie that will leave you feeling especially warm and fuzzy -- it is often devastating. But it’s also bursting with hope for the future in this deeply human story.
A Thousand and One,"It’s Taylor’s performance as the loyal, determined Inez that gives the picture its heart and soul."
A Thousand and One,"First-time feature director A.V. Rockwell, working from her own script, tells an epic tale in miniature."
A Thousand and One,"The way that A Thousand and One consistently swerves into less absolutist, more emotionally complicated territory without sacrificing the joy or pain of these characters is what sets this movie apart from a thousand other similar stories."
A Thousand and One,None of this comes off as didactic; Rockwell deftly weaves her commentary into a story that turns out to be less conventional and more surprising than it looks.
A Thousand and One,"Wisely locating her characters at the intersection of race, class and gender, Rockwell takes stock of their losses and challenges, their joys and moments of respite, all within a city that is indifferent to them."
A Thousand and One,"A Thousand and One sounds like it will break your heart, and often it does. But it isn’t despairing nor does it lack hope, even when it takes a disorienting but well-played turn."
A Thousand and One,"This is a tough, beautiful, honest and bracingly hopeful movie about mutual care and unconditional love, with a transformative and indelible performance at its core."
A Thousand and One,"A passionate panorama of political obstacles to personal achievement, the inseparability of private life from public power."
A Thousand and One,A Thousand and One brims with authenticity and the electrifying emotional intensity of the best melodramas.
A Thousand and One,"Director and screenwriter A.V. Rockwell’s lens captures the beauty and vibrancy of the city of New York, Black life, and motherhood in poverty..."
A Thousand and One,This modest drama resists easy happy endings that are far out of reach for this luckless but resilient family.
A Thousand and One,"We have seen dozens of stories about single mothers who overcome adversity, but the narrative here makes it feel new again as we feel Inez’s tough decisions and how they shape Terry’s worldview."
A Thousand and One,Watching a ferociously protective and streetwise mother try to beat the system and raise a son who will have more opportunities than she is so compelling. Taylor's searing portrayal of that woman is Oscar-worthy.
A Thousand and One,It’s Taylor who anchors Rockwell’s direction and screenplay with her powerhouse performance.
A Thousand and One,"While “A Thousand and One” is a breathtakingly beautiful portrait of Black womanhood and is thoughtfully political, the character beats heave with a noticeable unevenness."
A Thousand and One,"A Thousand and One is a character study of one woman’s choices, her love for her son, and the countless obstacles she encounters just getting through the minutia of her life. It is vivid and gutting."
A Thousand and One,"Rockwell uses the full range of cinematic expressivity to turn a small, often tragic story of raw deals and rash decisions into an admiring portrait of survivorship, determination and resourcefulness."
A Thousand and One,Well-acted and compelling.
A Thousand and One,"A Thousand and One is a love letter to mothers, sons, daughters, the hustlers, and displaced of New York City."
Ordinary Love,"This touching, beautifully observed story shows us that love is never ordinary as a long-time couple try to find a way to support each other when the wife gets breast cancer. Lesley Manville gives an performance of exquisite sensitivity."
Ordinary Love,"A lovely, understated thing."
Ordinary Love,Don't expect dramatic fireworks - very little happens narratively - but prepare for this quiet film to tiptoe into your heart.
Ordinary Love,"I hated this film. I hated every minute of it, and at times it even made me angry."
Ordinary Love,"A veritable primer on how to come through a crisis without being crushed under the weight of sentimentality. In Hollywood terms, there is nothing ordinary about this love story."
Ordinary Love,This is a movie about resignation and perseverance and the non-showy essence of life and love.
Ordinary Love,"There are other strains at artistic-ness like this - a series of rooms revisited when they are empty, a goldfish that exists so that it may die, a dream sequence that seems to switch from first-person to third-person perspective."
Ordinary Love,An engaging and well-acted drama that finds catharsis and hope in a terrible personal ordeal.
Ordinary Love,"Despite strong performances by Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, the domestic drama offers little beyond recounting the steps of diagnosis and treatment."
Ordinary Love,"But here's the thing: Joan and Tom do come back from it. The couples who stay together figure out how to do that. Ordinary Love is an argument that, as hard as that is, it's worth it."
Ordinary Love,It's a bit like having a front row seat at being human.
Ordinary Love,"""Ordinary Love"" is not a movie solely about cancer. It is a raw, on-screen adaptation of what hundreds of couples experience when their limits are tested - physically, mentally and romantically."
Ordinary Love,"The film is too in denial of that tension to make anything meaningful from it. Still, there's something to be said for a movie that shines a light into matters of the heart without having to break yours completely."
Ordinary Love,"There's a generic aspect to it that I found off-putting for a film that touches so many nerves, but it is wonderful to see these two actors."
Ordinary Love,"Traditionally, audiences avoid movies about nice people bravely battling terminal illnesses by the millions. Can two stars this viable and magnetic erase the stigma?"
Ordinary Love,"Manville has to go through a kaleidoscope of moods and emotions, and every one of them is precise, fearless, and searingly real."
Ordinary Love,"Unlike most others of its kind, this one trusts us to stick with the slew of treatments that often hurt more than the disease. In its cheekily Irish way it offers a portrait of a great and enduring love under acute pressure."
Ordinary Love,The film's strength lies in the performances -- two fine actors elevating their roles from the touchingly mundane to the suddenly momentous.
Ordinary Love,"Manville's gifts and accomplishments are no surprise, but she's never been better than she is here."
Ordinary Love,It's just a shame that extraordinary talents can't redeem an ordinary film.
Ordinary Love,"As persuasive as the performers can be, Tom and Joan seem less real the more time you spend with them."
Ordinary Love,"A beautifully understated look at intimacy and devotion in the face of potentially devastating loss; stars Leslie Manville and Liam Neeson tap effortlessly into the relatable routines, rhythms and nuances of a lived-in, long term relationship."
Ordinary Love,"The message of Ordinary Love is less that one's partner is a rock, and rather that despite our loved one's best efforts, we're all on this journey alone."
Ordinary Love,Ignore the unassuming title: Ordinary Love is a love story that is extraordinary.
Ordinary Love,You'll feel nothing but fondness for your surroundings after watching this scaldingly fine romance.
Ordinary Love,"Just so perfectly judged, and I'm a big fan of these filmmakers. The script is terrific, and a lovely, ambient score..."
Ordinary Love,"Sure, it's sometimes tough going, but the hardship and fear are laced with wit, warmth and a comforting sense of authenticity."
Ordinary Love,"The performances... are simply flawless, with particular plaudits to Manville, for whom awards are surely due."
Ordinary Love,"Not very Christmassy, you might think, but it's not a 'cancer story', as has been said in some quarters, it's a love story, told profoundly and beautifully and honestly rather than cloyingly or sentimentally."
Ordinary Love,"The unremarkable nature of this story becomes its strength, but the modest, well-acted virtues of the piece could have resonated profoundly with a little more detail."
Ordinary Love,"This cancer drama is earnest, gripping, well acted, sometimes harrowing. But simultaneously it's a TV play making honourable bids to escape into a bigger acoustic of style and theme."
Ordinary Love,"Anchored by great performances from Liam Neeson and especially Lesley Manville, Ordinary Love is alive to the feelings and moments other hospital dramas overlook."
Ordinary Love,"Ordinary Love runs the risk of being almost too 'ordinary'. However, watching these two great actors bend their immense talents to playing unremarkable people creates something quietly extraordinary."
Ordinary Love,There's a push and pull between two great actors that keeps the air between them charged.
Ordinary Love,"And although there are some slightly stereotypical weepie moments, the film has a strong sense of emotional purpose and Manville and Neeson - perhaps especially Manville - bring conviction and force."
Ordinary Love,"Very little happens on the surface of Owen McCafferty's script, as everything life or death is taking place inside Manville."
Ordinary Love,"An achingly intimate portrait of a marriage weathering a storm, the third feature from directing team Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn (Good Vibrations) is anything but ordinary."
Ordinary Love,Ravagingly honest and quite lovely.
Living,A singular moment that comes riding on such a lifelike performance from Nighy that it doesn’t seem like acting at all.
Living,The movie is a slow-burn that never accelerates but Bill Nighy’s performance makes it a compelling experience.
Living,"The film itself is like eating a rich dessert: you marvel at all the constituent parts, but when it’s over, you may have regrets. It is lush and richly textured, like the old colour footage of London that we see in the credits, but just a little pushy."
Living,"It is a little cold at first but you know, when it opens up, I cried, and I have no shame about that."
Living,"A little movie about big topics, Living takes on nothing less than life itself and features a quiet, note-perfect performance from Bill Nighy."
Living,The quietly powerful Living defies expectations at every turn.
Living,"Living is even further removed from the The Death of Ivan Ilyich than Kurosawa's film. It is even smaller and more intimate, and much of its suppressed wonder comes from a career-best performance from Nighy."
Living,"Hermanus' film is as reserved as its main character. It draws us in by viewing Williams at a respectful remove, in the same way a whisper encourages us to lean in to hear."
Living,What I appreciate about this movie is how it's really about inertia... and it doesn't pretend inertia is easy to defeat.
Living,I love this film. Probably one of my favorites of the year.
Living,"Like the best of novels — one of Ishiguro’s, for example — it creates a tiny world to get lost in, one whose faces and shadows and sunlight linger with you, ever after you’ve returned to your own."
Living,"[It] should not work. Yet it does, ultimately, thanks to the magnificent talents of its leading man, Bill Nighy."
Living,"Without Nighy’s refined performance as Mr. Williams, Living’s lasting impact would be fleeting, but his embodiment of revival, despite incurable limitations, gives this film an unlikely opening to redemption."
Living,Nighy makes it look effortless; he gives an Oscar-worthy performance that made me cry almost as much as Takashi Shimura did in Kurosawa’s classic.
Living,"A worthy reimagining of Kurosawa’s drama—and one that features, courtesy of star Bill Nighy, as superb a performance as you’re likely to see in 2022."
Living,"Throughout, Bill Nighy carries the film effortlessly on his slender shoulders, reminding us of why he's an international treasure."
Living,"“Living” gets where it needs to go, and gets its characters where they need to be, in its own good time."
Living,Living mostly avoids sappiness. And it shows an actor at the peak of his powers.
Living,"Rather than shake us to our core like Ikiru, Living teaches us a life lesson we can all agree on. It's like an Afterschool Special for grownups — a very good one, mind you."
Living,"This wise and moving drama is an existential journey that celebrates learning how to live life, in all its fleeting beauty."
Living,"National treasure Bill Nighy finally gets his shot at Oscars glory as a repressed civil servant in this immaculate British drama, penned by Sir Kazuo Ishiguro."
Living,"The highest compliment I can pay Living is that it takes those dusty ideas and makes them resonate once more. Not unlike remembering an old, familiar song, and understanding it for the first time."
Living,"Living isn't a great movie—it's a little too subdued at times, and has a tendency to fixate on Williams' mostly unarticulated sadness—but it's consistently involving."
Living,"When our eyes begin to well up with tears toward the soulful ending, we’re as surprised and self-reflective as the characters are."
Living,"The dryness of “Living,” to its credit, avoids [sentimentality], and, overall, has trimmed Kurosawa’s tale into a more focused 102 minutes. But there’s a stale emptiness to Living that doesn’t entirely dissipate in even its most moving scenes."
Living,"It’s a film that steps back to consider the rituals and routines we perpetuate, the ways we’ve changed since the last break. And the ways we haven’t."
Living,"A gentle, expertly crafted meditation on dying and, of course, living."
Living,"Within emotional parameters that other actors might have found gloomily constricting, Nighy coaxes forth a tour de force of understatement, suffused with an almost musical melancholy."
Living,"Living is not quite as good as Akira Kurosawa’s Ikiru (of which it is a remake), but it’s a damn good re-interpretation."
Living,"An extraordinarily wise and touching exploration of the most profound of existential questions, literally the meaning of life. It is superb in every detail, with a heartbreakingly beautiful performance from Bill Nighy."
Living,So compelling are Nighy and Burke that I will watch them in anything...
Living,"Bill Nighy delivers a master class in acting as a stifled Brit bureaucrat who decides to seize the day before it's too late. Working in miniature to achieve major truths, this deeply human drama has the power to sneak up and knock you sideways."
Living,The cast is wonderful. And every detail – from Sandy Powell’s exquisite period costumes to Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch’s music – is just perfect. A final exchange with a passing policeman would make a stone cry.
Living,Addresses weighty matters of life and death with a winning simplicity that is hard to resist.
Living,"[Bill Nighy] has shed his trademark, twinkling charisma like snakeskin. What lies beneath is something almost spectral in its stillness"
Living,"The sort of highly crafted, intensely calculated kind of middlebrow-that-thinks-it’s-highbrow fare that wins awards."
Living,"It is as profoundly and deeply felt as the original and as heartbreakingly tender. It asks the same question, but this time with Englishness, bowler hats, the sweet trolley at Fortnum’s and Bill Nighy. Really, what more could you want?"
Living,"Really quite something: a rare remake that only augments and enriches the original. For Bill Nighy, meanwhile, it feels in every sense like the role of a lifetime."
Living,Nighy deserves big love at all the awards ceremonies that matter in 2023.
Living,"It’s a great minimalist performance by Nighy, making the smallest escape of emotion significant -- and it works because you know just how quirky and scene-stealing Nighy can be when not thus repressed."
Living,Living has the feel of a film afraid to fully step out of its predecessor’s giant shadow.
Living,"Deeply felt films that look past today’s disputes remain rare, which is why Living is so refreshing."
Living,Taking a tiny slice of life and letting it segue into a life-affirming metamorphosis takes real skill.
Living,"Imbued with realistic hope and filled with rich period details, it reminds us all to live in the present before it’s too late."
Living,"Living -- which looks like it was made in the 1950s, all film grain and vibrance -- is an immensely moving memento mori, anchored by Nighy’s breathtaking performance, and a call to live a life with purpose."
Living,"Nighy is magnetic, heartbreaking and utterly unforgettable. Movies have become classics for less."
Living,"These elements are also in the service of aiding and abetting a performance, however, which is what genuinely makes Living vital and unmissable."
Living,"Sentimental but never cloying, Living is an elegant elegy, a reminder to take little in life for granted -- and to forgive the times when that lesson gets overlooked."
Living,"The beautiful outcome in both form and spirit makes ""Living"" an instant classic. Get out your handkerchiefs!"
Living,"A moving elegy on the value of life based on one of the best films ever made, Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru."
Living,"""Living"" is undeniably moving, although perhaps not to the same degree that Kurosawa achieved..."
Living,Nighy has never been better than in this richly rewarding '50s-set drama about a repressed and terminally ill man who discovers life just as it comes to an end.
Living,"True to Ikiru, this is a low-key tale that hinges on a humble act, and Living honors the sense of discovery engendered by its structure"
Living,A decent -though not extravagant - watch.
Living,A director rising into the highest ranks and an actor at the peak of his powers are the keys to this mesmerising melodrama set in London in the 1950s.
Living,Nighy gives one of the finest (not to say subtlest) performances of his career to date.
Living,"A sturdy and thoughtful drama, anchored by a moving lead performance from Bill Nighy and elevated by a handsome sense of style."
Living,"[A] handsome, high quality adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Ikiru (To Live)."
Living,"A gentle, exquisitely sad film."
Yellow Rose,Noblezada has great pipes and a natural screen presence that augurs well for her future career.
Yellow Rose,"""Yellow Rose"" sings an affecting, sorrowful and defiant song where dreams collide with a cruel reality."
Yellow Rose,"Diane Paragas' film finds fresh ground to explore the price and the power of the American dream, bolstered by country crooning and heartbreaking (and very real) legal worries."
Yellow Rose,"Yellow Rose succeeds not only as a coming-of-age story for the ambitious Rose, but also as an exploration of the very real threat weathered every day by the undocumented."
Yellow Rose,"As an undocumented Filipina trying to make it in as a country singer in Texas, breakout star Eva Noblezada punches through the film's familiar contours to find its beating heart as a timely portrait of the immigrant experience."
Yellow Rose,There's an honesty that Diane Paragas brings to this that I really respect.
Yellow Rose,It feels like such a quintessentially American tale as well as a story that we haven't seen before.
Yellow Rose,"Tells the story in the broadest strokes possible, and the lack of specificity undercuts the film's impact."
Yellow Rose,"Paragas strings too many variables on the story, most of which require a more thorough inquiry than they get."
Yellow Rose,A sweetly earnest character study and coming-of-age tale that's impressive because of its low-key authenticity.
Yellow Rose,What we are left with is a true and honest account of how quickly the lives of millions change overnight.
Yellow Rose,"""Yellow Rose"" is ultimately a film about kindness. The world can be cruel, but the film's characters tend not to be."
Yellow Rose,Writer-director Diane Paragas spins a story that is both politically timely and personal.
Yellow Rose,"Yellow Rose may not be a success on the whole, but it does suggest that Paragas, like her protagonist, is still finding her way."
Yellow Rose,"An affecting portrayal of a young woman finding her footing against all odds, and claiming her home in a nation that makes it unduly challenging."
Yellow Rose,The lean screenplay and [Diane] Paragas' focused creative vision makes for a singular directorial feature debut that feels like nothing else happening in film right now.
Yellow Rose,Affecting on almost every level.
Tulsa,ERROR
A Hidden Life,ERROR
Dark Waters,A tale of the horrors caused by capitalism and how it empowers people into other avenues of corruption...
Dark Waters,"Dark Waters is as gripping as it is terrifying, and it'll claw into your consciousness in the same way that poisonous forever chemicals have claimed squatter's rights in your body."
Dark Waters,"...by focusing on the individuals involved, and laying out a compelling moral vision, Dark Waters also works as a powerful metaphor for those cases when persistence and compassion have pushed society forward."
Dark Waters,"The groundswell of dogged determination propelling this environmental thriller is so powerful that it deals effortlessly with the knotty tangle of facts packed into its plot. Much of this is down to the film's star and initiator, Mark Ruffalo."
Dark Waters,The subject deserved better.
Dark Waters,Ruffalo's performance alone is worth the price of a ticket...
Dark Waters,"The film fizzes with righteous fury right the way through to its bitter, unhappy ending."
Dark Waters,"In Dark Waters, [Todd Haynes] bathes his audience in pure terror like very few other directors could."
Dark Waters,"Haynes presents a sedate yet immeasurably precise court-room drama, which seems far less concerned with the minutiae of the story itself than with Billot's own redemptive arc"
Dark Waters,"True to its title, this is a murky pool of a movie, and Mark Ruffalo is the man on the bank, poking its surface with a stick."
Dark Waters,A movie that works marvellously well within its own generic terms...
Dark Waters,"The Bilotts make compelling viewing, straight arrows losing the scales from their eyes."
Dark Waters,Already depressed that modern life is killing us all? Prepare not to be cheered up.
Dark Waters,"This one stays with you, tightly-coiled and quietly horrifying."
Dark Waters,"A bizarrely strait-laced project for Todd Haynes, Dark Waters lacks dramatic oomph but compensates via a well-mounted telling of a terrifying story, driven by still contemporary concerns and a convincing central turn by Mark Ruffalo."
Dark Waters,Mark Ruffalo gives one of his best performances in a long time in this movie.
Dark Waters,It's the rare American film that trusts in both the intelligence and patience of its audience.
Dark Waters,Ruffalo and Haynes have stripped away a significant proportion of what makes their work distinctive in what looks like a mistaken opinion that style is not serious.
Dark Waters,"Bilott's story is a serious one and demands a responsible retelling. Fortunately, Haynes finds a way to do so without mistaking such a weighty task as an excuse to be plodding or bone-dry procedural."
Dark Waters,"It's a David and Goliath story with a central figure who knows what's right and keeps chipping away, bit by bit, until he gets to the truth."
Dark Waters,It's enough to make you want to chuck all of your non-stick and waterproofed products after seeing this movie.
Dark Waters,"Yet Dark Waters really makes absolute sense. [Todd] Haynes looks for the poison in the heartland, whether it be homophobia, racism, or domestic violence. In this case... it's literal poison."
Dark Waters,Robert is every bit as determined as any underdog attorney in recent movie history.
Dark Waters,Haynes also provides a sense of crushing dread-the kind of unsolvable paranoia these procedure-bound movies usually work to counter.
Dark Waters,"""Dark Waters"" doesn't aspire to be something it's not. Like Bilott himself, it gets the job done, not by showboating, but by laying out the facts."
Dark Waters,"It's not flashy, but it's how you get the job done."
Dark Waters,"All of this works, for the most part, but only occasionally surprises."
Dark Waters,"The brilliance of ""Dark Waters"" is that it is able to lay out the case against DuPont without getting too wonky."
Dark Waters,"Beyond the fundamental horror of corporate greed trumping public-health concerns, the movie -- while often bleak and unsettling -- does find hope in the idea that one ordinary guy can make a difference."
Dark Waters,"Mark Ruffalo, a great actor of seemingly limitless range, brings a growing sense of moral outrage to this gripping Todd Haynes docudrama about a corporate lawyer who risks it all to take on the chemical companies he's been hired to defend."
Dark Waters,Strong and involving.
Dark Waters,The bad guys have all the money but at least we have indie filmmakers and movie stars like Ruffalo.
Dark Waters,"Ruffalo is one of the movie's producers, and he demonstrates his devotion to the project by receding into the role of the rumpled attorney."
Dark Waters,"It's a perfect movie, and not the least of its power is due to Ruffalo's flawless performance."
Dark Waters,"Dark Waters is Mr. Ruffalo's film, both in its gestation and execution, and his passion has been well served."
Dark Waters,"Seeing ""Dark Waters"" makes you wonder not why more people don't call corporations to account, but why anyone does. And makes us all the more grateful when they do."
Dark Waters,It's exceedingly well executed and technically impeccable...
Dark Waters,"It's perhaps a familiar script: good cause, inspiration movie. ""Dark Waters"" distinguishes itself, however, in intricately following the story of a toxic substance, from a West Virginia backwater to ubiquity."
Dark Waters,"While I hope, for his next project, that he's back on the less conventional, more stylish Haynes train, I'm glad we got to see what a Todd Haynes courtroom drama looked like."
Dark Waters,"As a drama, it's patchy but as a document, it's undeniable."
Dark Waters,"A movie with a story as urgent as this needn't look lovely, and yet Dark Waters often does, finding beautiful patterns and motifs in the quotidian stuff of folders and desk lamps and stacks of paper."
Dark Waters,"As a means of delivering information, Dark Waters is extraordinary and righteously infuriating."
Dark Waters,"Todd Haynes's artistry is hardly detectable in this environmental thriller, yet the film, based on a true story, nonetheless offers a stirring and infuriating story of brazen corporate indifference to employees, neighbors, and the world at large."
Dark Waters,Of course we all hate insidious environmental destruction; it's valuable to have movies about that. This one works fine enough. But let the other less-talented filmmakers make them.
Dark Waters,Haynes's film intermittently hits upon a few original ways of representing its ripped-from-the-headlines mandate.
Dark Waters,"As a portrait of solitary dedication against impossible odds, it's of a piece with Haynes's female-centered stories of upstream defiance Safe and Far From Heaven as much as a Spotlight or All the President's Men."
Dark Waters,"While ""Dark Waters"" chronicles the evolution of an activist, its most effective moment comes with a closing implication that its story has just begun."
Dark Waters,"Dark Waters would likely have been a forgettable mediocrity in anybody's hands, given its fact-based, muckraking limitations. Coming from the visionary who gave us Safe, Far From Heaven, I'm Not There, and Carol, it's a crushing disappointment."
Dark Waters,"A consistently strong, tight legal drama which brings to mind the very best of its kind..."
Dark Waters,"It's a decent movie in its own grim, doggedly determined way, and inarguably a story worth telling, but delivered in beats that too often feel both workmanlike and overly familiar."
Dark Waters,It's a sad but honest view of the meager amount many people can expect from life.
Dark Waters,Todd Haynes has made the first corporate thriller that's a call to action because you'll emerge from it feeling anything but safe.
Kajillionaire,"Kajillionaire is funny, original, sad and singular. In other words, it's Peak Miranda July."
Kajillionaire,"Bleak and funny and still, somehow, flickering with hope."
Kajillionaire,"The chemistry between Rodriguez and Wood is undeniable, and Rodriguez's more naturalistic performance balances out her costar's affected shuffling and deep, gravely monotone."
Kajillionaire,Kajillionaire takes a heartbreaking story - a child of abuse trying to escape her sociopathic parents - and bloats it so full of Little Miss Sunshine kook that any emotional sharpness is left soft and doughy.
Kajillionaire,"""Kajillionaire"" keeps getting sidetracked by its own offbeats, resulting in an experience that's equal parts endearing and exasperating."
Kajillionaire,"The film's sparkiest revelation is Rodriguez, almost spectacularly charming and skilled as an ingénue schemer with more life experience than she's letting on."
Kajillionaire,"Kajillionaire is one of the weirdest films I have seen of late...this is a compliment, not a criticism."
Kajillionaire,"Oddities abound in July's gently absurdist films; you either roll with it or not. But when you give in, you go through them childlike, experiencing real and surreal together."
Kajillionaire,"This is comedy wed not just to melancholy but to a deep sense, maybe fear, of failure."
Kajillionaire,"July has made her best feature. Four fine actors ... make the most of tricky, slippery material. On out-there triumph."
Kajillionaire,"Kajillionaire won't make anyone rich, but who cares?"
Kajillionaire,"Miranda July's films are miniature fairytales played out of tune - whimsical and sweet, with a tartness right at their centre."
Kajillionaire,"On relationships, July remains as perceptive as ever."
Kajillionaire,"Almost everything on camera is ""wacky"" with a screamingly conspicuous capital W."
Kajillionaire,"Kajillionaire has a harder edge than July's earlier pictures, with something bleaker and more ironic in the surrealism."
Kajillionaire,"""Kajillionaire"" is a rich piece of storytelling, and it feels like a kajillion bucks."
Kajillionaire,"The unexpected pleasure of Kajillionaire is that, with the singsong delivery dialled down just a notch, you can hear yourself think long enough to decide."
Kajillionaire,"Not quite a critique of the adorable whimsy of her early work, Kajillionaire is a head-on encounter with the psychic tensions that always undergirded it."
Kajillionaire,"There is such a delightful and odd sweetness to the friendship that develops between Evan Rachel Wood and Gina Rodriguez... It's a really weird movie, but also a really sweet and human one."
Kajillionaire,"Kajillionaire is a movie about love, and loneliness, and it's funny and bittersweet and beautiful."
Kajillionaire,"It has a breezier, more relaxed vibe than either of July's earlier movies thanks to one glorious, effervescent performance: when Gina Rodriguez appears, she turns the picture around..."
Kajillionaire,"Bit by bit, line by line, [July] nudges you onto her characters' wavelength, navigating their world with matter-of-fact drollery and tethering even her weirdest flights of fancy to clear, accessible emotions."
Kajillionaire,"""Kajillionaire"" is a ferociously sharp-minded movie about parents and children, about families and their bonds, about family unity and its place in the world."
Kajillionaire,The way July is able to juggle both the slyly cruel circumstances and the genuinely heartfelt transformation makes this her best work yet: a fractured mirror fable broken into perfect pieces.
Kajillionaire,"Things take a remarkable turn toward the end, but getting there requires patience with the film's insistent style, and with slow-burn, deadpan sequences that qualify as absurd but aren't all that lively."
Kajillionaire,"I've heard ""Kajillionaire"" described as a coming-of-age movie, which doesn't seem quite right. It's more like a coming-alive movie, and a gorgeous one at that."
Kajillionaire,"By the end, it all feels like life-affirming stuff."
Kajillionaire,"Before watching the oddly titled ""Kajillionaire,"" I had thought myself immune to the appeal of Miranda July's strange and excessively whimsical movies."
Kajillionaire,"Funny, poignant and ultimately triumphant, ""Kajillionaire"" is a precarious balancing act, one that July pulls off with astute writing, careful staging and trust in her actors..."
Kajillionaire,"In its quizzical, candy-coloured, sideways view of the world - one that normalizes apartments that regularly flood with pink sludge - the film is offering a challenge to its audience."
Kajillionaire,"As gloomy as all of this may sound, July invests it with a lively energy that avoids a spiral into darkness and depression, no matter how bad things get."
Kajillionaire,"With this strange, dark dramedy, July reminds us that walls can never retain the softest parts of ourselves yearning to break free."
Kajillionaire,The precarity and itinerant lifestyle of the central figures in Kajillionaire can be seen as a logical next step in Miranda July's filmmaking trajectory.
Kajillionaire,"""Kajillionaire"" is hyperbolic and surreal, but also, with July's unique touch, sweet."
Kajillionaire,"On a scene-by-scene and minute-by-minute basis, it is always at least a little bit interesting and different."
Kajillionaire,"July uses ""Kajillionaire"" to present her credentials as a transcendentalist of the humdrum."
Kajillionaire,"A beautifully bizarre film whose considerable strangeness allows for sharp observations about family, loneliness and the terror of emotional intimacy, Kajillionaire is further proof of writer-director Miranda July's ability to bend reality to her will."
Kajillionaire,"It's the kind of tale Miranda July specializes in... another distinctive, funny, gently sympathetic portrait of people who are poorly suited for society, but condemned to live in it anyway."
Kajillionaire,"July has a handful of bizarre and heartfelt scenes, but when the film breaks from its narrative course to make more grandiose statements about its prevalent ideas, it feels like it has started speaking in another language."
Kajillionaire,"Most directors not named David Lynch wouldn't be able to handle just one of these aforementioned surreal elements - they'd either overplay it, or underplay it - but July effectively immerses us in this defiantly unpredictable world."
Kajillionaire,"It's a delight to have July back behind the camera, especially with a project as tender and funny as this one..."
Kajillionaire,"The cleverly formulated observations on family ties and interpersonal conflicts that characterize July's style are at hand, though ultimately not in optimal shape."
Kajillionaire,A prickly little gem by a singular artist.
Kajillionaire,"Ever since her letter-based performance work ""Joanie 4 Jackie,"" July has explored the emotional currency of communication, and those themes remain potent here."
Kajillionaire,"In the end, ""Kajillionaire"" is less about the con than it is the connection, and we're all the richer as a result."
Kajillionaire,Event horizon Miranda July in fantastic and also frustrating ways.
Harriet,Cynthia Erivo puts in a potent turn in the title role.
Harriet,[Harriet] takes historical reality and stretches it over the canvas of an old-fashioned adventure story.
Harriet,"It has a central performance that carries the drama shoulder-high. It's gripping, and there's a mystical element to it..."
Harriet,"Ultimately, though, Harriet is impressive, especially given the budget ($17 million)."
Harriet,"So often, historical films are stale and mired in misery, but Harriet has a rare buoyancy."
Harriet,It's a rousing piece of film-making from Lemmons.
Harriet,"The whole package is so sleekly watchable, if risk-averse to a fault, that I can't recall a recent time at the cinema where I learned more by thinking less."
Harriet,"Erivo tears through Harriet, a live wire in the heart of a biography of Harriet Tubman that without her might have risked stateliness."
Harriet,"Erivo's impressive central performance is frequently undercut by an all-too-conventional approach. Hopefully in a few years Tubman can get the definitive biopic she deserves. Sadly, this isn't it."
Harriet,The film is dramatized in a way that neither exaggerates nor lessens Harriet's extremely real struggle-no film can tarnish a legacy so profound.
Harriet,"Thanks to a powerhouse performance from Erivo and stellar direction from filmmaker Kasi Lemmons, biographical drama Harriet frequently lives up to the weight of expectation."
Harriet,"The pint-sized Erivo captures the pint-sized Tubman's determination and fire. And by focusing on the violence slavery did to families, Lemmons makes us feel its outrages afresh."
Harriet,"""Harriet"" often feels in awe of its subject, like it's staring at her through museum glass. There's a better, bolder story to be told from Tubman's life. ""Harriet"" is a start, but it never catches fire."
Harriet,Harriet never feels like a fully formed human being with all the doubts and desires that come with that distinction.
Harriet,"The crackling historical fiction frames her harrowing rescue missions in fast-paced, quick-cut style."
Harriet,"[Cynthia Erivo] is really great, but the film is an unfortunately really safe, by-the-numbers biopic."
Harriet,"Harriet is so consumed with reverence for the patron saint of Black History Month that it neglects to make her, or any of the supporting characters around her, a real person."
Harriet,"Clear, linear, sometimes bluntly obvious, ""Harriet"" is a rich, enlightening portrait - as sturdy and straightforward as the title character herself."
Harriet,"""Harriet"" is a big, conventional Hollywood bio-pic except for the parts that aren't conventional at all... and the movie as a whole is worthy - a stirring if somewhat ham-fisted telling of a life that needs to be known by all Americans."
Harriet,"Though ""Harriet"" falters when it adds increasing amounts of action melodrama to the mix, the truth of Tubman's life, like leading Union soldiers during the Civil War, continues to astonish, as does the performance of the woman who brings her to life."
Harriet,"It's a harrowing, heroic story that comes along at a perfect time, told with a mixture of inspiration and adventure, although sadly lacking an undertone of legendary significance the story of Harriet Tubman deserves."
Harriet,"Try as it might to present her as a kind of pistol-toting Dirty Harriet, this clunky biopic -- directed and co-scripted by Kasi Lemmons -- doesn't come close to doing her justice."
Harriet,"""Harriet"" is the kind of instructional, no-nonsense biopic that may not take many artistic risks or sophisticated stylistic departures but manages to benefit from that lack of pretension."
Harriet,This kind of American history deserves a film like this
Harriet,Lemmons' greatest asset here is undoubtedly the tough-as-nails performance at the heart of her film.
Harriet,"The gospel songs are gorgeously performed and cleverly deployed, but the rest of the soundtrack makes an absolute mess of the film's mood: swoopy where it should be driven, wistful where it should be achingly tense."
Harriet,"""Harriet"" plays more as the kind of movie that would be shown to a high school class studying the pre-Civil War era."
Harriet,"Erivo is incandescent in the role, one of the great performances of the year in a story that is as vital as history as it is timely."
Harriet,"If the movie doesn't burn as brightly as Tubman's legacy, the tale it tells is illuminating nonetheless."
Harriet,Erivo captures both Tubman's defiance and her headstrong courage. But the film overall feels too conventional. It simply cannot fully capture the inspiring story of Tubman's incredible life.
Harriet,"Cynthia Erivo makes a compelling Harriet Tubman in Harriet, a slightly shallow biopic of the American hero."
Harriet,"It is a rousing and powerful drama, respectful of both the historical record and the cravings of modern audiences."
Harriet,"Harriet is an overdue, mostly worthwhile tribute -- one whose main flaw involves dressing up her story more than its real-life heroism requires."
Harriet,"It's hard to go too far wrong, though, with a story as compelling as Tubman's and an actress as vivid as Erivo. Better to celebrate the arrival of what hopefully will be a slew of Tubman films, and look forward to those Tubman bills in our wallets."
Harriet,A conventional but engaging biopic about a crucial American figure.
Harriet,"It's as if Tubman walks among us, melting away the years between her life and ours."
Harriet,"""Harriet"" is a necessary movie - it's shocking it has taken this long for a project on this scale - and, as a director, Lemmons atones for some of her screenplay's flaws."
Harriet,"This Harriet Tubman has become a fierce social warrior, a wonder woman who deserves her own action figure."
Harriet,"Erivo is a standout in this modest, well-intentioned story of courage and inspiration, and is worthy of consideration when Oscar nominations are handed out."
Harriet,"Erivo, like the real-life Tubman, is a tiny woman, barely 5 feet tall, but the forcefulness of her voice and her presence brings ""Harriet"" to vivid life."
Harriet,"It feels like a movie perhaps a bit more than it should. Still, it's effective and, at times, moving, and it has a major asset in Erivo."
Harriet,"Though Harriet has the ingredients for an impactful cinematic experience--an empowered Black woman protagonist, Black love and Black revolutionaries--the film has too many problems that were never resolved."
Harriet,"The intensity and the lyrical fervor of Kasi Lemmons's direction lend this historical drama, about Harriet Tubman's escape from slavery and her work with the Underground Railroad, the exalted energy of secular scripture."
Harriet,"Lemmons' film isn't more than a star vehicle for Erivo. Which isn't a failure, but it flies far beneath the heights of what could have been."
Harriet,"Cynthia Erivo plays ""Minty"" with conviction."
Harriet,Portraying Tubman above all else as a vessel for a higher power ironically only makes her appear less tangible.
Harriet,A vaster and in many ways wilder film than it will get credit for.
Harriet,It's a disappointing and formulaic portrait. Erivo - and Harriet Tubman - deserve a better vehicle.
Harriet,"An impassioned, edifying portrait of a remarkable life, and a fitting showcase for the considerable talents of its star, Tony-winning British actress Cynthia Erivo."
Harriet,What better entry point for learning about one of America's real-life superheroes than this bravura performance from Erivo?
Harriet,"A disappointingly standard biopic, one whose technical flaws and paint-by-numbers clichés threaten to overshadow its subject's compelling story."
Harriet,"History, heroism and leadership are the stuff of Kasi Lemmons' rousing and heartfelt film about the life and times of Harriet Tubman, the Spartacus of the American south."
Harriet,Lemmons' straightforward narrative style foregrounds its purpose - to translate Tubman's heroism into cinematic terms - and the emotional coda pulls it off.
Harriet,"""Harriet"" is nothing if not a dutiful and eye-opening salute. But it still leaves you feeling that the great movie about Harriet Tubman has yet to be made."
Harriet,"If the movie doesn't escape the hagiographic trap of the reverent biopic, it nonetheless will move audiences with a taste for large-canvas inspirational drama."
Chocolat,"The moral argument may be pat and predictable, but the movie disarms you with its charm and its solid craftsmanship...However familiar, the taste is still sweet, the texture light as a souffle, the sentiments pleasantly high caloric."
Chocolat,Chocolat is like being force-fed chocolate for two hours.
Chocolat,Fabulous French fairy tale and romance for teens and up.
Chocolat,"Ultimately, especially coming from director Lasse Hallstrom, such a slight flick doubles as a fat disappointment."
Chocolat,"If you can't be bothered running a nice warm bath, see this instead."
Chocolat,
Chocolat,
Chocolat,
Chocolat,A sinfully scrumptious bonbon.
Chocolat,"Watching Chocolat is like binging on a bottomless box of truffles: Tastes good and sweet at first, but after a while, you start feeling a little green."
Chocolat,"One of those whimsical concoctions that tries too hard, and goes too long, for its own good."
Chocolat,"Chocolat, like Hallstrom's adaptation of The Cider House Rules, succeeds primarily through its casting."
Chocolat,An appealing comic fable aimed at those with a bittersweet tooth.
Chocolat,"A lovely film, encouraging to those who need encouragement and confirming to those who know and live by the liberating truth it espouses."
Chocolat,"It wants desperately to seem like a hand-made delight, but you can tell that it comes from a factory."
Chocolat,A sweet little movie.
Chocolat,Suffers from disparate elements.
Chocolat,"Hallstrom, who gets more sticky-sweet with each new release, needs to learn that too much candy can lead to a tummy ache."
Chocolat,"It's all a bit prefab, but the idea of equating the forces of chocolate and sensual indulgence with the forces of goodness is pretty surefire."
Chocolat,"The movie is charming and whimsical, and Binoche reigns as a serene and wise goddess."
Chocolat,Hardly the stuff of holiday magic.
Chocolat,"If this movie were part of an assortment in a chocolate box, I wouldn't spit it into my napkin. But I wouldn't reach for it a second time, either."
Chocolat,Beautiful to look at and easy to digest.
Chocolat,"It's tantalizing, delectable and randy, a movie of melting eroticism and toothsome humor."
Chocolat,"It wants to be as tasty as a homemade batch of fudge, but it plays more like a Hershey bar off the conveyor belt."
Chocolat,A reasonably uplifting Christmas cookie.
Chocolat,"It's not exactly cutting-edge filmmaking, but rather the soothing cinematic equivalent of a warm cup of decadently rich cocoa."
Chocolat,It somehow manages to let you down and leave you feeling pampered at the same time.
Chocolat,"A work of artistry and craftsmanship at the highest level, sophisticated in its conception and execution, yet possessed of wide appeal."
Chocolat,So assured in its manipulative prowess that only afterward do you realize how fully you've been worked over.
Chocolat,A dream suitable for sharing or clutching greedily to one's bosom -- like a chocolate box.
Chocolat,It's so easy to be mesmerized by Chocolat's brilliant indulgences that one abandons reason altogether.
Chocolat,"Airy, pseudo-folkloric gibberish at best, Chocolat affects shrill agnosticism in the service of a disingenuous pro-tolerance rallying cry."
Chocolat,A charming confection of a comic fable graced by an abundance of delectable performances.
Chocolat,"A richly textured comic fable that blends Old World wisdom with a winking, timely commentary on the assumed moral superiority of the political right."
Chocolat,Labors so desperately to offer a feel-good experience that it ends up being tedious instead.
Chocolat,"It's as agreeably sweet as advertised, with a particularly yummy performance by Juliette Binoche."
A Good Person,"A Good Person mostly works, thanks to the strength of its performers and its compassionate spirit."
A Good Person,"The pleasure lies in watching Pugh and Freeman face up and finally come around to one another. It’s not straightforward, a dance of advance and retreat with both revealing their strengths and weaknesses, but it’s always worth watching."
A Good Person,"Pugh gives a mesmerising performance and Freeman, for once cast in a very substantial role, is better than he’s been in several years."
A Good Person,There are times when casting really does matter and A Good Person is an excellent example.
A Good Person,"The tone is jarring throughout, mostly preachy and po-faced, and built upon several awkwardly overperformed scenes (Lots of “ ‘F*** you!’ ‘No, f*** you!’ ”) that mostly feel like offcuts from an Edward Albee tribute play."
A Good Person,"Having redeemed the rather silly Don’t Worry Darling through sheer charisma, Florence Pugh is once again called upon to bring her magic to otherwise indifferent material."
A Good Person,A bad movie about unreal people.
A Good Person,The reason it doesn't become a rambling mess is because Morgan Freeman and Florence Pugh are so damn good.
A Good Person,"It's got its moments, but a very frustrating film overall."
A Good Person,Pugh has a way of reminding you why a close-up is the single best gift the moving pictures have given us... You don’t blame Braff for wanting to craft a movie around her. But you can blame him for the movie itself that surrounds that performance.
A Good Person,"The intimate story is darkly funny and rich, anchored by Pugh’s unsparing and deeply satisfying performance. Out of darkness, Braff finds hope and the potential for connection among unlikely (yet deeply likable) characters."
A Good Person,"... The script gestures vaguely at the wider US opioid crisis but, Lord knows, Braff is no social realist. The stuff of addiction and loss is instead sprinkled with cuteness, then smothered with a custard of speeches about us all being works-in-progress."
A Good Person,"You’re not seeing Pugh and Freeman at full strength. Still, even in this half-hopeless effort, they’re as good as it gets."
A Good Person,Decidedly forgettable
A Good Person,"Writer/director Zach Braff anchors the film with tender-hearted, touching performances by Morgan Freeman and Florence Pugh."
A Good Person,"A Good Person adds schmaltz where it does not belong, and instead of observational distance that could further humanize the events Allison and the others are confronting, Braff forces ghastly treacle down the viewer’s throat."
A Good Person,[Zach Braff] achieves something accomplished by no other filmmaker to date: he extracts a bad performance from Florence Pugh.
A Good Person,"A Good Person does occasionally spill over into the realm of the mawkish... But on the whole, it's rooted in truths, it tells a human story and its heart is in the right place. It's a good movie."
A Good Person,"It’s a haunting slice of real life that will make you think, feel and maybe even want to reach out to your loved ones. As the film vividly shows, they can be gone in a flash."
A Good Person,“A Good Person” highlights the director’s inability to deal with heavier material. He punctuates this film’s depressing subject matter with hit-or-miss moments of humor and comedy.
A Good Person,"There are enough moments of grace and threads that defy the obvious cliche to keep you interested, even if you’re not wholly buying or invested in every character."
A Good Person,A Good Person is not perfect...But the feeling the movie offers is realistic and sometimes shattering.
A Good Person,"Pugh is watchable doing just about anything, including sweating through her shirts as Allison tries to kick her addiction."
A Good Person,Much of the film reads as a crassly manufactured setup for the arc of redemption and healing that follows.
A Good Person,"The drama is a cluster of scenes with bad dialogue and platitudes instead of actual pathos. The comedy comes in when it’s uncalled for, breaking whatever genuine emotion the actors worked hard to craft."
A Good Person,"It’s a tough indie drama, but A Good Person doesn’t wallow in its own tragedy. It beautifully expresses the flaws in human nature and the tangled mess that results from life and death."
A Good Person,Pugh delivers a superb starring performance that serves to accentuate her growing artistic stature and co-star Morgan Freeman turns in his best work in years after appearing in far too many sub-par vehicles.
A Good Person,"A work of art such as “A Good Person” cannot be the product of some casual connection. It’s the product of a soul connection, and I hope Braff and Pugh get another chance to work together."
A Good Person,Zach Braff’s latest feature excels at taking the measure of how people cope with personal tragedy and does so in a vital and engaging way that’s far more invigorating than depressing.
A Good Person,"Though Pugh valiantly muscles through the melancholy beats of Braff’s melodrama, there are too many other characters and plot threads to allow her to do much besides heave the story forward."
A Good Person,"The relentless pummel of pathos wants to break our hearts, making the fatal presumption that we were in love from the start, too."
A Good Person,"It is as if Pugh is having to push her way through narrative waters that threaten to wash away her performance. No matter how she continues to rise to the challenge, the film’s cascading of contrivances drown her out."
A Good Person,A Good Person fails in both writing and direction.
A Good Person,"The more that Zach Braff’s script tries to thematically tie its disparate threads together, the more that A Good Person comes to resemble the very same type of neat and tidy self-contained version of reality that it ironically skewers in its prologue."
A Good Person,"In his dual capacity as writer and director, Zach Braff here puts us through an ordeal of excruciating contrived nonsense: a masturbatory Calvary of ersatz empathy and emotional wellness."
The Last Vermeer,It will fascinate art lovers as well as 20th century history buffs.
The Last Vermeer,"Pearce gives one of the best performances of his career, investing Van Meegeren with a quicksilver charm and the kind of confidence that can be acquired only through a lifetime of subterfuge."
The Last Vermeer,"Based on a true story, but they take tremendous liberties there...a film full of grandstanding moments that are entirely made up, but I enjoyed it as that, rather than it trying to be anything else..."
The Last Vermeer,"By far the most enjoyable aspect of the film is Pearce's overripe performances as van Meegeren, with an assist from Olivia Grant, acidly sensual as the painter's model/mistress."
The Last Vermeer,An entertaining if uneven mixture of post-World War II fact and fiction.
The Last Vermeer,"It's an inherently fascinating and wild true story, [but] I just thought this was occasionally dull."
The Last Vermeer,"It's an interesting subject for a movie, [but] I'm not sure it quite comes to life."
The Last Vermeer,"[There] is a compelling framework for this story, but it's done in such strange, large strokes."
The Last Vermeer,"The handsome period thriller would have benefitted from a zippier pace, and Bang is stiff and square. But Pearce's complicated, flamboyant historical figure is total best actor Oscar bait."
The Last Vermeer,"It's a clever gesture, but also points out what's ultimately wrong with director Dan Friedkin's postwar thriller: It knows a lot about art history and presumes we know nothing."
The Last Vermeer,"The film takes some significant, unnecessary, and distracting dramatic license."
The Last Vermeer,"Sadly, The Last Vermeer doesn't have time to tackle this question with the depth it demands."
The Last Vermeer,The film moves from detective story to courtroom drama with nicely sketched character studies as a bonus...
The Last Vermeer,"Pearce is captivating as van Meegeren, with his permanently surprised eyebrows that resemble Dalí's mustache and his freewheeling life that included a fair amount of sex and drugs."
The Last Vermeer,[R]est soundly knowing that The Last Vermeer is a pale impersonation of a movie.
The Last Vermeer,"""Vermeer"" chews on some decent food for thought: most notably the idea of moral ambiguity and the compromises one sometimes makes in wartime to survive."
The Last Vermeer,Dreadfully milquetoast
The Last Vermeer,"All the lavish sets and gorgeous costumes in the world - and they are here - can't quite cover over the cracks in Friedkin's canvas, constructed by three writers from a non-fiction book."
The Last Vermeer,"This once notorious, now nearly forgotten story easily captures and holds our interest, and Friedkin's smooth and unostentatious direction never gets in the way of the material."
The Last Vermeer,An uneven but enjoyable historical drama with a standout turn from Guy Pearce.
Cut Throat City,Musician-turned-filmmaker RZA and screenwriter Paul Cuschieri team up for a blistering takedown on post-Katrina FEMA relief work in New Orleans.
Cut Throat City,This has a rich sense of place and an incredible cast of supporting actors.
Cut Throat City,"I do think that Shameik Moore does a lot to ground the emotions of this film... It's fun moment-to-moment and it has a strong sense of character, but the overall piece is a little bit messy."
Cut Throat City,"""Cut Throat City"" is a more thoughtful and personal film, concerned with how systemic racism - and zoning ordinances - can kill more people than a gun."
Cut Throat City,"A film in nonstop conversation with movie history, American history, and itself."
Cut Throat City,"RZA tells this story (from a screenplay by Paul Cuschieri) with deliberation and imaginative daring. With ""Cut Throat City,"" his third feature, he comes into his own as a director."
Cut Throat City,"An entertaining, if familiar ride."
Cut Throat City,"""Cut Throat City"" ends on a note that's too clever by half, but that doesn't undercut all the vibrant, rough-edged, impressive storytelling that led to that moment."
Cut Throat City,"RZA's trenchant take on the synergistic interaction of poverty and greed gradually loses focus as it devolves into a familiar account of warring gangsters, corrupt politicians and a city struggling for redemption."
Cut Throat City,"Cut Throat City is still an ambitious and volatile film, an atmospheric survey of the thankless world of the rich and the damned."
Cut Throat City,"The film is a muddled social-protest thriller that tries to bridge the corrupt machinations upstairs with the desperation of the streets, and can't find a way to connect them convincingly."
Cut Throat City,"There is a shorter version of Cut Throat City - one that better blends conspiracy and violence - that would elevate RZA's film. In the end, the film, like the bank robbers it follows, leaves just a little too much money on the table."
Jules,"Director Marc Turtletaub, who has a long track as a producer and finds himself within the age range of his actors, treats this theme with the correct finesse. [Full review in Spanish]"
Jules,What sounds like the same old story is actually one of the year’s most pleasant surprises.
Jules,Jules is a slight film but an enjoyable one. I’ve come to value any film that offers actors I like something offbeat to add to their resumé.
Jules,"“Jules” utilizes the alien encounter not to explore the possibilities of extraterrestrial life but to paint a portrait of life on Earth. It’s a simple tale, simply told, but with a lot of heart and humanity at the center of it all."
Jules,"A compassionate character study that accomplishes what few current films do: a sweet, simple sense of wonder."
Jules,"While watching this film, I heard someone say “What the [F-bomb]?” three times."
Jules,"This is a low-key charmer, a kind of “E.T” for AARP, with a gentleness to the story that is very endearing."
Jules,"Ostensibly, this is a film about rediscovering one’s humanity by way of otherworldly emotional connection, but the relationship between the central trio and Jules himself never feels particularly resonant."
Jules,It often feels as though Turtletaub would rather you be curled up in your seat with a mug of cocoa than on the edge of it. But the sweetness isn’t entirely unwelcome — not every alien movie can be “Alien.”
Jules,"The cast is a delight, especially Kingsley, whose befuddled glances make your heart swell to the bursting point once you start to realize this is but a sci-fi-laced parable on the alienation that so many mature adults experience in today’s society."
Jules,"It's less a sci-fi parable... than a fairy tale reminding us that the tribulations of getting old are more natural than sad, and best done in the company of loved ones."
Jules,"A movie that’s often too content with its own weirdness to work on any other grounds. ""Jules” isn’t funny enough or heartbreaking enough or anything enough to meaningfully expand on its basic idea."
Jules,"We spend most of our time with Kingsley, who makes the audience care about Milton without pandering through emotional shortcuts."
Jules,"Featuring sterling performances from an uncharacteristically underplaying Ben Kingsley alongside Harriet Sansom Harris and Jane Curtin, Jules emerges as a low-key delight."
Jules,"Simply put, there isn’t enough going on in “Jules.” It’s a sweet but sodden trifle that’s overly pleased with itself..."
The Song of Names,"A payoff is coming - you know it from the film's opening credits, or its poster - but it takes so long to reveal itself that when it does, it can't help but feel anticlimactic."
The Song of Names,"Far from heightening the sense of mystery, the flashback construction renders the present-day dramatically inert, giving fine actors little to do save deliver exposition."
The Song of Names,"There's a mystery at the heart of ""The Song of Names,"" but it isn't much of a mystery, and once it's solved, the movie loses what little interest it has."
The Song of Names,Is a mediocre film worth seeing for a single magnificent sequence that only works properly in context? Here's the test case.
The Song of Names,"Literate, sober, soulful."
The Song of Names,The movie never quite justifies the contrivance of its puzzle-box construction. Parlaying this material into an arty whodunit cheapens the real history invoked.
The Song of Names,"[The Song of Names] remains among the better serious, adult-oriented films of this holiday season."
The Song of Names,"Mainly, this movie chatters when it should sing."
The Song of Names,"The kind of mediocre Holocaust drama that used to be taken more seriously in the 1990s, partly thanks to the Weinstein brothers and Miramax."
The Song of Names,"It's a fine kind of film. It feels like a classic, Oscar-baity film of yesteryear."
The Song of Names,"In the end, the film is unable to bridge the gap between the emotions it elicits and the messages it imparts."
The Song of Names,"It's lucky Shore's original compositions here and the cuts from the classical repertoire, some performed with impressive skill by child actor Luke Doyle himself, are strong enough to give heft to an otherwise earnest, credulity-straining melodrama."
The Song of Names,"A fatally old-fashioned and lugubrious historical drama, muting the emotional payoff it labors so hard to deliver."
All My Life,"Somehow All My Life seems oddly lacking in stakes, which is so weird considering the story (the main symptoms of onscreen Chau's deadly but photogenic disease seem to be a little tiredness and sweatiness)."
All My Life,"Director Marc Meyers and screenwriter Todd Rosenberg manipulate us without restraint, but Rothe and Shum are so endearing and their characters so pleasant that you don't mind it too much."
All My Life,Sloppy sentimentality.
All My Life,"Rothe and Shum Jr. have such nice, authentic chemistry that they should put it to good use again. Perhaps there's a jaunty rom-com out there with their names on it."
All My Life,This three-hankie weepie holds a surprising amount of heart and hope to accompany all the cathartic crying.
All My Life,This will be a film with all the philosophical substance of an inspirational Facebook chain post.
All My Life,"""All My Life"" is nothing if not pleasant and amiable as it makes its way down the road to heartwarming."
The Assistant,ERROR
2 Hearts,"Skovbye and Mitchell are the biggest standouts, striving to bring believability and genuine emotion to the proceedings, but it's hard to resuscitate a project this far gone."
2 Hearts,"This is the sort of film for which the term ""tearjerker"" was invented, but this one jerks them so violently you may need medical attention afterwards."
2 Hearts,It's a softheaded piece of morbid romantic treacle - two parallel cloying love stories for the price of one.
2 Hearts,"Frankly, 2 Hearts is the drama this year deserves. One that starts with promise before descending into madness."
2 Hearts,It's wholesome but starchy fare: a story of sacrifice and good fortune that feels less like a movie than a marketing vehicle for the power of divine providence.
The Banshees of Inisherin,Martin McDonagh expertly threads humour and pathos like a master weaver who knows exactly when to change colours.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The Banshees of Inisherin is not just a beautifully written screenplay. This deeply affecting, warmly humorous, beautifully acted and handsomely photographed (by Ben Davis) film is a major work and top of my list for the best film of 2022."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"As a comedy duo, Farrell and Gleeson are money in the bank, just as they were in McDonagh’s first feature In Bruges. As a pairing of actor and filmmaker, Farrell and McDonagh are no less in sync."
The Banshees of Inisherin,Evocative cinematography and a gorgeous score make this a spellbinding men-gone-wrong fable.
The Banshees of Inisherin,The film toggles masterfully between comedy and tragedy; realism and fable. It manages to be both of the moment and completely timeless.
The Banshees of Inisherin,I'd almost call this a horror film.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"It's a gut punch of a comic-drama that keeps finding new ways to land hard-hitting body blows, and it's easily one of the year's very best films."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Condon and Keoghan give “Banshees” extra personality and verve, while Farrell and Gleeson are the two halves of its beating heart."
The Banshees of Inisherin,McDonagh is a master world builder. Whether you want to live in those worlds for two hours of your only life is purely a matter of individual taste.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"McDonagh, Farrell, and Gleeson deliver something special, The Banshees of Inisherin unquestionably one of the year’s best films."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Gleeson and Farrell revive their mesmerizing interplay, surrounded by breathtaking Irish scenery and a brilliant ensemble cast."
The Banshees of Inisherin,Banshees’ dramatic resonance is a result of how deftly McDonagh delivers his characters’ virtues and vices. What’s hilarious and tragic is that both are so modest compared to the amount of anguish they cause.
The Banshees of Inisherin,I think what's quite clever about the structure of the film is that McDonagh flips your allegiances [in a way that's very finely balanced.
The Banshees of Inisherin,Colin Farrell is a revelation in this. I think it's probably his best performance ever.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The word ""tragicomic"" was coined for performances, and movies, like these."
The Banshees of Inisherin,“Banshees” is like a short story trying to be a novel. The extra pages get filled with the postcard views.
The Banshees of Inisherin,Farrell and Gleeson are the perfect pair to give these characters the balance of humor and heartbreak.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Certainly one of Farrell’s finest performances and like the film itself, his loneliness sticks in your craw like an oft-recited Irish limerick."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"It’s visually stunning and consistently witty while being unafraid to ask serious questions about life as it is, and should be, lived. It is proper art."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Writer-director Martin McDonagh’s soulful masterpiece offers a a windswept elegy on a camaraderie that has reached its inexplicable expiration, as well as melancholic rumination on mortality."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The result is McDonagh’s most fully realized work since his breakthrough play, “The Beauty Queen of Leenane,” a generation ago."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Ultimately this is a movie about the two men, and there’s just not much there — not enough to justify a feature film."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"A hauntingly sad, compellingly strange film about friendship and toxic masculinity."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"McDonagh’s tale is both a tiny story of two men, and a larger allegory of what happens when a small disagreement spins out of control."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"It's visually stunning, well written and the acting is top-notch. But without context, the plot falls flat, leaving behind an unsettling and bizarre film."
The Banshees of Inisherin,Marvelous performances from Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"While we’ve been taking Gleeson’s off-kilter charisma for granted since 1998’s The General, the performance that leaves scars is Farrell’s. It’s tough to think of a portrayal that finds so many emotional shades and levels of depth in incomprehension."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Friend against friend, brother against brother, love lost and grudges cracking the fabric of society; it’s all contained in this little fable."
The Banshees of Inisherin,Gleeson and Farrell make the film a delight.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Swings between the hilarious, the horrifying and the heartbreaking in magnificent fashion."
The Banshees of Inisherin,I consider Banshees nothing short of a marvel.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The Banshees of Inisherin’s greatest gift to its audience is its refusal to turn its eccentric, intimate story into an allegory for anything other than what it is: the sad tale of an abruptly interrupted friendship in a beautiful, isolated place."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Wounded but funny, quiet but resonant and resistant to anything like a Hollywood formula, The Banshees of Inisherin is a strangely profound little comedy. It’s one of the few true originals among movies this year."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The Banshees of Inisherin, the last in a trilogy of plays by McDonagh set in the islands, is a work of great purity, beautifully made."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Gleason and Farrell, re-teamed with “In Bruges” writer/director McDonogh, give performances of deep complexity and authenticity. We can see them each, in his own way, struggling with thoughts and emotions they find difficult to explain."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Given its small scale and lyrical dialogue, the movie may bring to mind McDonagh’s early work as a playwright. It’s a triumph of the same kind of harsh minimalism that fueled his shows."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"McDonagh’s latest is heart-wrenching in its simplicity, dark-humoured and unadorned in its sentiments. It’s a film equal to In Bruges -- perhaps even more effective in the way its relative restraint presents brutality as humdrum as a trip to the pub."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The film can be viciously funny, but that can also feel beside the point. Which is? Well... Male ego is in the mix, of course."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"One measure of the movie’s skill, and its generosity, is that it embraces the wisdom of both its protagonists."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Inisherin may not be a real place, but its eccentric characters, rugged vistas and vivid local legends make it an attractive tourist destination all the same."
The Banshees of Inisherin,There’s power in the message conveyed by writer/director Martin McDonagh’s screenplay; it’s less a drama and more a rumination about the failings of humanity.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The Banshees of Inisherin is a rich, soulful journey, full of agony, dry Irish wit and big, haunting questions. If it’s answers you’re looking for, however, you’re not going to find them on Inisherin."
The Banshees of Inisherin,A movie that approaches big themes with deceptive simplicity. A work of absurdist genius.
The Banshees of Inisherin,A profoundly riveting and moving portrait of the consequences of not valuing niceness.
The Banshees of Inisherin,What animates “The Banshees of Inisherin” and saves it from stiffness is the clout of the performances.
The Banshees of Inisherin,A stone cold classic.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Ignited by career-best performances from Colin Farrell and Bredan Gleason, this new classic from son of Ireland Martin McDonagh brims over with dark comic magic and jolts of bloody scary hell. Fasten your seatbelts for one of the best movies of the year."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The Banshees of Inisherin is a fucked-up kind of fun that'll leave you chuckling, heartsick, and a wee bit anxious. Don't miss it."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"With its mix of murder-ballad melancholy and bawdy, picaresque slapstick comedy, The Banshees of Inisherin is a contradictory sort of crowd-pleaser."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Whatever you choose to call it, the film is often very funny."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Farrell and Gleeson, reuniting from “In Bruges,” know each other’s rhythms by now and concatenate beautifully..."
The Banshees of Inisherin,Martin McDonagh lyrically whips every incident in the film into a mordantly funny dark fable about men’s innate inability to work together for the betterment of society at large.
The Banshees of Inisherin,Banshees inverts cliché as much as it embraces it.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Give Martin McDonagh a topic like friendship to tackle, and he’s bound to warp it into something so subversive, so twisted, so extreme … that you’ll laugh your ass off for two full hours."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"At its best, The Banshees of Inisherin whispers and laments and amuses the way McDonagh's best stage writing does. And it offers the invaluable opportunity to see Farrell in his hangdog element"
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Beyond all the quips and souring banter, there’s no shortage of the stuff in a break-up story that leaves a haunting impression."
The Banshees of Inisherin,Very good show all around.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Another great feel-bad treat from Martin McDonagh, featuring one of Colin Farrell’s best performances yet as a guy trying (and failing) to deal with the fallout of a falling out."
The Banshees of Inisherin,A simple and diabolical tale of a friendship’s end shot through with bristling humor and sudden moments of startling violence.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Unpredictably counter-intuitive performances from a cast headed by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, plus McDonagh’s deliciously rhythmic comic dialogue, should give viewers a very good time – but may send them out shivering."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"If you’re usually immune to McDonagh’s blarney you’re unlikely to be any more bewitched by his Banshees, but with Gleeson and Farrell on fine form, it’s pleasant enough company for a couple of hours the next time your drinking pals snub you."
The Banshees of Inisherin,A testament to McDonagh's gift for dialogue and the infinitely watchable chemistry between Farrell and Gleeson...
The Banshees of Inisherin,"The writer-director’s superbly acted fourth feature is his most Irish work for the screen to date, and also one of his best."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Farrell and Gleeson’s lovely, perfectly mismatched performances... both betray their own manner of gaping, aching vulnerability."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Its constant undercurrent of humor affords the story’s most pressing questions an appropriately ridiculous context, one that speaks to the absurdities of all existence."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"McDonagh uses comedy like a claw hammer, smashing open tricky subjects to expose the goo inside."
The Banshees of Inisherin,As a study of male loneliness and swallowed anger it is weirdly compelling and often very funny.
The Banshees of Inisherin,Farrell brings extra layers of depth and mournfulness to the classic McDonagh pattern.
The Banshees of Inisherin,"It’s his quietest movie and, in many ways, his most touching, which is not to say that it won’t make you squirm in your seat as you wonder if it’s OK to laugh at what he’s throwing at you."
The Banshees of Inisherin,"Invoking the spirit of John Hinde postcards ... McDonagh confirms that, for those not temperamentally opposed to the entire shtick, there is much life yet in his embrace of durable narrative traditions"
The Quiet Girl,"... A quiet film. A whisper of a film, really. And its unassuming nature makes it all the more effective."
The Quiet Girl,"The Quiet Girl unfurls gently... it seems so simple but leads only to possibilities, and one word – said twice – that will be engraved upon your heart."
The Quiet Girl,"In a world of noise — and noisy, jumbled films — this story of found family speaks loudest when saying nothing."
The Quiet Girl,"The story is simple; it’s the connection between an invisible girl and a woman who finally sees her that forms the backbone of this lovely, handmade film."
The Quiet Girl,As beautiful as it is devastating.
The Quiet Girl,"Through heart-wrenching, nuanced and arresting performances by Clinch, Crowley and Bennett, The Quiet Girl technically lives up to its name, but speaks volumes about the transformative power of what it means to be loved."
The Quiet Girl,"A genuine work of art by a genuinely empathetic artist, and one of the single most moving, heartfelt, and heartbreaking movies from any country in the last decade. That only sounds like hyperbole until you see it."
The Quiet Girl,"The kind of quiet film that could easily get lost in a noisy season; lean in anyway, and listen."
The Quiet Girl,"Finely framed by the cinematographer Kate McCullough, “The Quiet Girl” is an idyll, yet its placid surface is puckered by anxiety."
The Quiet Girl,Movies don’t come much more exquisitely heartbreaking than this.
The Quiet Girl,"A stirring testament to what’s possible on a modest scale with a few well-chosen words. Set in 1981 rural Ireland, The Quiet Girl comes from Claire Keegan’s short story “Foster,” and it preserves much of the rhythm and concision of a good short story."
The Quiet Girl,The film works by stealth.
The Quiet Girl,I don’t think I’ve ever seen a film that conveyed with such vividness and precision the helplessness of childhood.
The Quiet Girl,"Without voiceover narration tying everything together, some scenes feel out of place, random, or offer little beyond aesthetics."
The Quiet Girl,The Quiet Girl earns its most emotionally powerful scenes because of the way that it so gracefully convinces us that it wasn’t even building toward them in the first place.
The Quiet Girl,"Made with sensitivity and care by first-time writer-director Colm Bairead, combines serene editing, quiet reserves of strength, and subdued performances that allow you to think and feel instead of just watch."
The Quiet Girl,"I liked it, but it's too quiet... The film suffers from being a little careful not to touch all the sentimental buttons."
The Quiet Girl,"Extremely lovely, gentle, and rewards your patience."
The Quiet Girl,"Everything in this heartfelt tale is made with the deepest sincerity, and gently packed with soulful portrayals and lovely imagery."
The Quiet Girl,"The director and his young star may work in hushed tones, but their talents sing out loudly."
The Quiet Girl,"Marks the first narrative feature from director Colm Bairéad, who concentrates for long stretches on visual effects with light that soon start to feel repetitive and pictorial rather than illuminating of character or story."
The Quiet Girl,There may not be a movie more expressive of the season’s benevolent ethos than this hushed work about kith and kindness.
The Quiet Girl,Few films explore both the shelter and the solitude of silence with the eloquence of Colm Bairéad’s gently captivating Irish-language drama The Quiet Girl.
The Quiet Girl,"Everything about The Quiet Girl lives up to Cait’s sobriquet, an elegantly balanced drama that weaponises the power of what’s not said."
The Quiet Girl,"The Quiet Girl is a small gem of a film. The acting is excellent and the simple but affecting story, with its setting of a lush green and surprisingly sunny Ireland, packs an emotional wallop."
The Quiet Girl,This delicate heartbreaker of a film is wrapped around a deceptively simple premise.
The Quiet Girl,"... The film’s writer-director, Colm Bairéad, shows how a well-judged movie can come near to corniness but still be deeply poignant."
The Quiet Girl,"The director Colm Bairéad’s remarkable debut is invested with meaning, lyricism and life. The images sing but they also breathe."
The Quiet Girl,One of the most exquisitely realised films of the year.
The Quiet Girl,"A coming-of-age tale with an unerring eye for detail, this seemingly familiar drama set in rural Ireland in 1981 is also quietly subversive."
The Quiet Girl,There is a pervasive sense of unspoken menace lurking just outside the frame (or somewhere in the near past or future). But it is also a celebration of uncomplicated human kindness.
The Quiet Girl,"A peaceful poem of grief, sadness and learning to find your voice, told with empathy and care by first-time feature filmmaker Colm Bairéad."
The Quiet Girl,It is a jewel.
The Quiet Girl,"Bairéad’s script, based on a short story by Claire Keegan, remains resolutely focused on the smaller end of the scale, the intimate, ordinary sorrows of loneliness and loss and coming of age."
The Quiet Girl,"An unexpectedly beautiful assembly of narrative, image and sound which takes its cue from the title to build quietly to an emotional catharsis."
The Quiet Girl,"There's a heartfelt simplicity to the film's story, a rumination on grief's longevity and pain through the eyes of a child."
The Personal History of Dav…,"[A] mad, loving, and brilliantly cinematic extrapolation of the novel..."
The Personal History of Dav…,"It is Dev Patel who carries this ensemble with great flair, looking every inch the boy who has fallen upon hard times and longs to be recognised as the gentleman he is."
The Personal History of Dav…,An exuberantly optimistic film celebrating the life force of art and eccentricity. Who couldn't use a little of that right now.
The Personal History of Dav…,"The new film adaptation, co-written by Iannucci and Simon Blackwell, takes that human energy as its lifting-off point, and is simply too faithful, rich, and bright to be dimmed by the circumstances of its release."
The Personal History of Dav…,"As for Patel, he makes a wonderful Copperfield -- sturdy, kind, charismatic, and filled with a childlike curiosity and wonder even into adulthood (and, of course, great hair)."
The Personal History of Dav…,[Iannucci] is clearly at home with sprawling casts of characters and comfortable allowing them to chew the scenery when the mood comes over them.
The Personal History of Dav…,"To Dickens purists this contemporary view ofDavid Copperfieldmay be a bit too radical, but I was certainly entertained. It suffers only in comparison to a beloved movie that swept me off my feet when I was an adolescent"
The Personal History of Dav…,A sincere affection for and understanding of the source material shines through in its wit and good nature.
The Personal History of Dav…,...filled with clever if obvious commentary on institutionalized class snobbery.
The Personal History of Dav…,"...the actual musicality of Iannucci's staging for the camera... dialogue, blocking, sound, the handheld camera. It's brisk, and the best scenes feel like you could set a metronome to them."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Crafting a don't-miss movie out of Charles Dickens' 1850 doorstop of a novel, Amando Inannicci and a sublime cast, led by a never-better Dev Patel, add a blast of mad, modern irreverence that is totally irresistible."
The Personal History of Dav…,"I wanted to embrace this one for its bright spirit... Truth be told, though, the film, which Mr. Iannucci directed from a screenplay he wrote with Simon Blackwell, is blissed out on its own cleverness and ultimately exhausting."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Nimble, appealing and attuned to the nuances of Dickens' spirit, Patel is a good Copperfield for today, a bright young man who's able to overcome adversity and go far."
The Personal History of Dav…,"So how would Dickens greet the latest film? He would, I reckon, be roused by its momentum and proud of its unblushing theatricality."
The Personal History of Dav…,A boisterous hymn to the creative impulse and a celebration of memory and imagination.
The Personal History of Dav…,"The Personal History of David Copperfield can be deliciously, viciously devious in its pursuit of laughter."
The Personal History of Dav…,"As jubilant and shrewdly observed, as touching, as romantic, as exciting, as the novel itself."
The Personal History of Dav…,Every cast member is hilarious. Dickens will be LOL'ing in his grave.
The Personal History of Dav…,"As he relates his story, is David remembering correctly? Is he a reliable narrator? Who knows? But he's definitely a fleet, funny and warmhearted one."
The Personal History of Dav…,"A souped-up, trimmed-down adaptation so fleet and entertaining that its cleverness doesn't immediately register."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Iannucci is a master at locating absurdity everywhere he looks, and he recognizes that few things are more absurd than ingrained prejudice and received wisdom."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Dev Patel is glorious in the title role, skillfully weaving between pathos and slapstick, often mere moments apart, anchoring the film with an exuberant affability."
The Personal History of Dav…,"[I]t's wholly enjoyable on a scene-by-scene and character-by-character basis. But the high spirits of this handsome, well-played production fight against low-angle glimpses of grinding poverty and penury until the entire affair has to be called a draw."
The Personal History of Dav…,"If ever a match were made in cine-literary heaven it would be Charles Dickens and Armando Iannucci, each a master of probing social criticism, slashing wit and floridly besotted love of language."
The Personal History of Dav…,The humor in The Personal History of David Copperfield sometimes comparatively tends toward the fuzzy and overly gentle. But it's hard to begrudge it that when it's also capable of bright bursts of delight.
The Personal History of Dav…,"""Copperfield"" may not be Iannucci's most personal work, his engaging, inventive and visually colorful, multicultural embrace of Dickens' old-school English world is appealing, especially if you're not wedded to every word and twist of the original text."
The Personal History of Dav…,"They've taken Dickens' epic and pared it down to the essentials, and the laughs. The result is quite airy, yet also a soulful tale about writing, and owning, your own story."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Despite some longueurs around the two-thirds point, as there often is with well-worn episodic adventures, ""The Personal History of David Copperfield"" is a tonic with a genuinely moving coda."
The Personal History of Dav…,"The script extracts the essence of Dickens' style from the narrative while editing out the melodrama. If pushed, Iannucci and Blackwell prefer to be cryptic rather than risk any hint of the tendentious. And it's a message well absorbed by the whole cast."
The Personal History of Dav…,"It has an element of magic...so accessible, and it plays with creativity and the creative process in a way I thought was delightful and so much fun."
The Personal History of Dav…,"A vivacious adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic, this is as wide-eyed and open-hearted as they come."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Visual dash and aplomb abound, and the production design is a dream."
The Personal History of Dav…,"It really is a wonderfully entertaining film, managing to both respect and reinvent the novel from which it takes its lead, creating something new and exciting in the process."
The Personal History of Dav…,"...it's a very funny film, and the casting is brilliant. The inclusivity doesn't feel at all odd or jarring."
The Personal History of Dav…,Iannucci has managed to bring something fresh and new to the original text without having to resort to jarringly obvious anachronistic devices beside the film's inspired diverse casting.
The Personal History of Dav…,"Still, the film ultimately lives or dies on the strength of its central performance. And in Patel's hands it's a thing of beauty. You've got to love him."
The Personal History of Dav…,"No term better sums up the Dickensian aesthetic than ""generosity"" and the busy clatter of cultures yells that word throughout."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Armando Iannucci's adaptation of Charles Dickens's David Copperfield is a romp told at a lick, and while it's fun and likeable with fantastic casting - Hugh Laurie as Mr Dick is especially sublime - it is not particularly immersive or memorable."
The Personal History of Dav…,The film is nothing if not brisk.
The Personal History of Dav…,"If one scene could capture the whole movie, it would be Patel emerging from the Trotwood residence laden with pots and pans, bellowing and clattering to scare a passing donkey. We are all that donkey."
The Personal History of Dav…,"A breezy, brilliant treat. Iannucci may have softened the bite of his comedy but replaces it with something remarkably optimistic and buoyant, telling a story as joyously relevant as it was a century-and-a-half ago."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Needed to be fresh and fun to justify its existence and it is, often thanks to that scorching ensemble cast."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Also, Dickens's female characters are much improved, so all hail this showcase for the talent of Iannucci, a sly reminder that it's possible to be both a national treasure and a thorn in the establishment's side."
The Personal History of Dav…,The script feels like it was tested in a wind tunnel - while the use of farce as the plot's default register makes a virtue of the rush to get through everything that remains.
The Personal History of Dav…,"Everything rattles and zings like a pinball machine, and it's a bracing, entertaining, richly satisfying experience."
The Personal History of Dav…,Director Armando Iannucci uses Simon Blackwell's script to form a storybook life that is as winsome and charming as it is boring and too British.
The Personal History of Dav…,"Iannucci has fun with the classic serial-turned-novel and throws in a bit of defiant color-blind casting for kicks, but it takes some getting used to a gentler, less biting Iannucci."
The Personal History of Dav…,Armando Iannucci's rollicking adaptation announces itself as a radical and progressive reclamation of the heritage 'lit pic' from the off.
The Personal History of Dav…,"The meta-fiction may be overdone, but that and the director's feeling for tone create the expansive atmosphere in which a talented multiracial cast lead by Dev Patel can master everything from pure melodrama to high comedy."
The Personal History of Dav…,"If this represents Iannucci at his softest and most heartfelt, it's far from an embarrassment, and at times, it's a balm."
The Personal History of Dav…,"But while the act of gracefully condensing this big book into a coherent movie is indeed impressive, the truth is that said movie does end up feeling a bit like glorified cliff's notes, albeit ones enlivened by Iannucci's gift for volleying banter."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Iannucci has made his most human film, an attempt to find something helpful, funny and above all positive to help us to navigate the sorry state of Britain of today."
The Personal History of Dav…,"It's not hard to parallel David/Dickens's head-spinningly intricate descriptors with Iannucci's own prodding, poetically vulgar rhetoric."
The Personal History of Dav…,"On brightly lit lawns captured by cockeyed Terry Gilliam-esque camera angles, the film comes to fizzy, jaunty life -- nearly all of Iannucci's aggression has been squeezed into storyboarding."
The Personal History of Dav…,"It's the sort of movie that gives nearly every character a thoughtful closeup before, somewhat fantastically, bringing most of them back together at the end for a tender sendoff."
The Personal History of Dav…,"As much as the movie maintains its upbeat and whimsical tone, it falls short of directing that approach to some constructive end."
The Personal History of Dav…,"What's missing, and what makes this adaptation an enjoyable romp rather than a great film, is Dickens's narrative pull. Iannucci is better at shaping scenes than he is at telling a story, so the film is a bit up and down."
The Personal History of Dav…,"It's a story that remains as witty and resilient as its main character and its charms, like David's, remain impossible to resist."
The Personal History of Dav…,"Like some kind of long-lost Monty Python sketch, Iannucci's revisionist ""David Copperfield"" alternates between intellect and absurdity, blending high- and lowbrow elements."
The Personal History of Dav…,"A fast-moving yarn, sometimes hilarious and always entertaining."
After We Collided,A series of half-digested movie tropes regurgitated by Google Rom-dram.
After We Collided,"American ""Afternators"" will no doubt be similarly pleased with this slightly campier continuation of the series. For everyone else, however, there's not enough innovation to make the second installment a worthwhile jumping-on point."
After We Collided,Too moronic to work as a serious romantic drama and too boring to work as straightforward sleaze.
After We Collided,"""After"" was merely awful. ""After We Collided"" is atrocious."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Words on Bathroom Walls is a moving, well-intentioned film with its heart in the right place that makes a noble effort to tackle a subject that has in the past been so broadly badly handled."
Words on Bathroom Walls,This is a lively and sensitively acted YA drama about a teenager with schizophrenia... but it feels like a semi-copout.
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Together, these two bright stars-to-be carry ""Words on Bathroom Walls"" across the finish line."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"It's funny that a film can be both overly facile and clear-eyed at the same time, but Words on Bathroom Walls is just that."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"I was really impressed by its ability to approach the subject of mental illness in a way that is sensitive, insightful, and thoughtful without ever being mawkish."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Plummer's genuine, heartfelt performance will likely go a long way in humanizing a diagnosis that is often unfairly stigmatized."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"There are pockets of truth, grace and pain in this portrait of troubled adolescence, and its talented young stars know where to find them."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Nick Naveda's adaptation of Watson's book rations out worrisome developments with sensitivity, and the friendly chemistry between Plummer and Russell does the rest of the work."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Written by Nick Naveda and directed by Thor Freudenthal, it takes some big swings at a big subject and almost - not quite - pulls it off."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Meant to dramatize the effects of mental illness, the hero's three imaginary friends come off as caricature."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Eager to split the difference between age-appropriate entertainment and raw honesty, ""Words on Bathroom Walls"" hedges a bit in its final act, delivering the kind of happy ending only seen in movies."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Halfway through I found myself rooting for the film to be the best version of itself, a sign that a film is working even when it's not completely successful."
Words on Bathroom Walls,Freudenthal has a genuine gift for working with children and teens.
Words on Bathroom Walls,"Plummer mines thorny psychological territory with skillful aplomb, showcasing a multifaceted internalized gracefulness that's outstanding."
Words on Bathroom Walls,"When ""Words on Bathroom Walls"" is at its sunniest and most blithe, the moral of the story feels a little more like a punchline than is appropriate."
Words on Bathroom Walls,The film reeks of the extremely idealistic notions of young love that plague many a YA adaptation.

A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"What a difference a day makes, when it's a day as beautiful as this."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"By blending the very serious with the childlike, Heller's film locates real feeling in what could easily have been a run-of-the-mill tearjerker."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,Another tremendous film from one of our era's great young directors.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,A really entertaining and touching film.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Heller evidently excels at these kinds of narratives. Here, she presents an enchanting tale in which a cynic's world is turned upside down when he finds redemption in the most unlikely place."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is, at its core, a film about the hard and constant work of becoming a better person."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"The film feels at once adventurous and classically simple. And of all things, lovely - as disarmingly, implausibly so as Mister Rogers."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"It could easily be twee twaddle, but A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood is a nuanced, formally playful delight, a perfectly pitched and played ode to goodness. All hail Marielle Heller."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"At a time when so many mainstream movies are loud and brash and noisy, this subdued character study is a genuinely pleasurable experience."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"It's hard to tune in to the fervent tone of straight-faced sincerity which permeates every scene... If we ever needed proof that our flaws make us human, it's here. Perfection makes dull company."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood might make a certain demographic in America go nostalgic for its slice of lost childhood, but also manages to reach out to the world at large."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,What could have been a predictable exercise in celebrity worship turns into something more subtle and unexpected in the hands of director Marielle Heller - with some bold visual flourishes that bring Beautiful Day into downright dreamy territory.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"For a film that I occasionally resisted, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood sure made me cry a lot."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"With so much time devoted to Lloyd's world, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood doesn't have room for any sort of standard arc about Fred Rogers..."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,This is a movie that's both entertainment and spiritual toolkit-take from it what you need.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Marielle Heller's movie isn't driving at docudrama authenticity; it's more of a meditation on the meaning of Mr. Rogers, and of the implications-real and imagined-of a world made in his image."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"It's hard not to wish that the story was as consistently good as the man -- and performance -- at its center... The temptation is nevertheless simply to give in to the movie, which is perhaps as it should be."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,Wisely and gently subversive in blurring the barrier between the as-it-ought-to-be world of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and the as-it-is world of adult conflict and complications.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,A kind of gentle and deeply affecting filmmaking that is completely original and reflective of Rogers himself.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"A celebration of Mr. Rogers and the healing capabilities of his words and doctrine, the movie may not be a splashy as many of the year-end multiplex stocking stuffers but the experience it offers tugs effectively at the heart strings."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,Hanks' energy in the role wonderfully gets at what A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood wants to convey.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,The movie enables us to glimpse something great or near-great: Hanks's profoundly instinctive portrait of a preternaturally tolerant and rational man. But this trumped-up story keeps getting in the way.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"""A Beautiful Day"" is a work of intimate and tragic politics, of unsought heroism that's cursed with the very fact of its necessity."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is about the small encounters that lead to human change. Mostly it's about listening and making others feel heard. The acting, blessedly, is life-size."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Even if you think Rogers' psychological model is simplistic, you can't help but climb aboard."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Wouldn't we all like to have a Fred Rogers in our life? This lovely film allows us to indulge in wish-fulfillment, which is something movies do so well. We could use a little more of it these days."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Anyone who watches it will be moved - and is almost guaranteed to be a kinder, happier, more open-hearted person by the end of the film."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Given the nature of the production, sticky sweetness threatens at every turn, along with naked contrivance. Yet the movie bets on goodness, and wins."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"It's a sincere, measured, and clever homage to its subject, a work of storytelling that would have made Mister Rogers proud."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"It's as if Hanks tucks a cozy blanket around the entire film, embodying the beatific warmth and kindness of Rogers so that every time he appears on screen in ""Beautiful Day,"" you feel better and more hopeful."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"If nothing is more difficult in the movies than convincingly portraying authentic goodness, then A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood can be counted near-perfect."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood brings that essential essence of Fred Rogers to life.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"No less than Morgan Neville's lovely documentary ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?,"" ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" feels like a beam of kindness at a moment that profoundly needs it."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"It's not only Mister Rogers's kindness that hovers over ""Beautiful Day,"" but also his creative spirit. Paying tribute to his skills as a composer, performer and puppeteer, the movie affirms his status as a hero of the imagination."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Let's go ahead and call Marielle Heller the most skillful director working in Hollywood at the moment, because I can't think of anyone else who could keep ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" from collapsing into a bath of heartwarming schmoo."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,Marielle Heller takes a script that many filmmakers would turn into cringe-inducing treacle and interrogates the sentimental trappings.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Rather than following a conventional biopic structure, Heller channels and builds her film around the spirit of Rogers, which is embodied in Hanks' gentle, graceful performance."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"In an era that seems fatally mired in fear, anger and mistrust, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" arrives as something more than a movie. It feels like an answered prayer."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Tom Hanks' effortless ability to step into Rogers' shoes - er, comfy pair of sneakers - is the big reason this enchanting film will make even ice-veined cynics develop a sudden case of the sniffles."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"""A Beautiful Day"" is lifted by a fascinating performance at its center, by a charismatic movie star who just happens to also be a great actor."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,The ever-present potential for bathos in a movie about accessing one's own inner child is offset by a dedication to visual whimsy and playfulness that can recall Michel Gondry.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Under Marielle Heller's transfixing direction, that consummate actor Tom Hanks succeeds triumphantly at moving past imitation to find Mister Rogers' nurturing soul. It's a damn-near irresistible movie that speaks from the heart. Let it in."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,It sends you out of the movie feeling as if you've spent time with Fred Rogers and that you have definitely benefited from the contact.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is a mix of genuinely moving moments and slightly winking artifice."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Hanks, especially, keeps the trolley on the rails, and everything Heller is after in this film comes together in a remarkable final shot..."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"One is left wanting to know more about Mr. Rogers, but the film reduces him to little more than a kind of superhero family therapist."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,Tom Hanks steals the show.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,I blubbed quietly throughout the entire movie. Although that could have been the sleep deprivation.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"As with her superb recent adaptation of the literary-forgery memoir Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Heller has a flair for making this kind of material feel nothing like a routine biopic."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Director Marielle Heller sensitively guides the cast through this loving fable. Not all audiences will be thrilled that they're getting a ""life-coach"" movie for the holiday seas, instead of the real skinny about the TV icon's personal life."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,Hanks reigns mild mannered... [and] Heller exceeds even her wondrous work in Can You Ever Forgive Me?
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"But just as Mr. Rogers used his show to talk about big issues with children in a tone that was softer and more halting than you'd expect, so does Heller stick to understatement in a way that threatens to become dull or sappy but never does."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"With clear-eyed rigour, Heller, Hanks and Rhys put aside cheap sentiment and earn this film's authentic heartfelt emotion."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,A film like this can turn into an unbearably soppy four-hankies tale. But it is to Heller's credit that she keeps the sentimentality in check even though I confess to wet eyes in a few places.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,Hanks is a beacon of warmth and humanity from the moment he zips up his trademark red cardigan and addresses the audience.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,[Marielle] Heller once again proves she is an incredible director of actors.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Bring your tissues and your daddy issues, because Mr. Rogers is coming to heal you in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Tom Hanks fits the red sweater like he was born in it, but Marielle Heller's unique take on Fred Rogers' magnetism exceeds impersonation."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"By the end, even the most cynical of viewers may feel like Lloyd, their defenses breached; eyes may roll, but they might well up a little, too."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Hanks is, not surprisingly, excellently cast, but it's Heller's direction and inventive aesthetic instinct - everything is washed out browns, with the exception of a moving blue-lit finale - that sell the work so well."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood sneaks around the barriers we throw up in adulthood, finding the kid inside of us who just wants to know we are loved."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"The story of Vogel and Rogers' connection is conventional, but [Director Marielle] Heller imbues it with delightful creative flourishes that set it apart from how a standard biopic might tackle this particular story."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"It ought to make you roll your eyes - except that Mr. Rogers had a way of disarming doubters who fell into his orbit, and the film does, too."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Neighborhood is full of looking, listening, understanding - fitting for a film about a man who was incredibly charismatic, slow of gesture and speech in ways that encouraged everyone around him to perform his kindness back at him."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Hanks, comfortable in his twinkly-eyed wheelhouse, is properly supportive -- it's a supporting role -- while Rhys becomes the movie's little boy, diving into his own daddy issues, hopefully resolving them in time to write the big heroic cover story."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"While Hanks avoids attempting to awkwardly replicate Rogers' voice - although he does nail his cadence - he focuses on exuding the same bewitching, patient curiosity that Rogers had in the people he met."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Nearly impossible not to L-I-K-E it, exactly as it is."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,It's the rare biopic that doesn't wander into predictability.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,Hanks feels so right in the role from the beginning.
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"This sweet, unassuming movie has deeper sensibilities lurking beneath its surface, just like Rogers himself."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Even in territories where audiences are unfamiliar with Fred Rogers' hokey appeal, the film's humour, its amiable charm offensive and its gentle weirdness should disarm all but the most cynical."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Heller brings her usual wit and playfulness to proceedings, side-stepping mawkish sentimentality in favour of matter-of-fact pragmatism."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"Marielle Heller's film itself, however, is a rather more modest achievement, sympathetic and yet entirely predictable in its dramatic trajectory of making a believer of an angry, cynical journalist."
A Beautiful Day in the Neig…,"""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is a lovely, soft-hearted fable that works on you in an enchanting way."
The Last Full Measure,"Boasting a powerhouse cast, The Last Full Measure has the best of intentions, to celebrate servicemen without condoning war, but winds up with little else."
The Last Full Measure,"Here's a true story about a young soldier's exceptional bravery and sacrifice made into a pretty average war movie, insubstantial and TV-ish despite the appearance of some decorated Hollywood veterans."
The Last Full Measure,"In his final role, Fonda is given room to be wonderful - and so, of course, he is."
The Last Full Measure,One of the strengths of Todd Robinson's film lies in the casting of a gallery of fine actors in almost every role.
The Last Full Measure,"Not bad for a regulation military movie, but I must confess to a wandering attention span; how else could I notice the cigarette that Jackson removes from the pack of Marlboros is an American Spirit?"
The Last Full Measure,The meticulous script and sensitive direction signal in Todd Robinson the virtues of a major filmmaker at work.
The Last Full Measure,It's very earnest and very safe. Everyone explains everything that they are thinking in the most poignant way every time. It is very predictable and expected.
The Last Full Measure,"At this point, having every Vietnamese character be a bloodthirsty butcher with no lines reinforces that this feels more like a 1980s TV movie than a considered tribute to a fallen hero"
The Last Full Measure,"A moving and powerful and unforgettable story about the Vietnam War and its aftershocks, in the tradition of ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home."""
The Last Full Measure,Writer/director Todd Robinson spins this tale of heroism with a lot of purple sentiment but surprisingly little of the jingoism expected from a film like this.
The Last Full Measure,"Ultimately, we're just meant to recognize bravery and salute. The movie's not strictly necessary for that."
The Last Full Measure,"In giving U.S. Air Force pararescueman William H. Pitsenbarger, his due, The Last Full Measure occasionally meanders into the maudlin, reined in by a cast that lends some gravity to the melodrama."
The Last Full Measure,"A diligent, well-intentioned, if overheated story."
The Last Full Measure,"Pitsenbarger's story is one worth telling, but ""The Last Full Measure"" is a misfire."
The Last Full Measure,"So many good intentions, so little genuine feeling."
The Last Full Measure,"Unlike that medal that eluded Pitsenbarger's memory for decades, ""The Last Full Measure"" doesn't do its hero justice."
The Last Full Measure,The amazing true story of a soldier's valor in Vietnam takes a back seat to a decades-long tale of bureaucratic incompetence and corruption.
The Last Full Measure,"While its story mechanics are creaky, the valor of Pitsenbarger is evoked cogently, in well-executed battle sequences."
The Last Full Measure,"Although the script and aesthetic are rather melodramatic and oftentimes overly sentimental, the star-studded cast elevates the material with nuanced performances."
The Last Full Measure,A so-so movie with a lot of good parts.
The Last Full Measure,"""The Last Full Measure"" is lost in the fog of war from the moment it starts."
The Last Full Measure,A fact-based drama hampered by unconvincing fictions.
The Last Full Measure,"No amount of marquee talent...can fully compensate for the inert melodrama peddled by this inspired-by-true-events film, which recounts the 1999 campaign to see Pitsenbarger properly feted."
The Last Full Measure,A poignant reevaluation of gallantry and of how survivor's guilt impacts those veterans whose lives were spared.
The Last Full Measure,"Writer-director Todd Robinson is the victim of his own noble intentions, turning each and every moment into an ice bucket of sentiment."
The Last Full Measure,"Despite its flaws, this movie reminds us all of the sacrifices made by soldiers and to be mindful of how we treat them when they come home."
The Last Full Measure,"""The Last Full Measure"" has its poignant moments and boasts a wonderful (if at times histrionic) company of actors, but their message is drowned out in a telling that shouts to be heard when an indoor voice would suffice."
The Last Full Measure,"Todd Robinson... has managed to turn this tribute to a verifiable hero into a plodding, somnolent snooze."
The Last Full Measure,The film largely evades any perspectives that might question the institutions that put our soldiers in harm's way.
Queen & Slim,"Queen & Slim bowls you over with its powerful, charged story. Not one to be missed."
Queen & Slim,"An excellent, hard-hitting new film about race relations in America today..."
Queen & Slim,A thoroughly moral tale told with great flair.
Queen & Slim,"The whole film has this dreamy, heady atmosphere, but despite all the things going on around it and all the things it's about...it is, at its heart, a love story."
Queen & Slim,"As this hot couple unwittingly become Black Lives Matter icons, the provocative script is increasingly peppered with implausible beats and infuriatingly dim decisions but it's worth riding those out to reach the transcendent moments between."
Queen & Slim,"Effortlessly charismatic and oozing chemistry, this is a duo to die for."
Queen & Slim,An intoxicatingly lawless lovers-on-the-run romance played out against the politically charged backdrop of racially divided modern America.
Queen & Slim,Sometimes Queen & Slim is too stylish for its own good and a few detours drag. But how can you find fault with a movie that combines the intelligence of Ava DuVernay's documentary 13th with the madcap energy of True Romance?
Queen & Slim,Simultaneously beautiful and troubling.
Queen & Slim,"Their characters are only loosely sketched, which suits both Kaluuya's watchful, reticent performance - reminiscent of his star-making work in Get Out - and Turner-Smith's lack of experience."
Queen & Slim,"The film just doesn't work, but we'll be intrigued to see what Matsoukas does next."
Queen & Slim,"This is a punchy, watchable film..."
Queen & Slim,Matsoukas has the high style you would expect from a career in music video... But look closer and the pop-culture strut is an inheritance from movie history.
Queen & Slim,"""From whence does fulfillment come?"" Sumney wonders, and Queen & Slim is at its best when it paints portraits of black love and black resistance as answers to that question."
Queen & Slim,"Ultimately, Queen & Slim seems to bolster a belief-women should be quiet and support their men-that's both inherently conservative and especially frustrating given the nature of the lovers-on-the-run genre."
Queen & Slim,"The director's confident patience guides the pacing of Queen & Slim, allowing both the film and the relationship between its titular characters to unfold organically, even as the stakes of the picture are established within its first 15 minutes."
Queen & Slim,It think it is a thrilling debut [for director Melina Matsoukas]... You fall in love with this couple.
Queen & Slim,"Very entertaining in a number of ways. Thrilling, kind of funny... Love these two actors together."
Queen & Slim,It's a Bonnie and Clyde tale worth telling today.
Queen & Slim,"I didn't think I would grow attached to this disparate couple, but both Kaluuya & Turner-Smith are charismatic and the film serves them well. The end may be inevitable to anyone familiar with lovers-on-the-lam stories but it still packs a punch"
Queen & Slim,"It makes bold narrative choices but backs them up with confidence, so there's never any questioning Matsoukas' vision. She's delivered a potent love story for our times."
Queen & Slim,"Fantasy requires a wide berth, but it's not always clear whose fantasy is being worked here."
Queen & Slim,"A sensuous moment is repeatedly, intentionally and frustratingly interrupted by cutaways to a protest, where Black citizens clash violently with police. Even in sex, their pleasure is punctured with the strife and tension facing Black lives."
Queen & Slim,"There's no getting around the appeal of these two characters, as Kaluuya and Turner-Smith play them..."
Queen & Slim,[The] emotionally explosive Queen & Slim is a nightmare romantic thriller ripped straight out of today's headlines.
Queen & Slim,I responded strongly to the film's sense of scope and scale. The 'rhetoric' of Queen & Slim reverberates with anger and love and mourning.
Queen & Slim,"Queen & Slim is one of those increasingly rare movies that should leave audiences discussing it after they exit the theater. Yet if the film derives power from its broader context, there's strength in the journey as well as the destination."
Queen & Slim,Queen & Slim excels as a poetic romance between two virtual strangers.
Queen & Slim,"Investing their roles with a somber thoughtfulness, the leads do exquisite work, even when the situation pushes them toward bad decisions or stereotypes."
Queen & Slim,"Without the medicine, Queen & Slim is just digging around in the wound."
Queen & Slim,Queen & Slim artfully weaves together a lovers-on-the-lam crime story with very trenchant Black Lives Matter thematic content. It is a perfect movie for our times.
Queen & Slim,"Game-changing work from screenwriter Lena Waithe, director Melina Matsoukas and actors Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith turn this tale of an outlaw couple on the run in Trump's racially charged America into incendiary protest art"
Queen & Slim,"Queen & Slim is more interested in myth-making than storytelling, and viewers who don't care that much about the latter just might buy into the former."
Queen & Slim,"""Queen & Slim"" has more than a few dialogue clangers and narrative contrivances... but the felicitous pairing of Turner-Smith and Kaluuya makes the flaws easy to forgive."
Queen & Slim,"Matsoukas, working from a script by Lena Waithe and story by James Frey, keeps the pace so leisurely over the course of 132 minutes that the story's innate tension slowly seeps away like air in an old balloon."
Queen & Slim,"This movie feels like something new, and also as if it's been around forever, waiting for its moment."
Queen & Slim,"Fueled by pain and anger, fortified by strength and resolve, ""Queen & Slim"" is a righteous movie - one that's angry about America's refusal to confront the sins of racism and mournful about the enduring legacy of slavery."
Queen & Slim,"The movie burns with outrage, but its inability to express itself clearly can be maddening."
Queen & Slim,"""Queen & Slim"" has a remarkable power. You watch it recognizing the world you know, and wishing you didn't."
Queen & Slim,"""Queen & Slim"" is a powerful look at places and issues not often explored in movies, and it's unusual for being a big studio film starring two people of color created by people of color."
Queen & Slim,"Maybe it's inevitable that the film ends up feeling like an extremely diluted combination of Matsoukas' two most famous music videos, crossing the political imagery of Beyoncé's ""Formation"" with the outlaw imagery of Rihanna's ""We Found Love""..."
Queen & Slim,"It's an adrenaline shot right to the heart, and a bold declaration of a bright new auteur."
Queen & Slim,"This haphazard film is a ride, a romantic provocation torn between cultural strife and individual striving."
Queen & Slim,The movie's subject deserved better.
Queen & Slim,"Queen & Slim is on its own path. Groundbreaking for its rich, layered storytelling, stylish direction, provocative contemplations on race and police abuse and two performances that will redefine how black men and women are portrayed on screen."
Queen & Slim,"Matsoukas... finds two first-rate performances in Kaluuya and Turner-Smith. Theirs is one of the more carefully paced romances in recent memory, and the subtle way their tension switches from fear to desire is masterful."
Queen & Slim,"Queen & Slim's ultimate route is a powerful one - a drive meant to be shared, and discussed, long after the road ends."
Queen & Slim,"At its best, ""Queen & Slim"" isn't just a crime drama but a nuanced portrayal of family, legacy and self-preservation - how they're distorted by trauma and history, and how they thrive despite the near-constant threat of annihilation."
Queen & Slim,"See it for the arrivals of a directorial talent and a stunning young actress, and see it to remind yourself of this country's ancient and eternal sins."
Queen & Slim,"The pain, the passion, and the urgency at the movie's core emerge forcefully and movingly."
Queen & Slim,"For a spell, Melina Matsoukas's film exudes the concision of an old B movie."
Queen & Slim,Queen & Slim is a masterclass.
Queen & Slim,"It's tempting to fall for, thanks to impeccable work from Matsoukas and Kaluuya, but by the end, for a film so focused on love, I wanted to feel a bit more of it."
Queen & Slim,"Not only reframes an outlaws-on-the-run story in thrillingly contemporary, culturally relevant terms, but also finds a way to do so that combines bracing honesty about a hostile world with lyrical beauty about the relationships that make it endurable."
Queen & Slim,"Queen & Slim taps into a current of social outrage and depicts it with vehemence, sympathy and two true artists' visions melded into one."
Queen & Slim,Melina Matsoukas' powerful debut feature is a meditation and celebration of the Black experience and an at-times searing condemnation of an apathetic white America.
Queen & Slim,"Queen & Slim tackles urgent, difficult subjects with bravery, care and adrenalised genre cool. But it triumphs because it shows you the personal toll beyond the politics. And how black lives brimming with potential can still turn on one fateful moment."
Queen & Slim,"""Queen & Slim"" embodies a troubling historical moment not in spite of its puzzling twists and messy circumstances, but because of them."
Queen & Slim,A road trip that zigzags between the lyrical and the heavy-handed.
Queen & Slim,"[Matsoukas] sees an opportunity to turn these two fictional characters into vigilante heroes, or martyrs for a cause, or both, and rather than play it frisky and in-your-face, she goes for iconic."
TÁR,"Trap Jazz reveals the creative process of musicians Chris Moten, Cassius Jay, and Devon ""Stixx"" Taylor as they construct a sound full of both historic weight and contemporary flair. But it also explores the nature of legacy..."

It's a Wonderful Life,ERROR
Emily,Despite strong visual appeal and a star performance from Emma Mackey this rendering of the Brontë family saga gets almost everything wrong.
Emily,"If one does not look to Emily to adhere too faithfully to historical truth or, indeed, to depict what actual writing is like, then it is a satisfying—or at least benign—story."
Emily,I thoroughly enjoyed this film -- which looks and feels a lot like Wuthering Heights.
Emily,"“Emily” is a good, engrossing watch, and it avoids most (but not all) of the genre’s pitfalls."
Emily,O'Connor and Mackey together bring their subject to new heights.
Emily,Purists are not going to be pleased... But for the rest of us this fantasy does offer the satisfaction of witnessing the short-lived triumph of a fascinating character.
Emily,"It feels more like an effort to make us curious about this woman, whether or not we know or care who she is. And from the moment we see her, we are indeed inclined to be curious. That’s how you know it works."
Emily,Emma Mackey is utterly magnetic.
Emily,"A film that doesn’t want to be bound — much like its central character — to one genre or one overall conceit. And that lifts Emily far above other recent, more staid and comfortable biopics."
Emily,Frances O’Connor makes a striking directorial debut with a provocatively revisionist biography of Emily Brontë.
Emily,"Although there’s nothing especially wrong with Emily, little in the movie causes it to stand apart from other, similar productions."
Emily,I’ll tell you who I’d love to have watched this movie with — Emily Bronte. But I doubt she’d have lasted 20 minutes. They say she had a temper. Her review would have been a lot harsher than mine.
Emily,"A film about the gifted, strange Brontë sister that mingles fact with imagination to depict Emily’s adult years."
Emily,[An] imaginative leap.
Emily,A bold and audacious retelling of Emily Brontë’s life starring an uncommonly compelling Emma Mackey.
Emily,A portrait that feels in some sense true and also make viewers so engaged that they’re hungry to learn more about the subject.
Emily,"O’Connor is hardly bound by history, yet with “Emily” she’s clearly more interested in finding the emotional truth of Emily Brontë’s life than in merely reciting the facts."
Emily,Paints a haunting and sympathetic portrait of the person she might have been.
Emily,"O’Connor’s Emily overcomes her quirks, engages her desire, and fulfills her passions—and then some."
Emily,"Without plunging into full anachronism, the film happily plays both fast and loose with history, its tone frequently wobbling between melodrama, magic realism, and the more traditional structures of classic period drama."
Emily,[Brontë] deserves more than this biopic’s utter lack of interest in the very thing that made her immortal. Emily is a movie about “writing” that’s forgotten how to read.
Emily,"O’Connor’s liberties work for a story that, above all, is about art as an act of radical sovereignty."
Emily,A movie that delights in hurling caution and historical fidelity to the Yorkshire wind.
Emily,Emily takes advantage of the leeway for speculation afforded by its subject’s reclusive nature.
Emily,"This is an auspicious directorial debut for O’Connor, who was born in Britain but who moved to Australia with her parents when she was two years old."
Emily,"This is the way you hope things might have been for Emily simply because it makes her more human. Rather than being an ethereal character entirely caught up in the realms of her own imagination, it puts her in touch with the world the rest of us inhabit."
Emily,"Emma Mackey’s appealing performance, a combination of defiance, depth and vulnerability, brings to life an obscured literary figure."
Emily,"Emma Mackey is very good, but I just don’t think the story does the writer justice, or goes in any particularly interesting places given the stature of the people portrayed. A missed opportunity."
Emily,O’Connor clearly isn’t afraid of rattling cages when approaching sacred texts. There’s something refreshingly untethered about the gusto with which she reimagines Emily...
Emily,"It’s well played and well written, but it’s an odd addition to a story that is remarkable even without invention: studios need to start letting spinsters be spinsters."
Emily,"Mackey, in particular, is a powerhouse. The young star is matched well with O’Connor’s carefully calibrated, appealingly earnest script, which approximates a modern sensibility without striking a false note or straying from Emily’s contemporaneous moors."
Emily,A stark and plaintive elegy for the best of all Brontës.
Emily,"E mma Mackey is splendiferous in this frequently scintillating and teen-friendly biopic about Wuthering Heights author Emily Brontë. That said, much about Frances O’Connor’s directing debut is disappointing."
Emily,"Taking all kinds of liberties with the biographical facts, Frances O’Connor’s debut as a writer-director (she’s best known as an actor) nevertheless posits a quite plausible version of Emily."
Emily,"Emily, pointedly, does not wallow in the misery we like to ascribe to her short and frequently tragic life. There is great buoyancy and humour in the film."
Emily,"It’s a ""speculative biopic,"" and modern, but there’s no Billie Eilish on the soundtrack or breaking of the fourth wall or jokey intertitles or any of those larks, which is a mighty relief. Instead, it’s daring, and ravishing."
Emily,"[Reduces] artistic inspiration to book-group talking points and dreamy what-ifs. But this debut feature from the actor-turned-director Frances O’Connor still contains striking material amid the poppycock, and even ’fesses up to its own futility."
Emily,"Had he lived to see it, this is a movie scene that I think Yorkshireman Ted Hughes would have loved. It is a real achievement for O’Connor."
Emily,"If O’Connor’s aim was to recreate a British classic, she has surely failed to reach those lofty heights. Mackey shows further signs of promise, but she’ll be better off elsewhere."
Emily,"O’Connor's debut is ambitious for sure, but with imagery ripped from countless better period set films, an overbearing score from Abel Korzeniowski, and an outdated way of pitting women against each other. . .Emily’s legacy deserves better than this."
Emily,"With 'Emily,' actor-turned-director Frances O’Connor has crafted a first film that feels like the work of an accomplished master."
Emily,A ravishing period drama that plays fast and loose with the facts in order to paint a portrait of the author that bleeds with the same heart-in-its-hands emotionality she had to suffuse into her work.
Emily,"The film feels a little too long, but it gives an involving perspective on Brontë’s interior life, exploring themes such as gender, independence, creativity, mental health and sexuality."
Emily,"Mackey commands the screen, confidently shepherding us through Emily’s mercurial moods. Her eyes — darting nervously at one moment, squinting suspiciously at another — tells us what dialogue can’t."
Emily,"The film empowers Brontë’s sometimes turbulent emotions, setting environments according to the author’s moods in ways that can be riveting."
Bombshell,"By failing to contextualize their race and class, Bombshell overlooks how complicated the real women who ousted Roger Ailes are."
Bombshell,Bombshell doubles down on the myth that victims must be perfect to be considered victims.
Bombshell,This superbly acted Faustian tale may inhabit the world of white privilege but it is terrific at unpicking the workplace sexism millions of ordinary women face every day.
Bombshell,"It's Bombshell's modus operandi that female leads are continually explaining things to men, but the women-only interactions are the strongest - epitomised by a moment when Gretchen, Megyn and Kayla silently share the same lift."
Bombshell,It's this element of recoil from total sympathy with these harassed women that makes the film intriguing though.
Bombshell,"Bombshell is a fine enough movie, one that's entertaining and well-paced when you're watching it but forgettable as soon as you leave the theatre."
Bombshell,What happened to these women is appalling; that the film takes such pains to sand down the politics of its central characters to make them more sympathetic undermines its entire thesis.
Bombshell,"Thanks to the exceptional cast and the witty, smart direction, the story of what happened such a short time ago is both bitterly entertaining and unashamedly provocative."
Bombshell,"Because the performances are as good as they are, you completely buy into the unfolding drama."
Bombshell,[A] timely satirical takedown that finds black humour and absurdist comedy in the subject of workplace sexual harassment while never losing sight of its devastating repercussions.
Bombshell,"[Charlize] Theron, [Nicole] Kidman and [Margot] Robbie are highly watchable performers who are hardly stretched by this material."
Bombshell,"Deep at points but paper-thin at others, the film skips over questions of complicity, and pulls some of its punches, especially politically. But it's still an engaging look at life behind the scenes of one of the weirdest workplaces in existence..."
Bombshell,"[Director Jay Roach] and Randolph are rightly fascinated by the social climate and geography of the Fox offices -- the factions, hierarchies, protocols and rivalries that define the place."
Bombshell,Disingenuous trash.
Bombshell,"Bombshell avoids a big bang in favour of a firm commitment to a screenplay that succumbs to occasional theatrics, but understands the nuances of sexism, harassment and #MeToo."
Bombshell,It's fun to watch powerful men get destroyed. What's not fun is watching bad people take down worse people for self-serving reasons and get treated as heroes for doing it.
Bombshell,"An absolute toilet fire of a movie, a sub-HBO-movie effort comprised of winking storytelling tricks, 'SNL'-level celebrity impersonation, and kiddie pool-deep interrogation of the figures at its center."
Bombshell,"Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, John Lithgow at the top of their game in a solid recap of sexual harassment at Fox News."
Bombshell,"With Bombshell, thanks in large part to the contributions of his actors, Roach has crafted a compelling ""ripped from the headlines"" motion picture that unfolds like a page-turner."
Bombshell,"""Bombshell"" isn't always as explosive as it would like to be, but it definitely makes an impact."
Bombshell,It may be difficult to divorce the Fox News of it all - something that never really gets indicted in the same way as Ailes' behavior - but it's still a story worth telling.
Bombshell,"This is rich territory, but Bombshell treads lightly, and as a result the film feels thin."
Bombshell,The film as a whole suffers from tunnel vision. Charles Randolph's screenplay is so tightly focused on happenings at Fox News that if you didn't follow the players in this real-life drama-and I didn't-you may find it difficult to care.
Bombshell,"The abuse depicted is shocking, but ""Bombshell"" is surprisingly entertaining."
Bombshell,"It fractures attention with multiple urgent distractions, much like the Fox News television environment it recreates and consciously mimics."
Bombshell,Bombshell's ultimate punch lands more like a spectacular bottle rocket than a scorching Molotov cocktail.
Bombshell,"[A] film that's both soberly, sympathetically thoughtful and bristling with the energy of its high-powered setting."
Bombshell,"The level of naiveté required to cap off a story like Bombshell's with an inspiring, ""Women rule!"" pop anthem is unfathomable to me."
Bombshell,"Ultimately, the film's unwillingness to go deeper makes it fall flat."
Bombshell,"For its part, ""Bombshell"" tells a crucial chapter of that larger tale with coolheaded style and heated indignation. Its aim might be narrow, but it hits the target."
Bombshell,"Holds your attention without really getting into anything too risky or, in the case of Theron's Kelly, remotely skeptical."
Bombshell,[Bombshell] does nothing aside from retread old material with A-list stars in Halloween costumes.
Bombshell,"The three women are as riveting as always and they are surrounded by surprise ""guest"" appearances..."
Bombshell,"Despite an overly polished and broad approach, the film is ultimately a persuasive portrait, guided by strong performances from Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman as anchors who decide they can stay silent no longer."
Bombshell,This movie's funny... [But] I don't think it ought to be so funny.
Bombshell,"You don't have to like Kelly, Carlson, or the fictitious Pospisil to feel something for these women, intelligent, gifted professionals undermined by a controlling creep. But you're always aware of their relative privilege, too."
Bombshell,"As often occurs with topical tales, which are hellbent on catching a widespread mood (in this instance, anger and disgust), there's something hasty and undigested about ""Bombshell."""
Bombshell,"For a movie that wants to celebrate the courage it takes to uncover ugly truths and take down corrupt powers, Bombshell turns out to be awfully timid."
Bombshell,"""Roach and Randolph made this film to preach to a choir that already have their minds made up."""
Bombshell,"It has a few strong moments, mostly courtesy of Robbie, but it's both underwhelming and overworked, inelegantly structured and missing something fundamental at the core."
Bombshell,The tone starts off as knowingly satirical and ends on an unearned note of inspirational earnestness.
Bombshell,"Here's the thing about sexism: It doesn't discriminate. It's an equal opportunity prejudice that cuts across history, culture, political affiliation. ""Bombshell"" gets this."
Bombshell,"A ferociously entertaining dramatization of how an unlikely group of women exposed and deposed media titan Roger Ailes, it is as harrowing as it is triumphant in its depiction of the way it all came to pass."
Bombshell,"It does cartwheels to make a vile tale compelling, and it can feel like a parade of starry impressions rather than something genuine. But to quote Ailes in the film, ""It's a visual medium."""
Bombshell,"Much like Vice, Roach's [Bombshell] is a display of fantastic acting and hilarious comedy, but doesn't pass as the historical documentary it wishes to be."
Bombshell,"""Bombshell"" actively denies our natural desire for identification with a hero. [Kelly] occupies a space that is hero, victim and at times, villain, and it's a bold move for Theron and the filmmakers to make Kelly as challenging as she is."
Bombshell,A movie with a compelling story to tell turns into a blunt-force polemic that can't stop hammering its message home.
Bombshell,"Theron, Kidman, and Robbie-all nominees for Screen Actors Guild awards-come out blazing in this tale of how the women of Fox News brought down a predatory CEO. It's explosive entertainment that means to make a difference. Listen up."
Bombshell,Bombshell doesn't really try to explore the moral complexity it sets up.
Bombshell,"Ace casting shouldn't distract from the main issue: Unlikely, and in some cases, unlikeable women can change the game."
Bombshell,A whirlwind tour through one of American television's sleazier episodes.
Bombshell,Bombshell is both light on its feet and a punch in the gut.
Bombshell,"One of the many strong points of ""Bombshell"" is that its pioneering truthfulness doesn't devolve into polemics, and it's not didactic."
Bombshell,"The material is worthy, but this continuing struggle deserves a more nuanced take."
Bombshell,"Kelly becomes the centerpiece of the story, thanks in large part to the uncanny performance by Theron... It's about as dazzling a portrayal of a living person as you'll see."
Bombshell,"They didn't want to leave anyone out, and they didn't want to make anyone mad. As a result, a genuinely explosive story never detonates with the force it should."
Bombshell,"""Bombshell"" is a lurid, cartoonish romp, marred by rough and sometimes overbearing flourishes, but not without a tragicomic soul. That alone makes it a genuine movie of the moment."
Bombshell,"""Bombshell"" paints an accurate portrait of the culture of silence that enables male entitlement against women, yet it seems unsure of the right way to handle conservative hypocrisies perpetuating that very toxicity."
Bombshell,"If you've already accepted that treating your coworkers as sexual objects is bad, you're unlikely to be shocked by Bombshell's accusations, or enlightened by its insights."
Bombshell,"Bombshell is a hard and complicated story to tell, but its message is clear: no woman is free from the patriarchy, even if she doesn't believe in it."
Bombshell,"Bombshell won't be the last #MeToo film, but it speaks astutely to this moment."
Bombshell,"Bombshell belongs to its three main female stars. It's their fierce, finely shaded performances that transcend the film's drab visual style and drier episodic moments..."
Bombshell,"One of the most compelling stories of the #MeToo movement is told unflinchingly, empathetically and authentically, with Charlize Theron completely nailing the knotty character of Megyn Kelly."
Bombshell,"Bombshell is a bright, watchable film on a subject that ought to make us squirm."
Bombshell,"Whatever beliefs they may hold about other people's humanity, I'm glad these women finally received justice from the network that wronged them. I'm just not sure that translates into wanting to spend two hours in their company."
Bombshell,The drama about a very serious subject shoves aside insight in favor of cartoonish impersonations of Fox News personalities.
Bombshell,"It is a strange film in some ways, speckled with powerful, insightful moments but also with some strained acting, pulled punches and fudged attitudes, unable to decide if its heroines are compromised through having been loyal Fox staffers."
Bombshell,"While uneven at times, the film is similarly sharp and savvy as director Jay Roach's other political fare, ""Game Change"" and ""Recount."""
Bombshell,"A smart, snappy depiction of the Fox News ogre getting his comeuppance."
Bombshell,"It's easy enough to rip a story from the headlines, but not so easy to make it stick. ""Bombshell"" has a finely textured, savagely pinpoint, you-are-there verisimilitude..."
Bombshell,"While some might have some misgivings over its more comedic aspects, there is still a lot to admire about a film that manages to successfully highlight the similarities between the current administration and a media empire's seemingly untouchable status."
Ford v. Ferrari,"[Ford v Ferrari] may relish in the high life, but its final moments feel devastatingly hollow."
Ford v. Ferrari,"While Ford v. Ferrari finishes first on a technical level, it serves as a myopic altar to a sport and era of white-male dominance."
Ford v. Ferrari,You see the concentration. You see the sweat. You see the danger. You see the madness.
Ford v. Ferrari,Ford v Ferrari is a little too long; some scenes leave unnecessary skidmark trails. But the movie still has amiable style and energy to spare. It's fast but never furious.
Ford v. Ferrari,"Think Iron Man and Captain America, only it's a (mostly) true story and what's at stake is not the fate of the universe, nor even an auto race, but the glorious, endless pursuit of perfection."
Ford v. Ferrari,It is a beautifully controlled and assembled piece of filmmaking.
Ford v. Ferrari,"While the movie has its share of racetrack thrills in keeping with a cinematic tradition that began with the silent classic Ben Hur, it's the personal and professional friendship between [Carroll] Shelby and [Ken] Miles that gives the movie traction."
Ford v. Ferrari,"It's a far from perfect film, but a richly entertaining one, with a twist that only devoted petrolheads will know is coming."
Ford v. Ferrari,"It's still impeccably made, with Mangold distilling the story into two essential parts: the thrill of the game, and the thrill of watching people who are good at their jobs do their jobs."
Ford v. Ferrari,"There's still lots to enjoy about the film, which provides us with two wonderful lead performances, exciting speed races, and car executives wearing some of the most beautifully tailored suits this side of Mad Men."
Ford v. Ferrari,"The film weathers its two-and-a-half-hour running time easily, even as it navigates a cheerfully formulaic sports movie structure."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Hitting the screen like a shot of pure unfiltered adrenaline, director James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari is an outstanding historical character study."
Ford v. Ferrari,Ford v Ferrari takes the straightforward ethos of car racing-where the winner is whoever is the fastest-and lays bare the egotism and greed required for such a triumph.
Ford v. Ferrari,"This film has no ambition except to entertain, and it does so exceedingly well. That's not something I take for granted."
Ford v. Ferrari,Mangold takes Ford v. Ferrari out of the simple realm of the genre without entirely losing the vibe.
Ford v. Ferrari,Even Henry Ford II gets the message here: Sometimes you have to go along with the ride.
Ford v. Ferrari,"One of the best ensemble casts of the year, in one of the best movies ever made about auto racing."
Ford v. Ferrari,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is made the way Hollywood used to make them, a glorious throwback that combines a smart modern sensibility with the best of traditional storytelling."
Ford v. Ferrari,I bought into [Matt Damon's] character completely... The race sequences are terrific.
Ford v. Ferrari,"It's a new and emotionally complex model of an old-fashioned audience-pleaser, with wonderful performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon and a resonant soul to go with its smarts."
Ford v. Ferrari,"It is, all in all, a pleasant surprise. Partly because Christian Bale and Matt Damon, the lead actors, are really good, and are supported by a fine cast that includes Tracy Letts in one of the best and least-expected crying scenes of the year."
Ford v. Ferrari,"It's a satisfying, occasionally exhilarating film, but one which is naggingly risk-averse, and also maybe one which doesn't bother itself too much with the interior lives of its characters."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Whether you care about motorsports or not, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a kick: both a rollicking true story well told, and a moving depiction of male friendship."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Ford V Ferrari isn't quite as witty or elegiac as it could be, but it does have a pragmatist's sense of satisfaction in doing meaningful, enjoyable work while maneuvering around the limitations of an unfeeling corporate world."
Ford v. Ferrari,"With a great cast, fascinating story and old-school studio vibe, Ford v. Ferrari nearly clicks on all cylinders."
Ford v. Ferrari,"The large screen fizzes with spectacle, drenchingly vivid in the night rain of the climactic race, while speech-balloonish close-ups of Miles are intercut, issuing the ""Giddy ups!"" and the ""That's my girls!"""
Ford v. Ferrari,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is ultimately a story of the way human ingenuity can be subsumed by corporate practice... underneath the hood of the muscle car madness is a surprisingly radical treatise on the corporate exploitation of human labor."
Ford v. Ferrari,"""Ford v Ferrari"" works as a stylish, enjoyable mash note to its era, and the need for speed and all that."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Vroom! Damon and Bale bring engine-roaring life to this true tale of two racing legends hired by Henry Ford II to build a hot, fast car that can beat Ferrari at Le Mans and pit American crass against Italian class. Fasten your seat belts."
Ford v. Ferrari,"With a staggering two-and-a-half-hour runtime, you'd think director James Mangold would have delved more deeply into the interior lives of its two protagonists in order to ground their narrative in something other than adrenaline and testosterone."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Mangold gives viewers the thrill of being behind the wheel of a race car at 7,000 RPMs, but maintains a steady balance between the technical and human sides of his story."
Ford v. Ferrari,"It's behind the wheel with Miles that ""Ford v Ferrari"" becomes a well-oiled entertainment machine, a thrill ride with a driver's-eye view of the world's most exciting track. Everything that doesn't work is just a distant speck in the rearview mirror."
Ford v. Ferrari,"This is certainly not a film for our times. Drawn from recent history, it's a nostalgic celebration of gas-guzzling fast cars and the people who risked their lives racing them. Yet it's wholly seductive."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Ironically, for a story about men creating outside the box, it's pretty formulaic. But there's a glorious, old-fashioned sense of nostalgia about this hunk of Americana that suggests director James Mangold grew up on the Herbie movies."
Ford v. Ferrari,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is what it promises to be, a blast from the past."
Ford v. Ferrari,"A mid-1960s corporate rivalry may not seem like the stuff of fist-pumping, crowd-pleasing cinema, yet the battle is sketched with such élan, all high-gloss surfaces, scotch-swilling intrigue and rat-a-tat dialogue, that it's impossible not to be drawn in."
Ford v. Ferrari,"No matter if you're not into speedy vehicles and sports movies: Mangold's film is a testament to taking on The Man - in this case, a Detroit auto powerhouse - and having a buddy's back even when he hits you with a loaf of Wonder Bread."
Ford v. Ferrari,"It's a film about pride-about being as proud of your own flesh and blood as you are of your metal machines, and about the craziness that flares up whenever pride gets hurt."
Ford v. Ferrari,Old-fashioned in all the right ways. Truly the type of film Hollywood rarely makes these days.
Ford v. Ferrari,"Directed by James Mangold, with a slavish appreciation of formula, it's the perfect movie event of the year. If that year was 1955."
Ford v. Ferrari,"The film lacks speed... and can feel like an indulgent rummage in car-history ephemera, albeit a smart, colourful and certainly expensive one."
Ford v. Ferrari,"No points for knowing who takes the racing trophy, or for knowing which version of Ford v Ferrari -- the half-smart business fable or the rough-and-ready boys' own adventure -- ultimately wins you over."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Mangold's talent for action comes alive, though, during the thrilling racing sequences, and Tracy Letts is having lots of fun with his portrayal of Henry Ford II. Yet the overall production is too cautiously steered."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Though a mite long, Ford v Ferrari is so thrillingly well made that it's only later, when your pulse slows, that you see how formulaic it is. But formulas are made to be overhauled, and this film has some fascinating upgrades."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Had to catch my breath after this one. The performances are phenomenal as expected but the technical craftsmanship is next-level. The riveting visuals, expert editing, the sound design and that Marco Beltrami score!"
Ford v. Ferrari,"James Mangold has such confidence in Ford v Ferrari, the performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale are so solid, and the aesthetics so good that you'll steadily get drawn in."
Ford v. Ferrari,A full-bodied and exciting true-life story in which the men behind the wheels are just as dynamic as the machines they drive.
Ford v. Ferrari,The story's great and the racetrack action leaves skid marks on the eyeballs.
Ford v. Ferrari,"Somehow, Mangold has made a two and half hour movie out of this rather dry-sounding source material, and most pleasingly, it's entertaining even to someone with absolutely no skin in the racing game."
Ford v. Ferrari,"At a time when the nation continues to weigh the fate of its auto industry, James Mangold's depiction of the Ford Motor Company facing its first major financial threat transparently plays to nostalgic reveries of the industry's golden age."
Ford v. Ferrari,"I imagine many viewers will be more than happy to be whisked away by ""Ford v Ferrari."""
Ford v. Ferrari,"Mangold does well to maintain a sense of peril as well as make the 24 Hours of Le Mans race something that's visually compelling and exciting, even to those not enthusiastic about the sport."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Great-looking, handsomely produced but tiringly acted and inert..."
Ford v. Ferrari,"A big, glossy crowd-pleaser of a film, high on horsepower, engine grease, and clean-sweat '60s masculinity."
Ford v. Ferrari,"Ford V. Ferrari is a good ride, and a good example of what so many people are thirsty for."
Ford v. Ferrari,Excels at evoking the sheer thrill of the race...and it's compelling enough in those moments to make the case that nothing beats the thrill of competition.
Ford v. Ferrari,A '60s-set adrenaline rusher with top-shelf technical craftsmanship.
Ford v. Ferrari,"The best sports movies aren't so much about the sport as they are the personalities, and these two go big with their performances..."
Downhill,ERROR
Emma.,"Very witty and well-acted... Emma has been adapted a number of times, but this has enough intelligence in its adaptation to stand out from the crowd."
Emma.,"If anyone were to push Emma Woodhouse into a less straitened age, why not the woman who captured Childish Gambino in a palm-tree polyblend?"
Emma.,"While the story's sturdy, familiar structure remains resonant, this version never feels particularly inspired or revelatory, despite some lovely moments scattered throughout."
Emma.,"Austen's genius lay in turning one girl's interior world into the whole universe, and transforming the pettiest of social interactions into microcosms with global moral significance."
Emma.,"The movie is handsomely mounted and consistently engaging. Yes, the story is familiar but part of the charm is seeing how key scenes have been re-envisioned by the filmmakers."
Emma.,There's a real energy to this adaptation.
Emma.,"Emma. is deeply satisfying watch that, while lacking the contemporary feel of Amy Heckerling's Austen adaptation Clueless, is charming and lovely in its own right."
Emma.,Emma. pulls off a wonderful oxymoron: It's a substantial confection. I delighted in nearly every minute of it.
Emma.,It allows this sort of recognizable humanity because so often I think [with period pieces] it's really easy to get lost in the corsets and the wigs... The human element of it really pays off.
Emma.,"Emma is such a complete character that those around her often pale, but de Wilde's casting is downright vivacious."
Emma.,"It takes a while for ""Emma."" to find its groove but once it gets there it's a delight. The source material is too good to disappoint."
Emma.,The romantic tension builds nicely in a lush-looking new adaptation.
Emma.,"This version of Emma is an amusing, pastel-coloured movie which fully embraces the rhythm of Austen's dialogue."
Emma.,"Like Knightley, we find Emma exasperating, but that's no reason to turn away from her. Witty, wry, spry, and deliciously and effortlessly romantic, this is Austen as she is supposed to be."
Emma.,"Love may or may not make the world go round, but Austen's trick - repeated here by de Wilde - is in making us believe, for a minute, that matters of the heart matter more than anything else on Earth."
Emma.,"Directed by Autumn de Wilde, the new ""Emma."" - note that whimsical period - begins disastrously before righting itself to an acceptable tilt."
Emma.,"The movie is fine, and so is its Emma, Anya Taylor-Joy, but the standout is Bill Nighy in the small role of the main character's hypochondriac father."
Emma.,"This lively adaptation plays up the novel's more farcical elements, granting it a snappy, rhythmic pace."
Emma.,"It's clear that de Wilde adores Emma, for all her challenges, just as much as her fictional admirers. And audiences should fall in love with her again, too."
Emma.,All this adds up to a movie filled with that simple yet rare thing: pure pleasure. This film is both a loving homage to Austen and a celebration of fashion and decorative arts.
Emma.,"It's funnier than most Austen adaptations and more visually beautiful, and then there's the movie's odd tone, which combines a rigorous attention to period detail with an arch and seemingly modern sensibility."
Emma.,"The movie strains at the outset; the early scenes are dominated by a brisk procession of tidy, somewhat static shots, set into motion by some intrusive music and editing. Then, rather miraculously, it starts getting better and better."
Emma.,"Mr. Knightley has some brave moments, but Emma is the only character I like in general. Perhaps that partly explains why this film doesn't work for me."
Emma.,"Visually luscious, with endless, exquisite period detail.... briskly edited, almost a door-slamming farce at times, with literally cheeky touches."
Emma.,[Director Autumn de Wilde's] eye for framing and for capturing the best performances from people (whether in still or moving form) is on full display here.
Emma.,"Although it remains a classic literary adaptation faithful to its source, it is absolutely of its own time too."
Emma.,"It feels so alive, fresh, and new like you've never seen before."
Emma.,"This new ""Emma."" -- yes, with a period affixed to the name -- is one that knows in its bones that Austen wrote the first great teen comedy, and runs with that joyfully."
Emma.,"Feels both modern and authentic in the best way, inviting everyone, diehard Austenites and newbies alike, into its embrace."
Emma.,Autumn de Wilde's approach to this tale of frenzied and complicated social activity is both elegant and comedic.
Emma.,"This is one of those films which begin haltingly and, bit by bit, develop a smooth stride."
Emma.,"This Emma seems to regard those around her less as people in need of her skills, more like butterflies she can't wait to pin down to a decorative board for her own amusement."
Emma.,"De Wilde's stylish, stylized Emma. doesn't rewrite the Austen playbook, but it shakes it up a bit-emphasizing the stakes of Emma's careless meddling and adding a spiky 21st-century sensibility to Austen's 19th-century ode to checking your privilege."
Emma.,"""Emma"" partisans, fortunately, never say die, and a very satisfying new version of Austen's sprightly novel has been directed in high style by Autumn de Wilde."
Emma.,"Its textures and colors are exotic, and its star, Anya Taylor-Joy, fills the title role with precocious grace. What's missing is nuance, connective tissue, and depth of feeling."
Emma.,"This is the first feature from the photographer and music-video director Autumn de Wilde, and while she has an obvious eye for beauty, she has an equally sharp eye for the absurd."
Emma.,"As Emma's plans stutter forward and amusingly slip off course, the filmmakers' mild interventions feel less forced, more organic; even a seductive dance and an importunate nosebleed end up working nicely."
Emma.,"All of which adds up to a very comical, very humanist take on Emma."
Emma.,Emma. occupies a perplexing if ultimately pleasurable spot on the Austen industrial complex's twin axes of faithful/revisionist and realistic/stylized.
Emma.,"Everything is heightened reality. The colors are brighter, the characters played in childish ways...it will play well, and what it comes down to is than an Austen novel is like a beautifully-written song."
Emma.,"Tart, bright, and utterly intoxicating."
Emma.,"A rather routine translation of Austen's work, told with just enough flair and attention to detail to make it stand out."
Emma.,"The luminous Anya Taylor-Joy turns this gorgeously filmed, deliciously wicked, and sometimes wounding film version of Jane Austen's literary classic into something that speaks to the current moment and knocks the stuffing out of costume drama."
Emma.,"Its composition leads to a stark formality that's overall cold in tone, with the question of just whom this new version is meant to appeal to left lingering like a light spring breeze."
Emma.,"All Jane Austen's heroines are clever, but Anya Taylor-Joy brings an unusually sharp edge to her rendition of Emma Woodhouse in ""Emma."""
Emma.,"In the lead role, Anya Taylor-Joy creates an admirably spiky character who is less likable than some of her screen predecessors, and all the better for it."
Emma.,"A sweet natured Emma, though a little too modest."
Emma.,"In the immortal words of Cher Horowitz... ""As if!"""
Emma.,"It should be a delicious chocolate gateau but Emma. makes heavy weather of Austen's charmer, delivering a tonally uneven, mostly airless affair."
Emma.,Jane Austen speaks to us as clearly now as she did some 200 years ago. Maybe what is retro isn't so retro after all.
Emma.,The overpowering prettiness is welcome in the windy months. But the characters are lost in a busy rush to find some new angle (any new angle).
Emma.,[Autumn] de Wilde seems at a loss for what to do with the camera and isn't always in control of what she shows us.
Emma.,Taylor Joy suits the mood and Goth brings otherworldly charm to Harriet. The men are where it creaks.
Emma.,"This Emma is pleasant enough in passing, and nothing if not scenically lush. I just couldn't get on with its Emma at all."
Emma.,"Now American photographer Autumn de Wilde, directing for the first time, raises the bar to a new level, thanks to the grandeur of this version's design, the deftness with which she orchestrates its absurdities, and the wit of the screenplay."
Emma.,"Eleanor Catton's script excellently draws out the darker realities of this gilded cage, with its brutally strict social hierarchies - while a recurrent flock of red-hooded seminary girls flag up the true position of women in this claustrophobic patriarchy"
Emma.,"It's ... a decadent, fondant-swaddled delight."
Emma.,Autumn de Wilde puts a subtly contemporary stamp on 'Emma' and there's a message here for the Insta generation.
Emma.,"""Emma"" only grows more assured as its namesake loses her balance, the pastel splendor of Christopher Blauvelt's cinematography and the vocabulary-defying genius of costume designer Alexandra Byrne endowing this classic story with a new energy all its own."
Emma.,Proof that bringing a timeless book and fresh talent together is still a worthy kind of artistic matchmaking.
Emma.,"Emma, with all her preening, gossipy self-love, is somehow the perfect Instagram-age heroine. Her actions in this adaptation and with Taylor-Joy's characterisation are not those of a giddy romantic obsessive, but of an unapologetic, empowered woman."
Emma.,"A largely faithful and unchallenging adaptation, beautifully staged and sharply acted by a cast adept at balancing wit and romance."
Emma.,de Wilde is smart enough to trust her source material where it counts.
I Still Believe,Still is a nuanced meditation on the price of success.
I Still Believe,"Asked why he wants to continue to tell his story, he says, “I love my mind and I love the places it takes me and I just don’t want that to get cut short.” Anyone who watches this uplifting film will share that feeling."

I Still Believe,"The heart and soul of the film are the face-to-face interviews, which are far less delicate than one might expect. And all the deeper for it."

I Still Believe,"Watching this movie, you remember that funny, needling, nervy little guy up on the screen, and you realize you’re rooting for him. Still."

I Still Believe,What stands out in “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie” is the candor and determination of its subject.

I Still Believe,"By turns heartwarming and heartbreaking, this is a fascinating and funny twin portrait of a Hollywood rise-and-fall, and the realities of living with Parkinson’s."
I Still Believe,"Fox seems every bit a guy we’d all like if we met him, but it seems like hagiography all the same."
I Still Believe,"With apologies to Dr. Emmett Brown, you don’t need a flux capacitor to build a time machine. All you need to do is make a film."
I Still Believe,It’s a revealing documentary about a man who was once one of the busiest actors in Hollywood who has learned in transition to appreciate the loved ones around him even more.
I Still Believe,"As rote as many celebrity navel-gazing documentaries have become, it’s refreshing to see a film that can still find the strengths of the format."

I Still Believe,Admirable and intimate...
The Way Back,Affleck carries the movie both in his muscles and in his subtle shifts of expression.
The Way Back,The Way Back features the rawest and most natural performance Affleck has given in his career.
The Way Back,"The bristly, embittered drunk is a borderline melodramatic cliché, but Affleck imbues it with a lived-in intelligence..."
The Way Back,"Affleck keeps the movie anchored with his rumpled, unshowy performance: a man killing himself to live, until he can start to believe that maybe there's a better way."
The Way Back,An understated portrait of a man battling his demons and trauma that never succumbs to maudlin emotion. It's also a satisfying sports movie offering all the requisite triumphs without overshadowing the more upsetting tale it's telling.
The Way Back,"Affleck does a lot with a tailor-made role, by doing as little as his movie stardom will allow him."
The Way Back,"""The Way Back"" could have been as by the numbers as its title, a name that telegraphs a need to be redeemed, to rebound from adversity. But it isn't."
The Way Back,"To borrow a sports cliché, Ben Affleck gives 110 per cent in The Way Back, an earnest but effective character study that doubles as an inspirational basketball drama."
The Way Back,"For all the film's contrivances, Affleck still draws us into the lost soul at its centre."
The Way Back,"Both Affleck and director Gavin O'Connor, who last worked together on the offbeat thriller The Accountant, aren't just passing the time here, and consistently treat the material with a respect it doesn't always obviously command."
The Way Back,"Fairly conventionally mapped out, but the treatment is handled with deep respect and it's shot beautifully...not completely revelatory but it does follow the classic lines of the genre, and done nicely..."
The Way Back,"The beats are played with conviction. Eventually, Gavin O'Connor's film even rewards Affleck's commitment with a flicker of the unexpected."
The Way Back,O'Connor and Ingelsby seem far too reliant on generic narrative tropes for the film to be anything but yet another predictable sports movie by the numbers.
The Way Back,"Ben Affleck gives his first truly transformative, vanity-free performance as an alcoholic high-school basketball coach in this otherwise familiar underdog sports yarn."
The Way Back,"It cleaves closely to the familiar, but Finding The Way Back scores points by finding different beats within the formula and from a great Ben Affleck performance."
The Way Back,"Plays it too safe, but Affleck goes the extra mile."
The Way Back,I was yearning to find the way out.
The Way Back,The Way Back is a humdrum movie saved from complete tedium by an affecting Affleck performance.
The Way Back,"The Way Back spends most of its run time making the difficult decision, and the final few minutes of the film offer a moment of hope that both satisfies and feels at odds with the grounded storytelling of the first two acts."
The Way Back,"It's a solid effort. There are guts here, just not quite enough glory."
The Way Back,"The movie's parts don't necessarily come together as hoped, but they're still admirable."
The Way Back,The force of Ben Affleck's perpetually anguished glower suggests depths that this redemption-through-sports drama doesn't reach.
The Way Back,"The Way Back wants to be Manchester by the Sea on the hardwood, but it's more like Hoosiers with a hangover."
The Way Back,"Affleck is a superstar who carries darkness and sadness in his shoulders and in his eyes - his Batman was particularly joyless - which makes ""The Way Back"" an ideal role for him."
The Way Back,Surprisingly solid and not at all mawkish or maudlin as it might look from the outset. This is probably the best work of Ben Affleck's career.
The Way Back,"Despite those momentum-stalling and unnecessary detours, the irresistibly cheer-worthy basketball sequences and Affleck's resonant and authentic performance are more than enough to carry the day."
The Way Back,"I will say I like how the director resists the conventional bad times-to-good times story arc. Life does not run in a straight, upward line."
The Way Back,The Way Back emotionally double-dribbles far too often before ultimately clanking the last shot off the front of the iron just as time expires.
The Way Back,"Despite narrative issues, the film is overall affecting and effective with Ben Affleck's powerful performance being a driving force."
The Way Back,"The movie works quite well on its own, understated and willing to embody genre tropes while quietly subverting them. But [Ben] Affleck's history brings the story both emotional heft and a kind of trustworthiness."
The Way Back,"The plot may be formulaic, but there's nothing predictable about Ben Affleck's commitment to the role of Jack, or the subtlety and sincerity with which he plays it."
The Way Back,"The Way Back is a pretty strong sports movie, but it's more of a character study."
The Way Back,I couldn't help but notice the goosebumps covering my arms when the music swelled.
The Way Back,The film makes the path to basketball glory and the road to personal redemption seem oddly effortless.
The Way Back,"Blends the beats of two familiar genres, the underdog sports movie and the addiction and recovery movie, in the process finding a rhythm that feels at once familiar and not quite like anything I've seen before."
The Way Back,aAsolid drama with the additional interest factor of the parallels between the actor and the role.
The Way Back,"Mr. Affleck owns the role. He plays it with the subtlety of a character actor and the coiled ferocity of the star he has always been, through good roles and bad."
The Way Back,"""The Way Back"" course corrects in a big way towards the end, as the movie careens past its expected destination and into a gracefully subdued fourth act that reaffirms the underlying truthfulness of this story."
The Way Back,"""The Way Back"" turns out to be the perfect way back on-screen for Ben Affleck."
The Way Back,"In ""The Way Back,"" you believe the idea of what Jack Gallagher is because you believe the man who plays him, Ben Affleck."
The Way Back,"Clichéd as it is, ""The Way Back"" is not a mawkish picture. Rather, it's notable for the quiet dignity that O'Connor and Affleck bring to the proceedings."
The Way Back,"Aside from Affleck's quietly convincing performance, ""The Way Back"" offers nothing to make it stand out in a crowded field of underdog sports movies."
The Way Back,"Ben Affleck shoots, often scores and most importantly slam dunks a seriously gripping role in his new basketball drama ""The Way Back."""
The Way Back,"Brad Ingelsby's screenplay is the film's guiltiest instrument, shortchanging even the most conventional pleasures of a redemption-themed sports film."
The Way Back,"Though the focus is on Jack's journey back to himself through the device of basketball, the best moments in ""The Way Back"" are the basketball itself... The game is what makes ""The Way Back"" hum, not Jack's tragic backstory."
The Way Back,"Can a film be a compendium of clichés and still feel emotionally honest? ""The Way Back"" is a test case and, aside from the commitment shown by its cast, the answer is, sorry, no."
The Way Back,It's a performance that suggests the most interesting stretch of Affleck's career as an actor is still to come.
The Way Back,"Ben Affleck is still portraying a version of the Tortured Good Guy with a Past, but he exposes his vulnerabilities in ways that audiences have rarely seen."
The Way Back,"Ben Affleck brings his acting A game to this sports/redemption drama that plays way below his level, but still lets us root for the struggling star and the basketball coach he plays to find and honest way back from alcohol addiction."
The Way Back,"O'Connor finds ways to keep viewers subtly off guard; just when you think ""The Way Back"" will turn into a Big Game movie, it reverts to being an addiction drama (and then goes back again)."
The Way Back,"A rich character drama about loss, addiction and self-destruction that only incidentally focuses on the business of life lessons and whipping a ragtag team of misfits into a winning ball club."
The Way Back,"Affleck carries the film well on his larger-than-usual shoulders, capably showing all sides of a down-on-his-luck alcoholic - the funny, the sweet, the explosive and the self-destructive."
The Way Back,"It's neither happily hokey tear-jerking sports movie nor low-to-the-ground, unforgiving indie about an alcoholic. It's stuck in some awkward space between those tropes: not roundly poignant and not unflinching enough."
The Way Back,"The Way Back is a film stuck on the runway, quietly circling around, always threatening to fly but never managing to get off the ground."
The Way Back,[A] modestly well-made Sunday-school lesson.
The Way Back,"It's a reminder that the most trite material-in this case, getting a second chance at making good-can be powerful when handled honestly."
The Way Back,It's meant as a firm compliment to say that The Way Back looks and feels like a film that could have been made at any time between the early 1970s and right now.
The Photograph,"It's a beguiling combination at first, but the surrounding story is too clunky, the revelations too telegraphed."
The Photograph,"Simply put, Michael and Mae don't get enough time to just be, though a sequel could fix that."
The Photograph,"Luxuriantly sensual and unashamedly romantic, The Photograph is a cat's cradle of connecting love stories, spun across states, decades and continents."
The Photograph,It's hard to imagine even the most susceptible audiences caring whether this bland couple get it together.
The Photograph,"What luck, then, that Stella Meghie's film returns to its stronger elements so often."
The Photograph,"Revel... in the subtle back-and-forth of becoming smitten, the glances, touches, silences. Think of it as a dance movie, a good one."
The Photograph,Lakeith Stanfield and Issa Rae do wonderful work as people with an instant connection.
The Photograph,"You don't need to bring a handkerchief into the theatre for fear of ocular leakage, but The Photograph's modestly hopeful denouement is, truly, picture perfect."
The Photograph,"The American black experience has been the definition of pain; however, we do experience joy, fun, and love like every other race. We also experience success, and that is silently the most powerful element of The Photograph."
The Photograph,[Rae and Stanfield] have amazing chemistry.
The Photograph,"It is so good. It is so lovely, and beautifully acted, [and] gorgeously shot."
The Photograph,It's a little too soft and soupy.
The Photograph,"Superbly crafted and acted. Romantic on every level. Never overly dramatic, but always captivating. A refreshing and evocative love story that reflects the times we live in."
The Photograph,"Love, romantic or otherwise, is complicated. The Photograph reminds us that familial love is the root of how we love others."
The Photograph,"For a Valentine's trip to the movies, you couldn't wish for a hotter and more talented pair of lovers than Issa Rae and LaKeith Stanfield. Too bad the movie snuffs out their spark with cliches and over-complicated flashbacks."
The Photograph,"The Photograph is a sincerely beguiling film, even for its faults."
The Photograph,"All of it combines into not only a profoundly romantic experience, but also an exploration of a number of different kinds of love and connection."
The Photograph,"A lovely ghost of a movie, the kind of thing we used to call, in the days before the ascent of the superhero film, a popular entertainment."
The Photograph,"While I appreciate the gorgeous production design of The Photograph, because we don't know anything about these people, their wonderfully moneyed lives are more puzzling than comforting."
The Photograph,"The Photograph is an enjoyable enough love story, and sweet enough to indulge in during a holiday dedicated to candy hearts."
The Photograph,"A dithering, unshakable ambivalence dooms The Photograph, which might be the most distilled example of the deficiencies in Meghie's work as a writer/director."
The Photograph,"Meghie's script is very human, respectful of hesitancy and thoughtful without being flashy."
The Photograph,"Stella Meghie's The Photograph adds to the canon of Black Love on screen and shows that Black sensuality, romance and love stories can be beautifully illustrated without the backdrops of financial hardships or jilting trauma."
The Photograph,The film is at its best when it's focused on the euphoria and tribulations of its central couple.
The Photograph,"A luscious valentine of a movie, the kind of romantic drama audiences keep complaining they don't make any more."
The Photograph,"Most of it is curiously flat and under-seasoned, despite two stars in Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield who have an abundance of chemistry together."
The Photograph,"There's so little genuine, starry eyed you-had-me-at-hello romance in American movies today that when a new love story pops up, it's hard not to root for it."
The Photograph,"""The Photograph"" is a movie of seductive, slow-savored pleasures."
The Photograph,"Watching ""The Photograph"" is like looking through a friend's old photo album - it's not as exciting as your friend thinks it is."
The Photograph,Impressively explores the intricacies of old-school and modern romance in a love story that also highlights the binding ties between a distant mother and her daughter.
The Photograph,"The characters are still likable, even if you've stopped being all that crazy about ""The Photograph."""
The Photograph,"The abundance of talent and some snappy banter add much needed pulse to a film which prioritizes looks over heart, but it can't save a script that's sketch-deep."
The Photograph,"A nostalgic, easygoing romantic-drama...that's roughly the cinematic equivalent of putting on a Quiet Storm classic-soul track when you're lovelorn and feeling that everything is going to be okay after all."
The Photograph,"There's an appreciable poise to The Photograph, which is reflected in the gorgeous lighting by cinematographer Mark Schwartzbard and a moody jazz score from pianist Robert Glasper."
The Photograph,"Stanfield has impressive range, from Get Out to Knives Out, Atlanta to Uncut Gems, but he was also born to play romantic heroes. He could easily be the next Denzel Washington or Brad Pitt."
The Photograph,"If only the story that surrounded it was as strong and well-crafted as the locales and people who populate it, ""The Photograph"" would be more than worthy of affection."
The Photograph,"""The Photograph"" can be a bit off center at times, but once it finds its focus, it's lovely to watch it develop."
The Photograph,"The movie isn't the sort of cookie-cutter sugar wafer that tends to get released by studios on that holiday. It's a looser, warmer, and more meditative romance, one that takes its time by giving its actors room to breathe."
The Photograph,"Despite the film's middle-of-the-road artistic impact, it represents the growth of something unseen for far too long: true-to-life black love that's not just played for laughs."
The Photograph,"""The Photograph"" treats all its characters with some decency and understanding, in a genre where straw villains and cardboard adversaries typically run rampant."
Knives Out,"A terrific, authentic, modern-day Agatha Christie-style whodunnit...with an all-star cast."
Knives Out,"Knives Outis never, ever dull and offers the kind of classy entertainment we could use more of on the big screen. And I have a feeling we'll see more of Daniel Craig's colorful character down the road."
Knives Out,"""Knives Out,"" in the end, believes earnestly in the whodunit, it just wants to turn it inside out. To say more about that would spoil the fun. But keep an eye here, and elsewhere, on de Armas."
Knives Out,"At two hours and 10 minutes the film's on the long side, but it's an entertaining enough pastiche and we haven't had enough of these in the cinema lately. The production design of the cluttered house is fabulous."
Knives Out,"As a smartly crafted and shaped piece of entertainment, Johnson's movie comes off especially good in a moment when such mid-budget, story-driven movies have all but disappeared; it's a throwback that's also an outlier."
Knives Out,The film has a sense of glee that's infectious. It's pleasurable and occasionally silly but it's consistently fun.
Knives Out,"What makes it such a crowd-pleaser is that [Rian] Johnson also expresses a reassuring optimism that human decency will prevail, and that justice will favor the hard-working and good-hearted over the pernicious and self-serving."
Knives Out,"Writer-director Rian Johnson brilliantly keeps the game afoot. Edited with dash and panache, his ingenious plotting keeps you pretty much hooked throughout a playful 130 minutes."
Knives Out,"Knives Out deserves to be explored as a world of it own, as Johnson balances moral conscience and black humor expertly within the constraints of the murder-mystery genre."
Knives Out,[Rian] Johnson throws in every theatrical prop he can think of and ensures that the film is both as amusing as send-ups like Clue or Murder By Death and as robust as any Christie classic.
Knives Out,"Built upon a wittily verbose script that delivers more laugh-out-loud lines than most of the year's alleged comedies, Knives Out retains a beating human heart into which daggers are regularly plunged."
Knives Out,It's pure pleasure.
Knives Out,"Decorating the action with brown wood and rep-theatre costumery, [Johnson] makes no concessions to safety in his vigorous hammering of the accelerator."
Knives Out,"There's a great deal of lively and funny shenanigans with poisons and antidotes, and Johnson delivers a stab of cheerful cynicism."
Knives Out,"An entertainment that's as smart, witty, stylish and exhilarating as any movie lover could wish for."
Knives Out,"A sharp, witty and irresistible twist on the popular whodunnit genre."
Knives Out,"This cracking mystery is a lean-forward experience, as the movie lures you deeper and deeper into its intricately plotted layers. In other words - You. Will. Be. Hooked."
Knives Out,[Rian Johnson's] latest is a satirically malevolent gold mine that refuses to follow the rules of the genre its narrative exists within.
Knives Out,"I suspect that Johnson, an adolescent genre enthusiast to his core, has waited since age 10 to make a movie like this. His enjoyment is contagious, even for those of us who don't think Knives Out quite hits its marks."
Knives Out,"Knives Out is a whole lot of fun, intended to keep the audience off-balance right up until the finish. It's a razor-sharp throwback from writer-director Rian Johnson."
Knives Out,"It's a murder mystery with colorful characters and a central location - but it unfolds into something more complicated and immediately relevant, creating a story that's been dazzlingly updated for a modern audience."
Knives Out,"Johnson's fancy style remains as appealing as ever, though his signature stylistic moves -- the rapid pans, the close-ups from low angles, the tricks with focus -- are by now as recognizable as the line of a cartoonist."
Knives Out,"A viciously droll game of movie Cluedo, the murder mystery dusted off for the modern age."
Knives Out,"In the hands of Craig at his most gleeful, de Armas at her career best, and Johnson oozing love for the genre, Knives Out rises splendidly to the task."
Knives Out,Greed is definitely good when it's this funny.
Knives Out,"What a kick to watch whip-smart director Rian Johnson shake the cobwebs off the whodunit genre and turn it intro terrific, twisted, all-star fun that actually does keep you guessing until the deliciously slippery end."
Knives Out,"In the end, what's most fun about ""Knives Out"" is how fresh it feels."
Knives Out,"The plot whips along at such a pace you can feel the wind in your face, but it is also so tight that you never feel the need to even once glance back."
Knives Out,"It's one of the best movies of the year, and one of the most purely enjoyable, as well."
Knives Out,"A genre savant, Johnson understands that one of the pleasures of mystery stories is how they turn viewers into detectives, eager amateur sleuths who also sift through the clues, false and not."
Knives Out,Offers multiple levels of engagement and enjoyment; it's just that it's always hinting at the superior film it might have been.
Knives Out,Knives Out isn't just a beautifully made diversion. It's also a utopian vision.
Knives Out,"""Knives Out"" is as much a 'toon as it is a hat tip to the elaborate mechanics of an Agatha Christie mystery. It's silly and suspenseful in equal measure."
Knives Out,"[Johnson] brilliantly reinvented crime noir with a high-school bent in his 2006 directorial debut ""Brick,"" and ""Knives Out"" marries the problem-solving of Sherlock and Columbo with the nuttiness of ""Clue."""
Knives Out,"It is deliciously nasty, seasoned with some political jibes, a ton of fun and anything but cozy."
Knives Out,"The class warfare picture by way of Agatha Christie that we never knew we needed, but we do, now more than ever."
Knives Out,"""Knives Out"" shows the sure hand of a serious talent."
Knives Out,"The fun in ""Knives Out"" is watching an ensemble of super-serious actors getting to misbehave."
Knives Out,"Once the game is afoot in ""Knives Out,"" its step is never less than light, swift and sure."

Knives Out,It's exceptional escapist entertainment for those who don't mind a little spice sprinkled into their cozy mystery.
Knives Out,"""Knives Out"" is a kick. By the time it was finally revealed whodunit, I just wanted to start over and play again."
Knives Out,"Though earnest in its full embrace of whodunit tropes and unabashed tonal excesses, the hilarious ensemble piece capitalizes on its many qualities that will garner mass appeal."
Knives Out,This film is just flat out fun.
Knives Out,Sumptuous and diverting...
Knives Out,"Like a clever piece of stage conjuring, ""Knives Out"" is slight but hugely enjoyable."
Knives Out,"""Knives Out"" plays fast and it plays farcical, but it also plays fair. Most of all, it plays like a dream."
Knives Out,"Maybe I'm just jaded, but to me, there isn't a genuine thrill in sight. Still, I found it an enjoyable enough way to pass the time between clichés."
Knives Out,There's not a weak link in this entire cast.
Knives Out,"A frothy whodunit, '70s style, with a cast of today's A-list stars. Great fun."
Knives Out,"Writer-director Rian Johnson's fizzy Agatha Christie riff ""Knives Out"" succeeds as a throwback with more than mere nostalgia on its mind."
Knives Out,"With its narrative double bluffs and knowingly byzantine plot twists, Knives Out nimbly swerves around the pitfalls of murder mysteries past. Full of rhythmic verve and pithy humor, this is uproariously entertaining filmmaking."
Knives Out,"There's no one on earth, or even in the movies, who talks quite the way the people in Knives Out do, but we become conversant in their idiosyncratic patois by listening to it and learning the rules of this stylized fictional world."
Knives Out,"What's that I hear? It's 'as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.' The sound of deflated haters never sounded so sweet as seeing Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi followup, the wildly hilarious whodunit Knives Out."
Knives Out,"It's an ingeniously constructed film, which is thoroughly modern in its language and filled with so many twists it will make your head spin."
Knives Out,"Johnson, on temporary sabbatical from the Star Wars universe after The Last Jedi, has used his time well. Murder he wrote - and what a writer he is."
Knives Out,"There is some savvy subtext in Rian Johnson's writing, about old money and Trump-era values, but mainly this is exceptional cinematic froth, and murder at its most mirthful."
Knives Out,"Every time you think you've guessed what's up the writer-director's sleeve, you both have and haven't: the layering, feints, and decoys fox you exactly as he's hoping."
Knives Out,"There are plot twists aplenty, but none add up to much."
Knives Out,"Knives Out is one of a kind. Rian Johnson doesn't hold back delivering big fun and spicy commentary with fiery results. And if you don't already know that Ana de Armas is something special, there's no excuses after this."
Knives Out,...the idea of the film really is have a blast in giving us an old-fashioned murder mystery solved in the most old-fashioned way - through the use of the old grey cells. Poirot would approve.
Knives Out,"It's a worthy tribute to Agatha Christie, a light but pointed rebuke, and a delectable time at the movies, too."
Knives Out,"It lacks Hitchcockian tension or Christie-level dignity, but it's funny, surprising, and intriguing in the way it flips the usual murder-mystery script."
Knives Out,"Best to remember that those old movies Johnson embraces were really not that great, and to bring lowered expectations to his entertaining but scattershot update."
Knives Out,"A whodunit awash in twists, turns and rampant cleverness, ""Knives Out"" is, above all, a celebration of murder mysteries that puts on a fairly nifty impression of one itself."
Knives Out,Knives Out Is The Best Whodunnit Of The Decade
Knives Out,"A silly, stabby, supremely clever whodunnit that only really suffers from having too little room for each of its talented players to fully register in the film's limited run time."
Knives Out,"Johnson hasn't just churned out a wink-wink spoof of the classical drawing-room mystery... with its ingenious twists and turns, he has crafted an intricate puzzle-box narrative worthy of the genre's brainiest practitioners."
Knives Out,"Knives Out is a classic whodunit, and doesn't mind who knows it."
Knives Out,"This is a dizzy, zippy and surprisingly politically astute murder-mystery comedy that hits all its beats with flair, before turning around and knifing conventional thinking in the back."
Knives Out,"Something new, surprising and extremely entertaining."
Knives Out,"A crackling, devious, and hugely satisfying old-school whodunnit with a modern twist..."
Knives Out,"The film rolls and bounces with giddy elation, Johnson and his troupe of actors clearly enjoying themselves as they entertain."
Knives Out,"Do not expect subtlety; it's the kind of movie that tells you the ""game's afoot"" twice."
Knives Out,"This, in other words, is one of those mysteries so clever and fiendishly well-engineered that you eventually have no choice but to stop trying to get ahead of it, to simply enjoy the way it plants and payoffs."
Knives Out,"Directing a wildly charismatic cast who are all-in on what he's doing, Johnson confidently stays a step or two ahead of his audience, leaving them breathless but satisfied at the end."
Knives Out,The actors' hammy performances only compound the amusement of watching a dynasty propped up by largesse fall to pieces at the very thought of actually having to earn their way in life.
Knives Out,"There's so much to love about Rian Johnson's triumph, both as gratuitously enjoyable entertainment and the first film to take on the significance of a President Trump without lapsing into corny preachiness."
Knives Out,"Johnson keeps us guessing, which is good, but the thing that makes this a better mousetrap than most isn't the complexity, but the fact he's managed to rig it without the usual cheese."
Knives Out,"A delicious throwback to the all-star whodunit, this juicy comedy thriller is a treat from start to finish, which should make it a sizeable hit for Lionsgate."
Knives Out,"Working from his own original script, Johnson has much fun pulling the strings as well as the rug from underneath us time and time again."
Hidden Blade,"The bluntness keeps the film from approaching greatness, although history buffs and genre fans might appreciate a World War II story told from a unique, non-Western perspective."
Hidden Blade,"As much as Tony Leung was made for subtle but heady roles like this, Hidden Blade belongs to Wang Yibo, and so does this review."
Hidden Blade,Gorgeous and empty.
Hidden Blade,"""Hidden Blade,"" a stylish, nonlinear exercise in Chinese film noir, is one of those movies where, at first, you're not exactly sure where it's going or what anyone's doing. But, boy, do they look great doing it."
Hidden Blade,"However crisp and stylishly executed, the parts don’t quite add up to a satisfying whole."
Hidden Blade,"While it is eminently watchable, it’s a movie that consists of mostly people sitting at tables with fantastic period clothing plotting and scheming, but sometimes barely moving at all."
Just Mercy,"Foxx does his best work in a decade. For the charismatic Jordan, who puts in a tone-setting nuanced turn here, Just Mercy arrives between Creed II and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse. Let's hope he sticks with the ""one for them, one for me"" formula."
Just Mercy,"""Just Mercy"" is solid, meat-and-potatoes docudrama filmmaking, if you don't mind a first-rate story of systemic injustice undercut by second-rate dialogue."
Just Mercy,"Unlike many movies ""based on a true story,"" ""Just Mercy"" sticks close to the facts of the case - for the simple reason that the facts are drama enough."
Just Mercy,It's both rage-inducing and awe-inspiring; the courage conveyed by the protagonists is a balm on the sting of injustice.
Just Mercy,"It's competently made... Thought has been put into this production, and again, I'm completely a hundred percent on the side of everything it has to say. I just don't think it's a very good movie."
Just Mercy,"Just Mercy is a deeply moving film, a human story about injustice and justice and how intangible and ephemeral they both really are."
Just Mercy,"an earnest and important film about the still-festering sore of race in today's America - though when pitted against inveterate, sneering prejudice, its protagonist's one-note saintliness, however real, does not make for the most compelling drama"
Just Mercy,"It's steady and clear-headed, safe in the knowledge that truth is the ultimate humaniser."
Just Mercy,"Just Mercy isn't interested in giving it a showy new spin. Instead the extraordinary, hope-inspiring true story is allowed to speak for itself, powered along by committed turns by Jordan and Brie Larson."
Just Mercy,"It's good acting at its finest in this preaching to the choir ""right to life"" drama that might have worked had the filmmakers chosen to show the audience a little mercy by not constantly talking down to them."
Just Mercy,"Jordan, however, is completely persuasive. The virtues possessed by Stevenson are all on the quiet side. His analytical flair is matched by his patience, his tenacity and his acuity."
Just Mercy,"Still, by the time you reach the end - and realise how closely the film-makers have stuck to the facts - you won't care. That the truth will out is entertainment enough."
Just Mercy,Just Mercy isn't stylistically dazzling. The chronicle of racism is also familiar. But Cretton and his leads give the narrative an urgency and timeliness.
Just Mercy,"In parts stolid, but solid nevertheless, Just Mercy is timely and important."
Just Mercy,This is a powerful drama about an important ongoing issue.
Just Mercy,"The film has this kind of slow burn quality, it has a very good ensemble cast."
Just Mercy,[I]t's never less than engrossing. Even with the schmaltz.
Just Mercy,"Jordan... has steel and energy in his part, and... Foxx... gives a beautifully modulated, unflashy and quietly moving performance, easily his best in at least a decade."
Just Mercy,"The markers of the story are so familiar (venal law enforcement, leaned-on witnesses, the courtroom), it takes nerve to tell it this simply."
Just Mercy,"The film's power lies in the brutality of its true story, and yet that narrative stays within fairly conventional bounds precisely because of Cretton's commitment to telling it."
Just Mercy,"Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, ""Just Mercy"" follows a predictable path that is nonetheless rousing due to the strength of its real-life elements."
Just Mercy,"We never gain much of a sense for who Stevenson is or what motivates him beyond the pursuit of legal justice, and Cretton makes no attempt to deviate from a familiar prestige drama template."
Just Mercy,"An ultimately heart-warming watch that argues passionately for justice, community and kindness."
Just Mercy,"That message is revolutionary and makes Just Mercy more than ""just"" a movie; it's a movement, a way of being, a radical call to action. It's on all of us to answer the call."
Just Mercy,"An important story of injustice inspires but fails to fully ignite, despite two towering central performances from Jamie Foxx and Michael B. Jordan."
Just Mercy,"...a sobering reminder of a deeply flawed, socially unbalanced legal system that to this day often turns its back on persons of color who can't afford the legal defense they truly deserve."
Just Mercy,It could have been melodramatic and over the top. What I really admire about the tone that Destin Daniel Cretton sets throughout is that... it's understated so that truth always rings through.
Just Mercy,"With the exception of Foxx's moving performances, ""Just Mercy"" delivers little you can't get from simply watching the news."
Just Mercy,"After his electrifying appearance in ""Black Panther,"" here Jordan is a lawyer whose only superpowers are his integrity and his constant courtesy."
Just Mercy,"Cretton's filmmaking technique is straightforward, but his lack of frills allows the viewer to soak in the emotions of every situation."
Just Mercy,It's a tough-minded and hopeful movie because it is unusually interested in making us see difficult truths and care about people we might prefer to forget about.
Just Mercy,A compelling legal drama with fine performances from Jordan and Foxx.
Just Mercy,Rarely if ever has the death penalty-and the damage its inequitable application inflicts on everyone from prison employees to family members of the accused-been given such a thorough and gripping rendering as it is here.
Just Mercy,"Despite its flaws, ""Just Mercy"" is that rarity - a movie that inspires; a story that brings light."
Just Mercy,"""Just Mercy"" isn't the best movie that could have been made from its subject, but it's good enough."
Just Mercy,"Even if often predictable, Cretton's engaging drama overcomes its shortcomings with watchable empathy and grace."
Just Mercy,"From its smooth visuals and warm, swinging sounds to its magnificent performances, ""Just Mercy"" is masterfully constructed to keep us inside a story that otherwise would be too brutal to bear."
Just Mercy,"This devastatingly affecting drama, based on a true story, reveals outrageous abuses in the justice system-ones that have hardly been redressed."
Just Mercy,"With all this weighted context, the fact that Just Mercy works is a pleasant surprise."
Just Mercy,This is not a story that one has not seen before -- yet it is a story that is so deeply true and so moving.
Just Mercy,"Thanks to Destin Daniel Cretton's effective direction and this ensemble's sensitive performances, Just Mercy quite nearly shakes the formulaic nature of this genre."
Just Mercy,"""Just Mercy"" has the feel of an old-fashioned studio throwback -- one where the underlying story is more compelling than the film."
Just Mercy,The real battle is still to be won. That's the power of Just Mercy. It demands that you bear witness.
Just Mercy,Cretton keeps things emotionally grounded while also crafting an authentically hardscrabble milieu that is bracingly sincere.
Just Mercy,"I don't know what liberties Cretton and his co-writer Andrew Lanham have taken, but their treatment feels honest and sober, a precise and patient accounting rather than a righteous protest."
Just Mercy,"Despite the whiff of ""Oscar bait"" surrounding the production, it's a well-made, affecting tale about do-gooders who do good rather than merely muddying the waters."
Just Mercy,"""Just Mercy"" is saved from being an earnest, inert courtroom drama when it spends time on death row, where it is opened up and given depth by two strong, subtle performances, from Foxx and Rob Morgan."
Just Mercy,"The majority of films about African-American suffering have always been calibrated the way Just Mercy is, with an eye to not offending White viewers with anything remotely resembling Black anger."
Just Mercy,"The film is never subtle or nuanced, which plays into what viewers want from social justice dramas.... ""Just Mercy"" is Oscar bait that showcases Stevenson and his important work."
Just Mercy,"What continually floats the film is the commitment of its excellent cast, and the intrinsic truth at its core: that justice shouldn't be divided by black and white, even if the message that delivers it sometimes is."
Just Mercy,"It's a story that's been told time and again, yes, but one that keeps needing to be told - and when a film such as this is capable of inspiring passionate anger about injustice, that's worthwhile in itself."
Just Mercy,"The film portrays the ferocious resistance of some people to the possibility that this man had nothing to do with the crime. And that's when ""Just Mercy"" is at its best."
Just Mercy,The naturalism of the cinematography and acting sometimes clashes with dialogue that seems overly polished.
Just Mercy,"I was never emotionally moved, but I was enjoying watching a man take down the system with incredible principles."
Just Mercy,"The pacing is good, the atmosphere authentic, and even the paperwork -- which is where the real revolutions in law occur -- has a certain kinetic quality to it."
Just Mercy,"Just Mercy tugs on the heartstrings, but never in a way that's manipulative. Jordan and Foxx command your attention."
Just Mercy,The filmmakers and actors imbue the characters with remarkable depth of feeling.
Just Mercy,Michael B. Jordan is terrific.
Just Mercy,"The clear-cut morality of the plot necessitates dramatic tension or righteous fury, and Cretton delivers neither."
Just Mercy,"There's no doubt that Just Mercy's heart is in the right place, and it's made skillfully enough to push all the right buttons... As a work of cinema, though, Just Mercy is a curiously restrained piece."
Just Mercy,[Jamies] Foxx gives his best performance since Ray.
Just Mercy,"Just Mercy is a no-frills film that's not meant to entertain, but act as a wake-up call, and a call to action."
Just Mercy,"It's a new twist on the old formula of Yankee lawyers who come to the South and find a wall of community resistance to racial equality and injustice, but it's a powerful one."
Just Mercy,"The kind of film that poses the question, ""Is it OK to be preachy if you're doing it for a very good cause?"""
Just Mercy,"As a heroic lawyer, Jordan (who also served as producer) is more refined and dignified than all the movie lawyers (and perhaps real-life lawyers) before him."
Just Mercy,"Strong performances, especially by Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Foxx and Tim Blake Nelson, help make the message a movie."
Just Mercy,"Yet Jordan and Foxx take the little material they're given and play it as deep as possible, turning in memorable, eventually gut-punching performances."
Just Mercy,"In spite of its shortcomings, Just Mercy is still the sort of film that's worth watching and absorbing and discussing, because the story it tells has not stopped being relevant in the decades since [Bryan] Stevenson and [Walter] McMillian met."
Just Mercy,Just Mercy pays noble credit to a specifically remarkable man.
Just Mercy,"As a celebration of what it takes to eke out justice in a broken system, it's a welcome return to formula."
Just Mercy,There's too little anger and dirt and fear in this story.
Just Mercy,"Profoundly moving and, at times, almost unbearably sad..."
Just Mercy,"The film around Michael B. Jordan plays like a lesson on justice being taught by self-aware actors, but he lives Bryan's pain, imbuing Just Mercy with a forcefulness that overpowers the its sermonizing."
Just Mercy,"""Just Mercy"" is a handsome, impeccably mounted tribute to his activism and also his fellow advocates."
Just Mercy,"Just Mercy is a straightforward, no-frills drama that does have an undeniably emotive effect."
Just Mercy,"Although conventional in its approach, the film is a forceful reckoning of a broken legal system."
Just Mercy,"""Just Mercy"" is clearly a film with its heart squarely in the right place. But the broad strokes are just too familiar here, and try as he might, Cretton simply can't put a fresh spin on them."
Just Mercy,"There were moments you wish it was shorter. Yet if the chain of courtroom battles at the end spin around facts we already know, what's unpredictable is the human factor."
Just Mercy,"A sturdy example of this genre, in which persistence and faith lead to the righting of terrible wrongs, it will likely move younger viewers who haven't seen many like it."
Little Women,A gorgeous and very warm film…. What makes this version impressive is that it brings a different perspective without losing the magic of the novel.
Little Women,Greta Gerwig's experimental take adds clarity and wisdom to character developments and relationships that make the viewing experience more rewarding.
Little Women,No wonder Jo and Amy in all their ambiguities are the ones who leave the strongest impression and offer Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh respectively the opportunity to invest in and dig into their characters with relish.
Little Women,"Moments like these are reminders of the urgency of the text, and of how rewarding it can be for a contemporary audience to re-examine the classic stories we read in our childhood."
Little Women,"This is a really thoughtful adaptation, incredibly smart and incredibly moving."
Little Women,"Gerwig takes matters in a new direction, at once more playful and more sober, and very self-conscious."
Little Women,"Normally I'm not averse to time-shifting in movies, but in this case I found the device unhelpful. Individual scenes are superbly staged and the cast is flawless, making the film essential viewing for lovers of the book."
Little Women,"A work of poetic smuggling: a movie made within the norms of the industry that also reflects Gerwig's own personal artistic ideas, ideals, and obsessions."
Little Women,"Greta Gerwig's take on Louisa May Alcott's novel is intelligent and fleet, refreshing if not radical, and as organic in its feminist convictions as it is in its depiction of close-knit sororal love."
Little Women,Do not miss this - it's wonderful.
Little Women,"About 20 minutes in, the characters cease to be characters; they are now flesh and blood, our sisters. We feel their happiness and despond, their cold feet and warm hearts, their slights and loves. It's a masterful, passionate, all-in kind of adaptation."
Little Women,Greta Gerwig has an intrinsic understanding of Louisa May Alcott's story and she's retold it with great compassion.
Little Women,"It made me laugh, cry, and feel like I was absolutely a part of the story and the characters. Gerwig has done something really fascinating. I loved it."
Little Women,The latest adaptation gives the March sisters more power than ever.
Little Women,One-hundred-and-fifty-year-old literature never felt so alive.
Little Women,I love that Greta [Gerwig] takes not only ideas from the book... She's closing the gap between Jo [March] and Louisa May Alcott and showing us that these women were the same.
Little Women,An absolutely lovely film that will make you feel so extremely good walking out of it.
Little Women,It's Little Women's deep generosity that cements it as a cinematic achievement.
Little Women,"The swings in time, admittedly, can be a tad disorienting at first, but they provide a narrative spine that brings additional resonance to a story that most people likely think they already know."
Little Women,"It acknowledges the tradeoffs we still have to reckon with, but it celebrates them. And it brilliantly, movingly puts forth the simple, timeless notion that sisterhood is always powerful."
Little Women,"[Saoirse Ronan] is the linchpin of the drama and gives the performance of the movie. Ronan, who has already snagged a Golden Globe nomination for the film and is a dead cert for an Oscar nod, is on impossibly sharp form here."
Little Women,The parts of Gerwig's film I appreciated most were those of its candidness about the economic choices a woman makes.
Little Women,A true Christmas gift: a rich and rewarding slice of Americana that defies the odds of doomsayers who believe that major-studio movies are on their way out.
Little Women,"Gerwig manages to honor both the letter and the spirit of Alcott's tale; Little Women is stuffed with trials and tribulations, yet overflowing with goodwill."
Little Women,"Lovable, kind and funny, ""Little Women"" is a movie you want to hug."
Little Women,"Though we can't foretell whether time will be cruel or kind to Gerwig's ""Little Women,"" it may just be the best film yet made by an American woman."
Little Women,"If Gerwig was concerned about making her mark on the 150-year-old story, she needn't be, as her comedic voice is polished and distinctly her own."
Little Women,That Gerwig in only her second feature film manages to meet the likes of Alcott partway is a blooming miracle.
Little Women,"Watching Greta Gerwig's 2019 ""Little Women"" is like visiting an old friend for tea. The conversation may not surprise, but that's what makes the company a warm comfort."
Little Women,"Because of the strength of the acting (Ronan's in particular) and Gerwig's unusual (love it or hate it) reworking of the novel's chronology and ending, it deserves to be seen."
Little Women,A blissful and innovative screen adaptation that feels ageless and vastly of today.
Little Women,"Gerwig not only loves and understands the book, she knows we are only beginning to catch up to Alcott's vision of what is possible for young women and for all of us."
Little Women,"The writer-director's funny, moving adaptation respects the popular novel but gives these 1860s women attitudes that seem current."
Little Women,"Gerwig casts the tale in a new and modern light, illuminating the struggles the little women face in learning about the world and how they have to fit themselves into it... and how revolutionary it is for a girl to write herself into her own story."
Little Women,"This ""Little Women"" purist was moved to tears by this movie, and didn't want it to end."
Little Women,"Ms. Gerwig's reimagining-and provocative restructuring-of the American classic is all ablaze with ferocious purpose, urgent passion, boisterous humor and the nourishing essence of family life in good times and bad."
Little Women,"For Alcott stalwarts, the new ""Little Women"" brings almost an excess of fresh energy and charm. But an excess of charm is a good fault."
Little Women,Ronan is flawless.
Little Women,"Without resorting to self-conscious anachronism or fussy antiquarianism, Gerwig has fashioned a story that feels at once entirely true to its 19th-century origins and utterly modern."
Little Women,"Gerwig has reimagined the novel back to its roots, as the story of not just one woman but all the women Louisa May Alcott may have lived with or known or been. It is an offering - to her, to them, and to us."
Little Women,"It's a legacy not just of a great story and vividly drawn characters, but also of information: Alcott told us that it takes work and openness to know who you are, and when you figure it out, hang on for dear life."
Little Women,Gerwig's take on the Alcott classic may shock people who really know the story and who expect a more leisurely pace. But it could also invigorate them with its bold approach.
Little Women,"Flaws aside, this festive film feels like an event. Gerwig's characters aren't just for Christmas. We'll love them, I suspect, for the rest of our lives."
Little Women,"The sly smuggling of feminist subtexts - already a small part of Alcott's contraband design - gives the film a sardonic, vibrant modernism."
Little Women,Guys should stop treating 'Little Women' like Kryptonite. Greta Gerwig reimagines Louisa May Alcott's classic novel for a new generation and creates a movie for the ages without clipping the wings of her own soaring wit and imagination.
Little Women,Gerwig takes big risks when she departs from Alcott's novel but stays true to its spirit. Her movie gave me all the feels.
Little Women,"This is a gorgeously acted, expertly crafted and utterly mesmerising adaptation of Little Women which will live on in the memory of every young girl experiencing this story for the first time."
Little Women,"I think Greta Gerwig has tapped into what she loved about Little Women as a kid, but made it feel really relevant. This movie tries really hard to say ""Little Women matters today,"" and I think it succeeds."
Little Women,"It's a perfectly respectable version of a tale told too many times, but it offers nothing fresh or new to the re-telling."
Little Women,"Gerwig has delivered an ambitious, energetic and sweeping Little Women for our time."
Little Women,Greta Gerwig has reshaped Alcott's novel with a touch that feels both faithful and radical.
Little Women,"Despite a misguided conception and a cast directed to act like disgruntled graduate students at Vassar, there's much here that's indestructible."
Little Women,Louisa May Alcott's classic novel gets a subtle update in this sharp and engaging film.
Little Women,Gerwig's approach to time... makes the culmination of the story Jo's awakening as a writer - finding her voice.
Little Women,Gerwig understands the indignity of being born a girl just as well as her author did.
Little Women,"I liked this one's sense of play, and also how generous [Greta] Gerwig is with her spotlight."
Little Women,This is an adaptation that is as satisfying as it is intelligent. New generation? Old generation? Who cares?
Little Women,"Yes, this wildly romantic weepie provides comfort viewing but it's also a story that challenges us to step up and outwards, to live better, to be 'good, happy and useful'."
Little Women,Little Women is the cinematic equivalent of a warm hug or a mug of hot chocolate. It's a beautiful tale of family and love you'll wrap yourself up in.
Little Women,"While no shortage of ""Little Women"" adaptations exist, Gerwig makes hers modern and sharp, while still adhering to its traditional roots."
Little Women,"It would be hard to find a ""Little Women"" more suited to its times, for love or money."
Little Women,"Without sacrificing any of the story's period charm or authenticity, [Gerwig] adds a contemporary feel that can appeal to the book's devoted fans and its sceptics alike."
Little Women,Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Yorick Le Saux - Little Women is stunning and robust.
Little Women,"In her zesty adaptation, Greta Gerwig develops ingeniously the theme of women finding their voices."
Little Women,"Everyone in the film is great, especially Saoirse Ronan."
Little Women,"Fresh, sparkling, natural and full of soul."
Little Women,"[T]his is a film in love with its characters' passions, a rich and effortlessly vibrant examination of the four March ""little women"" and the ways... they're practically bursting with the innocent it's-happening-right-now joy of being young and alive."
Little Women,One of the most brilliantly staged adaptations of any literary work... It somehow acts as both a reappraisal and slight reinvention of Alcott's work while remaining a gorgeous tribute to it.
Little Women,"In an era in which sentimentality is a seasoning that filmmakers either shun entirely or employ with too heavy a hand, Gerwig crafts a work that is moving without being manipulative. This is a Little Women for the ages."
Little Women,"It doesn't just brim with life, it brims with ideas about happiness, economic realities, and what it means to push against or to hew to the expectations laid out for one's gender."
Little Women,"If this isn't the Little Women you remember, either on page or screen, that's understandable. But it's likely the one you felt, and that's more important."
Little Women,"It's a warm fireplace hearth of a film, albeit one with a tendency to spit out fiery embers."
Little Women,"Greta Gerwig's Little Women is ambitious and enchanting, refreshingly rendering a classic tale in non-linear fashion for a new generation of young girls everywhere."
Little Women,"Apart from a single scene which feels like a belated, unnecessary recognition of the lack of racial diversity in the cast, the film doesn't strike a single false note."
Little Women,"Whenever Little Women slows down, viewers receive a glimpse of how the film might have flowed as a whole."
Little Women,"A tremendously resonant, sometimes heartbreaking and always entertaining hoot."
Little Women,"An often cloyingly self-satisfied, over-stuffed riposte to the endless Jane Austen adaptations from across the pond, Little Women is American heritage cinema at its most lavishly nostalgic."
Little Women,The film works because Gerwig manages to re-emphasise some new aspect of the profound connection between these characters in every new scene.
Little Women,"Gerwig has taken a treasured perennial of popular American literature and reshaped it for a new generation, which should give the captivating film a long shelf life."
Little Women,"Gerwig and her girls know the hearts and minds of the sisters through and through. ""Little Women"" is about them above all else."
Little Women,"As one might hope, Gerwig's interpretation does right by the material, sticking to the original period and setting and assembling a dream cast to play the March siblings."
Little Women,"There's nothing little about Greta Gerwig's rich, warm, bustlingly populated and passionately devoted new tribute to Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of sisterhood."
Little Women,"The film tweaks the structure of a well-known and beloved story and modernizes it with light meta touches, all while staying true to its old-fashioned belief in the virtues of kindness and selflessness."
Little Women,"If Gerwig's woke Women-hood verges on anachronism, though, it also feels fully loyal to the spirit of Alcott, a woman always well ahead of her time."
Little Women,"The hard work Gerwig has put in strikes deepening chords with the material as it goes. In tune with the March sisterhood, her film gradually figures out what it yearns to be."
Little Women,"If there were any remaining doubts that Greta Gerwig is a major talent in American cinema, put them to rest now."
Little Women,"It's often a lovely experience, to sit with Gerwig's ardor, to feel the warming beam of her cast radiating off the screen. I left the theater with eyes brimming. I only wish that the film's spell was cast a bit less briskly..."
Showing Up,"There’s no punching down in Showing Up and not much navel-gazing either: just a master of her craft contemplating the myriad difficulties endemic to creating anything, and then making it look effortless."
Showing Up,"[Reichardt and Williams's] shorthand creates its own universe, and it's as insular as the world they're depicting. Outsiders will likely feel like they're showing up without an invite."
Showing Up,The comedy is often as dry as an untouched paintbrush.
Showing Up,"Like Lizzy’s sculptures, there’s a wounded tactility at work here—in miniature, even. What you get out of it will depend on your patience for such thoughtful if prickly work."
Showing Up,"The film is a testament to my favorite kind of character, the ones who go about their lives in a one-foot-in-front-of-the-other manner."
Showing Up,Soulful and moving.
Showing Up,"It is a serene, pulse-lowering charmer."
Showing Up,"Reichardt likes to watch, and the new movie is at its most serene when it parks the camera next to a student working on a painting or a pot or an installation or a dance and just lets the footage run."
Showing Up,"Showing Up’s unassuming canvas carries the weight of creation -- its difficulty and necessity in atomized times -- and though it never preaches, Reichardt maintains there’s worth to the work, even if the precarity never disappears."
Showing Up,"This is the cinematic equivalent of a great still life of a bowl of fruit: The technique is undeniable, but it's just a bowl of fruit."
Showing Up,"What initially seems to be a slice-of-life drama eventually reveals itself as a paean to the difficulties, and rewards, of making art."
Showing Up,Reichardt reflects an abiding respect for artists and their freedom to explore and process while Williams inhabits the soul of a creative being in every frame and every second.
Showing Up,"Kelly Reichardt... turns her thoughtful attention to the act of creation itself, rendering both its transcendence and mundanity with equal curiosity."
Showing Up,"Audiences need to meet it halfway, with their eyes, minds and emotions open. Those that do will have a fulfilling and memorable experience."
Showing Up,"Once you get into the mood that it'll never explode into anything revelatory, it's genial enough."
Showing Up,Brilliantly nuanced and meticulously observed.
Showing Up,"That this moody, woozy character study falls closer to the “masterpiece” side of the fence isn’t a surprise, considering it comes from Kelly Reichardt and Michelle Williams, one of the best filmmaker-actor duos of the last quarter century."
Showing Up,"The on-the-surface modesty of Showing Up is a kind of sorcery. It’s in the days afterward, when you’ve left its spell and gone back to the world, that its essence is more likely to take shape..."
Showing Up,"There's something a little too neat about the structure of ""Showing Up"" ... but the piercing specificity of Reichardt's vision, and her insights into the dynamics of an art scene like the one in Portland, are spot on."
Showing Up,"Appropriate for its visual art milieu, Showing Up entreats us to carefully observe."
Showing Up,"Brusque without being flippant, tender without syrupy tones, the director's latest film could easily be mistaken as a minor work in an already distinguished career if the intentional care weren't so apparent."
Showing Up,"It’s about who will turn out to be firmly on Lizzy’s side when all is said and done... The answer surprises her as well as us, and it brings this wincingly funny, stealthily emotional movie to a conclusion that feels both casual and momentous."
Showing Up,“Showing Up” is a portrait of an individual but the film is universal in the sense that it’s about a woman living in the concrete here and now.
Showing Up,"Director Kelly Reichardt, who also penned the film with her regular screenwriter, Jonathan Raymond, has created a tiresome bubble inside a bubble, focusing their lens to pointless effect on a group of low-level artists in Portland, Oregon."
Showing Up,"Reichardt, who wrote the script with Jon Raymond, invests the film’s meticulously observed action with a quiet yet passionate grandeur."
Showing Up,The art is both the focus of Kelly Reichardt’s personal new film but also adjacent to the larger exigencies of life.
Showing Up,"Showing Up --an unusually cheerful and funny film for Reichardt --is, in its essence, a chronicle of a Sisyphean quest rendered against the backdrop of laid-back Portland."
Showing Up,Showing Up is a rare film about the art world that presents a scene of artists who won’t be getting rich off their work.
Showing Up,"Like the distinctive artwork made by Showing Up's sculptor protagonist, Kelly Reichardt's eighth feature is beautifully crafted, a modest gem that grows in impact the more one examines it."
Showing Up,"It will infuriate many. But it has power, and it lingers."
Showing Up,"Showing Up feels like a moment of release for the filmmaker, a knowing reflection on past work and artistic growth while leaning in to all the beautiful elements of sound, colour and texture that have come to be expected from her work."
Showing Up,"Reichardt’s cinema is characterised by a specific running interest in the ways we care for each other, both out of love and obligation, and the transactions we make to feel supported in life."
Showing Up,"As with Lizzy’s sculptures, which go into the kiln all mottled and damp but come out glistening with new layers of color, Showing Up is transformed by its finishing touches. The pieces that emerge are warm and alive."
Showing Up,"While Reichardt does certainly poke some light fun at a version of her own milieu, there is also a deep, if gently stated, affection for these spaces and all they allow."
Showing Up,"From Certain Women to First Cow, Reichardt has delivered deep and powerful storytelling. Seeing her commit more fully to her lighter side is both refreshing and slightly frustrating by comparison."
Showing Up,Overflowing with gentle humor and heart.
Showing Up,"A lot of this one’s enjoyment value comes from its dry patience, its willingness to sit tight and fully scrutinise a corner of the world."
Showing Up,"“Showing Up” is perhaps Reichardt’s most grounded and least impressionistic film, but it is still more than thoughtful and enjoyable and beautiful."
Showing Up,"“Showing Up” may be too quiet to find a large audience, but in its lovely way it locates that place where art and life intersect, as each becomes the other."
Showing Up,"It is sometimes a bit studied and passionless, especially compared with Reichardt’s previous film, First Cow. But there is sympathy and charm and food for thought."

How to Blow Up a Pipeline,"An ensemble drama too diluted to meaningfully establish any characters, How to Blow Up a Pipeline relies on tension-building music and chaotic flashbacks to piece together its one-trick heist narrative."
How to Blow Up a Pipeline,"Pipeline’s captivating ensemble of up-and-comers is equal to the film’s imperativeness, and some of the character relationships feel as expendable as the explosive-carrying barrels central to the movie’s plot."

How to Blow Up a Pipeline,"Each member of this ratpack clan represents a distinct background ensures that what unites them is not allegiance to a singular political or spiritual ideology, but rather the notion of a shared enemy: those willing to see the planet burn for a profit."
How to Blow Up a Pipeline,"The way that filmmaker Daniel Goldhaber pulls off what feels like a tightly wound Hollywood potboiler on what we imagine is little more than a studio caterer’s budget is, in itself, a textbook how-to example."
How to Blow Up a Pipeline,"There's no single figure with whom to empathize, but rather a concentration on the issues, the justifiable rage about inevitable environmental collapse, and the nerve-racking tension of waiting to see what – or who – will explode."

First Signal,Lund has created an interesting no-budget film in First Signal.
Jockey,Jockey finishes a first-place winner without even needing to run an actual race.
Jockey,Jockey sweats authenticity from every dust-impacted pore.
Jockey,"It sounds cheesy, but the novice writer-director Clint Bentley, whose father was a jockey, brings a radical realism to the tale."
Jockey,"What elevates it most is Collins, a familiar supporting actor with an air of Johnny Cash whose nuanced, soulful work as star makes the whole film ring true."
Jockey,"Collins is quietly mesmerizing, his mannerisms so small that they hardly register. But the work is there, as it has always been. You know his face, and now with ""Jockey,"" you'll know Clifton Collins' name, too."
Jockey,"It's a movie that gets by (and then some) on an intense and focused performance by character actor Clifton Collins Jr, and a truthful-feeling sense of place."
Jockey,"If Oscar voters remembered Clifton Collins Jr.'s work in ""Jockey"" - or even saw it - he'd be winning best actor this year."
Jockey,"A gorgeous film, but in a bizarrely empty way."
Jockey,"While there are a few plotting slip-ups here and there, Collins' electrifying performance carries this over the finish line."
Jockey,"Filmmaker Clint Bentley makes a tender, visually poetic feature directorial debut with ""Jockey,"" a closely observed portrait of a man embarking on the downslope of his career."
Jockey,"Collins dominates the film, often in close-up, in a rich performance, and is ably assisted by Molly Parker, as the trainer, Ruth; and Moises Arias as his possible son, Gabriel."
Jockey,"Everything feels real in the drama starring Clifton Collins Jr., just right as a veteran rider taking a risk by getting back in the saddle."
Jockey,"Collins is so wonderfully genuine, so believable as someone who has seen a lot of stories like this play out and has a pretty good idea how this one ends, but wants to hang onto the reins for as long as he can anyway."
Jockey,"We get one of these kinds of films every year... It does all depend on how much you care about the performances, and Collins Jr. really is good."
Jockey,"An evocative, haunting, and pretty intimate character study."
Jockey,Jockey works because it has an expert rider who knows when to hold back and when to push something from a fast gallop to a sprint.
Jockey,The film also rates high on the pleasure scale for being a debut feature by abundantly gifted filmmakers and a showcase for a performance that fills your heart while frequently threatening to break it.
Jockey,Jockeyis one of those sleepers that makes even a bumpy moviegoing season worthwhile. The film rests on the foundation of Clifton Collins's underplayed performance-he is quietly persuasive and likable...a hardscrabble hero worth rooting for
Jockey,"Collins, of course, is the movie's sturdy emotional spine, and Bentley wisely shoots him as such."
Jockey,"Sentimental yet also trickier and more complex than its gleaming surfaces suggest, Jockey is a portrait of a man facing his mortality or at least professional redundancy."
Jockey,"The framework, as predictable as it is, works because of the sincerity behind the endeavor and the depth of Collins' performance. He is the heart and soul of Jockey, and no one who gives it a chance will be forgetting his name anytime soon."
Jockey,Collins is convincing from frame one.
Jockey,"Jockey gives Collins the role of his career, and he leans into it with all he's got."
Jockey,"Collins often struggles to convey more than one clearly telegraphed emotion at a time, and rarely rises above the script's unimaginative demands."
Jockey,This revealing look at an enigmatic sports profession gives Collins a chance to shine -- and he is brilliant.
Jockey,"An evocative study of American life on the fringes that unfolds alongside the grand mysticism of stallions. Clifton Collins Jr. delivers a haunting, profoundly poignant performance."
Jockey,"You've certainly seen [actor Clifton Collins Jr.] before, but never quite like this."
Jockey,"Bentley's intimate character study shows a man coming to terms with his vulnerability, resting on a career-best performance from Clifton Collins Jr, who navigates the role of athlete and father with subtle but striking conviction."
Jockey,"Jockey is a modest, intimate film, to be sure, but an impressively assured one. It finds a lovely, low-key groove early on and maintains it, and draws performances from its key players that are terrific and true."
Jockey,"Though Collins is excellent, Jockey is a requiem with a considerably smaller range in comparison."
Jockey,"Somewhere between swagger and selflessness, win and lose, Jockey takes the home stretch."
Aftersun,"The easy pace of Wells’s direction brings out the best in her central performers, and the chemistry between Mescal and Corio plays out effortlessly. The light moments between them are warm and the darker ones linger heavily."
Aftersun,"A subtlety—a nuanced exposition of storylines that might have easily been too simplified—that one doesn’t often find in larger films, particularly American ones..."
Aftersun,Aftersun can be momentarily cathartic in making us confront the troubling ghosts of our past that tend to define our present. But it doesn't offer the false promise of healing in the future.
Aftersun,"Aftersun is a stealthy movie because even as it lulls you into a state where you’re wondering just what is the point of the whole endeavour, it has already successfully gripped you with its unsentimental heart."
Aftersun,"While Wells demonstrates a delicate and apparently very personal talent – she has said in interviews that her film is emotionally autobiographical – she will in the future, I hope, move on to more substantial material than this wafer-thin story."
Aftersun,"Somehow, without its effects becoming obvious, Wells brings us to the gravity of what she is remembering. The accumulation of small details builds a strong sense of who these characters are."
Aftersun,A tremendous film. Something that looks at a hard topic like depression in a very beautiful and human way.
Aftersun,"Aftersun is a film about belonging, aching loss, and making memories, and you will find yourself taking deep dives into personal pools of these elements, looking for your share of the sun."
Aftersun,"An ordinary film would lead toward an explosive ending, but despite the mounting tension there is nothing plot-driven about this subtle, piercing, small wonder of a film..."
Aftersun,"Wells knows exactly what she’s doing, and her storytelling is as precise as it is piercing."
Aftersun,"Wells' ability to capture the innocence of her past self, from a more mature and grown-up point of view is what makes her film into such an unusual piece of filmmaking."
Aftersun,"For all that Aftersun can be described as gentle, contemplative and even beautiful, it’s also the kind of film that feels as if it’s teetering on the edge of a cliff."
Aftersun,The power of the film is that it lives so firmly within the ambiguity of parental feelings.
Aftersun,"I had my top-five-movies-of-the-year list all sorted. Now - boom! - I’ve had to start from scratch. Damn you, Mescal, for being the cornerstone of something so beautiful."
Aftersun,Paul Mescal's film is a micro-masterclass in poignancy and heartbreak...
Aftersun,"The film is the first from Scottish director Charlotte Wells, the result such a gossamer knockout that the fact seems implausible, the movie made with a dizzyingly sharp eye for the universal stuff of growing up."
Aftersun,"So memorable and moving the first time, Aftersun is all the more affecting seen again. And again. It deserves all the prizes."
Aftersun,This mesmeric debut will make you want to stay suspended in its sun-baked setting with its two captivating lead characters for far longer than the runtime. A triumph of new British filmmaking.
Aftersun,"We see a Polaroid of father and daughter begin to develop but never come fully into focus, a powerful visual metaphor for Wells’s exploration of identity and a relationship that is just in the process of forming..."
Aftersun,"Thanks to Wells’s evident confidence, this story, constructed slowly and focused on small moments, is more mesmerizing than most..."
Aftersun,Charlotte Wells' promising debut feature plays with memory as a tool and lets its story unfold in dream-like waves.
Aftersun,"Every moment, every snippet of dialogue, every detail down to the smallest role or the tiniest detail in the background feels like a vibrant slice of real life."
Aftersun,"Aftersun is practically the definition of a ""small"" movie, but it sneaks up on you."
Aftersun,"I don’t want to oversell it — plenty have already — because it’s a clear-eyed poem of remembering, made from material usually treated as heart-tugging prose."
Aftersun,"Cheers to Scotland’s Charlotte Wells for making the best movie of the year by a first-time writer-director. And cheers to Paul Mescal and young Frankie Corio for bringing this unforgettable father-daughter story to such funny, touching and vital life."
Aftersun,"Aftersun is lyrical without ever being obtuse, and it's a film that flourishes when attention is paid to details."
Aftersun,"A stunner, a heartbreaker on love, grief and the random moments in life that solidify into haunting memories."
Aftersun,"A tribute to father-daughter relationships and the feeling of looking back on your childhood and realizing what your parents were going through, how much they loved you, and how you'll never really know who they were."
Aftersun,“Aftersun” stirs powerfully inarticulate emotions of what has been given and what is owed – what we had that we missed knowing we had and what we hold on to because it’s the only thing that’s left.
Aftersun,"A memory movie, not just a movie about someone’s memory but a movie about memory itself, presented in a flickering, sometimes kaleidoscopic fashion, present mingled with past, layered with understanding and regret."
Aftersun,"It’s hard to explain exactly how writer-director Charlotte Wells’s feature debut, “Aftersun,” pulls off the wave of emotion it instills in the viewer."
Aftersun,Mildly charming.
Aftersun,"A film to be experienced — just go with it — the full impact of “Aftersun” comes as the credits start to roll, and the processing begins."
Aftersun,"Aftersun cuts you in two with such emotional intensity, such impressive dramatic force, that I could only sit and fight back the inevitable tears."
Aftersun,"Aftersun has more to offer than the usual. What it lacks in answers, it more than returns in grace."
Aftersun,"You feel deeply for these characters, even after only a few scenes, and Wells aptly sucks you into their world."
Aftersun,The performances here are quiet marvels.
Aftersun,A work of masterful and almost unbearable melancholy.
Aftersun,"Though any honest summation can't do it justice, Charlotte Wells's tender feature debut is the kind of revelation that movie fans dream of finding: not a wow so much as a guaranteed piece of emotional ravishment."
Aftersun,"Wells, in her first feature, embraces the inherent messiness of it all perfectly. This is a collage of emotion pieced together from photographs, a souvenir rug, shaky home videos... the mind, of course, and the horrible/wonderful songs of that summer."
Aftersun,"I wept buckets, because writer-director Charlotte Wells so honestly realizes Sophie and Calum, and the potency and poetry of their father-daughter connection."
Aftersun,An act of imaginative empathy.
Aftersun,A beautifully sculpted and quietly shattering first feature from the Scottish writer-director Charlotte Wells.
Aftersun,"t’s deeply felt, a warm embodiment of a liminal time in life when our conceptions of ourselves and our loved ones come pinging into focus while also, somehow, drifting into new confusion."
Aftersun,The power of the film comes from its embrace of the basic and universal fact of loss.
Aftersun,"Aftersun feels like a combination of memory and hallucination, but rooted in truth."
Aftersun,"Rumors of something remarkable have circled around “Aftersun” since its première, at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, and guess what? The rumors are true."
Aftersun,I didn’t want Aftersun to end—and the desire to preserve and extend moments into infinity is what the movie is all about.
Aftersun,"A father and daughter resort holiday, viewed through a prism of wistfulness and regret, takes on magical meaning in this arresting feature directing debut by Scotland’s Charlotte Wells."
Aftersun,"Deftly constructed and utterly heartbreaking, Aftersun announces Charlotte Wells as an eminent storyteller of prodigious powers."
Aftersun,"“Aftersun” isn’t just an honest movie about the way that we remember the people we’ve lost — fragmented, elusive, nowhere and everywhere all at once — it’s also a heart-stopping act of remembering unto itself."
Aftersun,Aftersun is directed with a sure hand and immense empathy.
Aftersun,"An assured, aching, vibrant debut by Wells, “Aftersun” is a shattering remembrance of a father by his daughter."
Aftersun,A film that positively hums with atmosphere and glows with its maker’s promise.
Aftersun,What really sets the film apart is the way it subtly communicates an enormous sadness lurking just beneath the surface.
Aftersun,"The saving grace is Corio who, in a superb and memorable debut film performance, brings some much-needed naturalism and grace to proceedings."
Aftersun,"An exquisite revelation, Aftersun, produced by Barry Jenkins, is the type of movie from which you don’t walk away the same person."
Aftersun,"It’s a film of such restraint, oblique observation, and poised naturalism that the wallop of this feeling is quite unexpected. It heralds Wells as someone with a Joanna-Hogg-like career path beckoning right ahead, paved by a sensibility all her own."
Aftersun,"Wells’ measured but relentless probing, her careful peeling away of the layers of this intimate piece, mark her out as one of the most promising new voices in British cinema in recent years."
Aftersun,"Wells’s movie ripples and shimmers like a swimming pool of mystery; the way Wells captures mood and moment, never labouring the point or forcing the pace, reminded me of the young Lucrecia Martel."
Aftersun,The very subject of Wells’ feature is the gap between the sensory detail of a sun-drenched vacation and the unknowable interior lives of the characters. The result is a spellbinding duet by Mescal and Frankie Corio.
Aftersun,"Charlotte Wells’ sensuous, sharply moving debut shows that no amount of pool time and fruity drinks and Macarena dance-alongs can keep either the past or future at bay."
Aftersun,"While this is not explicitly autobiographical, it certainly feels like a very personal piece of work, and all the better for it. Oh, and the 1990s pop soundtrack is a joy."
Agnes,"A strange and beautiful tale of sex, religion, and dysfunction at the Carmelite convent of Santa Teresa."
Agnes,"A choppy, muddled mess of a movie that has its own identity crisis of what it wants to be or to show."
Agnes,"For all of its ruffled habits and bleeding eyes, Agnes is far sadder than it is scary (quite, versus not at all), and often sillier than it is sad."
Agnes,"Reece shows an intuitive understanding of when to move the camera, and -- more importantly -- when not to move the camera. It's all very elegantly put together."
Agnes,Constantly surprises and entertains throughout.
Agnes,"This choppy film has little to say, particularly about cloistered women, despite being named after a possessed sister and dedicating a plotline to an ex-nun."
Agnes,Sometimes this movie is unsettling; sometimes it's funny. Mostly it's a strange and fascinating inquiry into the nature of belief...
Agnes,"[Its] two sharply differentiated parts add up to much less than a coherent whole, in addition to being too underdeveloped and tonally wobbly to satisfy in themselves."
Agnes,The film is a thoughtful examination of the human desire for it and the accompanying hope that it may exorcise the emptiness we feel.
Agnes,"If... you're tired of seeing the same old beats hit again and again in these kind of movies, this will feel provides idiosyncratic salvation."
Agnes,"Yet another example of the wholly unique splendour of the films of Mickey Reece, Agnes shrewdly balances sincerity with the filmmaker's signature style of camp once again to extraordinary effect."
Of an Age,"Though the ending of Of an Age is dismayingly abrupt, much of what’s come before is sweet and erotic and wise about the fits-and-starts process of coming out -- chiefly to oneself."
Of an Age,...the male performances are of the first order and the screenplay is sensitive and intelligent — you hope that Stolevski will go on to make even better movies in the future.
Of an Age,Of An Age is a queer Australian romantic drama brimming with tenderness and enchantment.
Of an Age,It’s a tribute to the persuasiveness of both actors that they do more than survive the intensity of the camera’s scrutiny.
Of an Age,A memorable blast of humanity and nostalgia...
Of an Age,"A profoundly moving film about the beauty and the horror of what it means to be seen for the first time, to love for the first time, and how the past and future are constantly informing each other."
Of an Age,"The Australian production is a warm-hearted gem, pulsating with lustful tenderness (and tender lust) as it sketches what first love can feel like, and asking whether it can ever endure."
Of an Age,"While “Of an Age” offers plenty of moody, melancholy atmosphere, it lacks the kind of characterization that would make this story truly devastating."
Of an Age,"Anton and Green are outstanding, and their chemistry is infectious."
Of an Age,Stolevski holds our attention with small moments he makes feel huge. This is just confirmation that the You Won't Be Alone filmmaker is a major talent to keep an eye on.
Of an Age,"The magic of Of an Age reveals itself in the natural rhythms of Stolevski's storytelling, and the unhurried nature of his script."
Of an Age,"A remarkable double performance on an emotional level, delivered in two otherwise slender chapters."
Of an Age,"It helps that the two actors glow in each others’ presence, turning up the heat onscreen."
Of an Age,The ambivalence with which the film treats its main character’s revelation proves rich with complication and offers a new intervention into a genre we thought we’d fully internalized.
Of an Age,"On its own, it’s a nicely drawn vignette, tapping a palpable sense of desire between the two leads."
Of an Age,"Do we really need another tragic period gay love story? How about yes, but do it better."
Of an Age,"There’s more here than longing, with Stolevski making a U-turn late in the film, and taking us to a staggeringly beautiful and heartbreaking destination."
Of an Age,"Indie Australian director/writer Goran Stolevski's remarkable and moving chronicle of a love encumbered by time, place and circumstance...""Of An Age"" is one of the best films of this young year so far."
Of an Age,"The film delicately embraces grand sentiments without ever being sentimental. And throughout the journey, we can’t help but be enthralled."
Of an Age,"The specificity of Of an Age’s subject matter, combined with its stale handling of said material, only lets the film serve as a reminder of better works that came before it."
Of an Age,"Stolevski has burdened his characters with such obvious narrative instrumentality... that the two simply never come to life as people, either as individuals or as a couple."
Of an Age,A brief but vivid encounter.
Of an Age,"In other hands, Of an Age could have been gimmicky or indulgent but Stolevski imbues his characters with such lived-in specificity that we can’t help but be swept away."
Passages,"A film that is profoundly real, impactful, and even uncomfortable, but above all, is an artistic and complex story about three people confronted with their own sense of morality. [Full review in Spanish]"
Passages,"What emerges is a torrid, gripping drama that acknowledges not just what damage the careless can wreak but also to what extent the responsible often conspire in their own annihilation."
Passages,Passages is smart and precise about other people’s messes. It’s a way to indulge in the most volatile parts of ourselves without ever feeling like we’re about to lose control.
Passages,"From the way Sachs shoots the streets of Paris, it’s obvious he adores New Wave film-makers like Truffaut."
Passages,"As often in his [Ira Sachs] films, bourgeois comfort is a façade; resentment’s a cauldron; and the practical setup of people’s lives is in danger of gazumping their destinies."
Passages,Passages deserves to find the widest audience among fans of “grownup” cinema.
Passages,"Passages is one of the best love triangle movies I’ve ever seen, primarily because it is about the fluid nature of not just sexuality but desire. And as Tomas, Rogowski gives an electrifying, star-making performance."
Passages,"... A forensic analysis of the ebb and flow of power in all relationships, and the psychological make-up of those who wield it best."
Passages,"Anchored by excellent performances from its three intertwined leads, Passages is alternately tender and thorny in its close character study of a narcissist, and as a romantic drama with no winners."
Passages,"As a portrait of artistic monstrosity, the film would make a great double bill with Tár. As with that film, you also get the uncomfortable feeling of being drawn into the orbit of the beast."
Passages,"Rogowski, Whishaw and Exarchopoulos are all black-belt performers and they bring this film to vivid and sensual life."
Passages,"Passages is lean, effective drama, with minimal dialogue, always in the middle of things, not offering explanatory beginnings or ends."
Passages,Passages harks back unapologetically to a time when art cinema was synonymous with sexual candour.
Passages,"Passages is a refreshingly candid portrait of life, love and sexuality in the 2020s."
Passages,Sachs’s tempestuous love-triangle drama feels like a precious anomaly within the landscape of contemporary American cinema.
Passages,"This is a smart, lustrous film, and a bracingly honest one, the kind of movie that leaves you feeling both invigorated and a little blue."
Passages,"Passages features all the intimate humanity of Sachs’s last decade of work, but he adds a wonderfully bitter edge and a sharp humor in its depiction of a love triangle..."
Passages,"The escalation of events, rapid but inevitable, feels natural in its pacing and indicates the rightness of tone established by Sachs and his frequent writing partner Mauricio Zacharias."
Passages,"Sachs and his performers are alert to the delicate and wordless ways bodies move toward and away from each other, in overture to sex and sometimes in rejection of it."
Passages,Sachs’ best film yet.
Passages,"If you can admire a movie’s technique (and its hotness) above all else, you’ll enjoy “Passages.” For me, it’s an intriguing near-miss."
Passages,"In Sachs’s sensitive hands, Passages becomes something new and strange, not least because the filmmaker is so willing to forthrightly address the consuming sexual attraction that pulls and pushes the three protagonists at nearly every turn."
Passages,"Young people should see “Passages” for warning and instruction. They need to recognize the Tomases when they turn up, because people like Tomas can use up years of a person’s life."
Passages,Passages has done as much as it can to make Tomas a figure of interest. The director simply doesn’t make the cut.
Passages,The film captures the moods of relationships in transition without ever being condescending or judgmental.
Passages,"Rogowski carries the film, and it is quite the performance — one whose appeal is difficult to work out in your head, which makes it all the better."
Passages,"Its sophisticated approach to romance (or, perhaps, the absence of it) is not too cool or alienating, because Sachs and his sterling cast give the film such textured, specific life."
Passages,"Unrelenting and frank, Passages captures the creeping discontents of its Fassbinder-lite protagonist without losing sight of how his transgressions affect those around him."
Passages,"You can find hundreds of egotistical monsters who’ve graced movie screens, but few of them can compare to Tomas Freiburg."
Passages,"One of those dramas about a horrible person that movie critics tend to love and often I am one of those critics, but, boy howdy, not this time."
Passages,"Sachs leans heavily on his actors, all terrific."
Passages,"It’s a testament to Rogowski’s performance that Tomas’s appeal remains apparent despite his behavior, that his gravitational pull is understandable even as you long for the others to escape it."
Passages,"“Passages,” far from being an elegant love triangle, is more like a quadrilateral of desire. And the shape of it shifts, right up to the bitter end."
Passages,"Sachs frames one talk between the spouses with Tomas’s body eclipsing Martin’s until he’s invisible; the camera reflects how little Tomas sees his partners, too. But capturing these truths leaves a void in the film."
Passages,"A briskly-moving, turbulent, emphatically sexy, deliberately exasperating love triangle."
Passages,"The final passages of Passages feel at once sad and inevitable, suffused with a wisdom that, for Martin and Agathe, feels both hard-edged and hard-won."
Passages,The trio of actors are wonderfully chaotic and all empathetic in their own way. But Whishaw is particularly excellent as one of the poor souls swept up in Tomas’ cyclone.
Passages,"You'll squirm and grit your teeth as this egomaniac leaves a trail of emotional destruction in his wake. You may even shout ""No!"" at the screen as if it were a haunted house picture."
Passages,The film carries the almost exotic interest of its milieu as well as deeply personal overtones.
Passages,"It's sexy, sad and so very French"
Passages,"Rogowski arguably does the best work of his career, capturing the kind of fragile masculinity that often typifies creatives."
Passages,"It’s an extremely European film from the American director Ira Sachs, full of homages to classics of European cinema, and a portrait of a rascal and the helplessness of the human heart."
Passages,"I wanted to scream and throw things at the screen, but I guess that’s part of the allure of ""Passages."" "
Passages,"With Tomas, Sachs has created a fictional character who’s no alter ego but an ideal of sorts: he embodies the freedom of thought and action on which the very notion of art is based."
Passages,"What makes Passages worth watching isn’t the bare facts of its plot, but the ways that Sachs’s careful, nearly invisible style, matched to his actors, generates all manner of sudden, fluid, intelligent sensations as we watch."
Passages,"Through studious long takes, a textured look, and playful choreography, Sachs’ Passages examines the ever-evolving nature of sexuality and attraction with both intelligence and a sense of humor."
Passages,"A signature new drama from a director whose best work is at once both generously tender in its brutality and unsparingly brutal in its tenderness, the raw and resonant Passages is the kind of [mess] around and find out love triangle that rings true."
Passages,Its dramatic heft and its stars’ upfront audacity make it a sexy proposition in every respect.
Passages,A messy little movie about a specifically awful brand of narcissist who will be frighteningly familiar to many of us who have known him and even more so to those who might well be him.
Passages,"Sachs excels at investigating thorny, uncomfortable situations, and he treats all three characters fairly here, which allows audiences to decide which one they identify with."
Passages,Cast and crew all at the top of their game. Bravi.
Passages,"Adroit casting, writing, editing, performing & costuming shade the outline of an affair to a finely sharpened emotional realism, the cycles of fighting and reconciling we’ve all seen before regaining in rawness as if we’re now the ones living through it."
Passages,A wise and unusually wounding work from a beloved indie auteur.
Naked Singularity,The wait continues for a new movie worthy of the talents of John Boyega.
Naked Singularity,"Not even an impending apocalypse adds much in the way of urgency. Still, Boyega is very credible and at 29 he's beginning to look like a leading man with real gravitational pull. Likely he'll file this on his CV under misfire."
Naked Singularity,"Chase Palmer, the film's director and co-writer (with David Matthews), hacks away at this thick forest of high concepts and plot detail, but it all just keeps growing back, making for a tangled mess that's as irritating as a stroll through a nettle patch."
Naked Singularity,"Even as Mexican cartels, Hasidic money-launderers, modal realism explanations and a samurai sword pile up around the action, ""Naked Singularity"" stubbornly refuses to engage."
Naked Singularity,It's difficult to think of anything that exactly works in Naked Singularity. Even the villain muddles the message the movie wants to send.
Naked Singularity,"There's something off-kilter about [Naked Singularity], in a good way. It has a confidence that might not be earned but is still enjoyable to see."
Naked Singularity,"""Naked Singularity"" welds legal drama and science fiction into a misshapen crime caper."
Naked Singularity,"""Naked Singularity"" may be set in that second world of bold choices and revolutionary acts, but it certainly wasn't made in it."
Naked Singularity,A weird mashup of ill-fitting genre tropes and quarter-cooked ideas about social justice and alternate realities.
Naked Singularity,The brisk pacing and capable cast still can't quite mask a certain routine feel in a movie without much heart.
Mayday,Filmmaker Karen Cinorre's initially provocative vision of misandrist vengeance at least makes Mayday worth a look.
Mayday,"It's an interesting cast and it's a beautiful film. Kind of falls apart by the end, but I liked it for a while."
Mayday,"Despite a strong ensemble of actors and some impressive photography, Mayday drowns inside its own overambitions."
Mayday,"This is a music video, not a film, with storytelling that neither shows nor tells."
Mayday,Cinorre's opening is electrifying but its focus eventually wavers like a faraway radio signal.
Mayday,"For a film about misandrist revolutionaries, ""Mayday"" lacks the courage of its convictions - it sets up boogeymen as targets only to shoot them point blank, in broad daylight."
Mayday,"The film circles a thorny premise, which makes it all the more disappointing that it results in a conventional clinch."
Mayday,A curious magical realism metaphor for feminist despair...
Mayday,"With no tension, no suspense and no dramatic engine behind this plunge through the looking glass, Cinorre's film feels less like a narrative than an incredibly polished advertising campaign..."
Mayday,For viewers happy to go with the flow... this will be fun enough.
Mayday,"While the plot is not always entirely coherent, Mayday is strikingly styled and suffused with a punchy, militarised feminism."
Mayday,"Mayday seeks to examine the issues of gender, suicide, and youth through a thin fantasy lens, but it never finds a confident wavelength and meanders when it needs to be world building."
Mayday,"It's a shame that ambitious vision doesn't extend to its characters - where they're from, who and what they love, the real experiences that inform their resiliency."
Mayday,"Despite a rigid, smart setup, ""Mayday"" sloughs off its sharper elements with increasing regularity."
Sweetwater,A perfectly affable telling of the integration of the NBA.
Sweetwater,"The direction, acting, script and production team are all in play, but nothing scores."
Sweetwater,"What begins with a frame recalling “Driving Miss Daisy,” unfortunately, quickly descends into “The Legend of Bagger Vance.”"
Sweetwater,Makes you realize that the history of basketball is ripe with vital stories that haven’t gotten near the big screen.
Sweetwater,The result is competent and informative but lacks swagger and elegance.
Things Don’t Stay Fixed,It's a pretty minor movie with some nice touches around the edges... The director has some gift for atmosphere that could be better utilized with a better script.
The Son,"Zeller's too smart to make a truly ""bad"" movie, and there are some interesting ideas here... But the messaging is so blunt, and the narrative descent so predictable, it leaves little room for actual emotional engagement."
The Son,"A badly misjudged melodrama, this domestic tale is bogged down in heavy handed histrionics and sentimental notes that makes you want to run away."
The Son,"Zeller explores how sadness repels; how people involuntarily recoil from depression, perpetuating the isolation of the sufferer."
The Son,"There are no ill intentions behind The Son, but sometimes stories are so badly judged and naive in their execution that they turn ugly."
The Son,"Nicholas’s pain should overwhelm us. It doesn’t, because it’s not allowed to."
The Son,Jackman resumes conveying psychic trauma with the air of someone thinking he might have lost his car keys. But it’s the film that has the character flaw no actor could redeem.
The Son,"Everything is a little too self-conscious, but the longer the film goes on — and it does rather go on — the more it seems this artifice might be a deliberate choice, to make the entire world as dishonest and uncomfortable as Nicholas sees it."
The Son,"It’s plain torture, cruelly manipulative yet also hopelessly underwritten, once taken out of the theatre, into the light."
The Son,The actors penetrate the murk to make something very touching out of their response to the tragedy which is threatening to derail all their lives.
The Son,The Son is immaculately acted and staged.
The Son,There’s no doubt that Zeller takes this subject seriously. But his conceptual skill isn’t matched by his writing of scenes. And the writing for Nicholas is particularly underwhelming.
The Son,"While it deals with topics such as depression and suicide head on, it handles them in a rather clunky manner, and comes off more like an after school special than a reasoned, serious drama."
The Son,"Hugh Jackman acts his heart out as a parent unable to cope with his clinically depressed son, but even he can’t save this poor relation to The Father from descending into two hours of misery porn."
The Son,"With all the market research and focus groups that drive the movie world, it's rare for something as poorly conceived as ""The Son"" to make it through the cracks."
The Son,A disappointing melodrama with a twist ending that’s as predictable as it is egregious.
The Son,Jackman can’t overcome an emotionally manipulative screenplay and an amateurish young co-star.
The Son,"Tears need to be earned, and The Son fails at that."
The Son,"Quite simply, a disappointment, from its pat setup to its equally false — and, quite frankly, cruel — resolution."
The Son,The actors do good work.
The Son,"The Son is a film that is very cruel to its characters, and by extension to its long-suffering audience."
The Son,"It’s not often I watch a movie that feels downright irresponsible, but The Son has claimed that rare honor."
The Son,"The Son is a bold, harrowing and unflinchingly sobering film that is admittedly not for every taste, but an unavoidably intelligent piece of filmmaking for mature viewers that I highly recommend."
The Son,A stunning misfire.
The Son,The problem I have with this is that it just telegraphs everything.
The Son,"This film has an intelligent ambiguity that I liked, even if it's a letdown following The Father."
The Son,Well-intentioned but poorly constructed.
The Son,"Although there are individually powerful scenes, the narrative arc feels contrived and there’s a scene near the end that is unforgivably manipulative (and completely unnecessary)."
The Son,The Son is the latest addition to a recent crop of movies to present grief and trauma in ways that imply that Hollywood is the first to ever discover both.
The Son,The apple falls lamentably far from the tree where Florian Zeller’s “The Son” is concerned.
The Son,"The movie may take place inside a pit of despair, but the theatrics leave us with the uncanny sensation of feeling nothing at all."
The Son,"If you don’t have children, you will likely walk out of The Son shaken and deeply moved. If you do have kids, you may have to be eventually pulled to your feet after collapsing into a fetal ball for several hours."
The Son,It doesn't take long to sense that Zeller is making something darkly cynical and a bit sadistic. You see it in Jackman's increasingly furrowed brow and distracted eyes.
The Son,"The fable of Nicholas and Peter has the brittle feel of a setup. Over and over, as situations are constructed, you can spot the payoff coming..."
The Son,The Father is such an achievement that it’s hard to believe The Son was made by the same person.
The Son,"It plays as maddeningly glib reduction of lived experience, with blame parceled out like a punishment. And to what end?"
The Son,"A melodrama that thinks it’s saying something important but it’s just yelling in your face, unwilling to do the character work to understand its subject beyond what it can do to provoke an audience with it."
The Son,"All by himself, Hugh Jackman imbues The Son with a tragic power that makes even Florian Zeller’s most manipulative excesses easier to tolerate."
The Son,"Please, Post editors, I beg you — do not make me review “The Third Cousin Once Removed”! I can’t take much more chic French ennui!"
The Son,"It is a flawed film with a kind heart, but a significantly less impressive progeny of The Father's talky triumph."
The Son,"The results feel less like a film than an upmarket soap opera, down to the mind-numbingly tasteful decor of Peter’s apartment."
The Son,"It’s compassionate, acutely observed but also rather conventional."
The Son,"Despite boasting some big names, Florian Zeller's follow-up to The Father is a missed opportunity to tackle the weighty subject of teen depression."
The Son,"While there’s great value in a film so willing to confront the terrible fact that love isn’t always enough, The Son doesn’t know how to do that without spiting us in the process."
The Son,"The elegant austerity of Zeller’s direction makes the outcome a given, which turns The Son into a punishing slog."
The Son,"In watching “The Son” play out, this family’s tragedy becomes our own, and Zeller’s warning becomes impossible to ignore."
The Son,I’m unsure about that showy final scene. But this is such a powerful and literate film.
The Sleeping Negro,"Myers’ film doesn’t shy away from addressing challenging subject matter, chipping away at the ridiculous claim that “race” doesn’t matter in contemporary America."
The Sleeping Negro,"Myers' brisk film is more monologue than movie, but undeniably essential in jolting everyone out of the collective complacency induced by the false perception of progress for all in this country."
The Sleeping Negro,"Though often abstract in its imagery, the film's blistering commentary remains firmly rooted in our present reality."
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,"Despite its alluded sweetness, [Aitch Alberto] succeeds in imposing an almost palpable esthetic sensibility, and of course, succeeds in extracting the best from her young actors. [Full review in Spanish]"
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,Aristotle and Dante is distinguished by its atmosphere of compassion in which expression thrives.
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,"The stories of growing up and finding yourself remain the same, but it’s the moving performances and specific details embroidered on this one that make it so special."
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,"A less sentimental, wish-fulfilling approach to Mexican American identity, gay self-discovery and Reagan-era Texas will wait for another day. Until then, fans of “Heartstopper”-style slow-burn romance will eat up this tender film’s subtle charms."
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,Both young actors are immensely likable in an immensely likable film that reminds us that it’s important to be true to who we are.
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,"A sweetly effective sketch of two souls adrift who find harbor with each other. Anchored by strong performances from Pelayo and especially Gonzales, beautiful cinematography...and cool choices in music...""Aristotle and Dante"" is worth discovering."
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,"It’s easy to reduce “Aristotle and Dante” to a queer coming-of-age story, but as told, it’s also one of the most well-rounded teen movies around."
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,"First and foremost a work of queer expression, this is the kind of YA cinema kids deserve."
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,"Aitch Alberto’s story is less about coming out and more about standing in your truth, whatever that may be."
Aristotle and Dante Discove…,"For all its fumbles, I found Aristotle and Dante to inspire more indulgence than annoyance."
Mending the Line,"The drama captures the way two wounded warriors from opposite worlds can overcome trauma, find comfort in nature and, potentially, mend themselves."
Mending the Line,"[It] has a rote TV-movie look and a few bland and rambling passages. But it delivers a truth about those who have served, about the reality of the demons that can linger in them, that’s tough and moving."
Mending the Line,"The movie is worth a look for its lovely and magical fly-fishing sequences and stirring Big Sky vistas (shout out to cinematographer Eve Cohen), as well as its strong cast..."
Mending the Line,The middling material is often elevated by the performances.
Mending the Line,"Through its setting and performances, “Mend the Line” has just enough going for it to recommend it."
The Aerialist,One of the most revealing movies about the dancer's life ever made.
Lorelei,Even the beats of Lorelei that feel manufactured connect because of the tenderness of the filmmaking and performances.
Lorelei,"Elevated by Jena Malone and Pablo Schreiber, debut feature filmmaker Sabrina Doyle's tale of Americans on the fringe is compassionately textured even when it veers into cliché."
Lorelei,"The film is invested in accurately depicting the details of its character's lives, but its collection of studied impressions doesn't coalesce into a coherent final portrait."
Lorelei,"Malone... is outstanding as a woman who, in some sense, has been in a prison of her own the past 15 years, waiting for that break in life that may never come."
Lorelei,An uneven blue-collar melodrama lifted by its leads.
American Traitor: The Trial…,"Whatever Williams spent on the front-row seat she may or may not have bought herself here, we can only hope it was more worth it for her than it will be for anyone else."
American Traitor: The Trial…,"Period re-creation is decent (the interiors-heavy film was shot entirely in Puerto Rico), Polish effectively peppers in bits of archival footage, and the story is often involving despite its missteps."
American Traitor: The Trial…,"The film never deeply engages the issues of consent, culpability, and justice it asks us to consider."
American Traitor: The Trial…,Michael Polish's post-WWII courtroom drama is a must for Al Pacino completists.
American Traitor: The Trial…,"Clumsy, campy and kitsch, but also deadeningly dull for long stretches..."
American Traitor: The Trial…,"If Mildred Gillars has a story worth telling in a feature film, this isn't it."
American Traitor: The Trial…,"With twin brother Mark, Michael Polish has directed acclaimed oddball indies such as ""Twin Falls Idaho,"" ""Jackpot"" and ""The Astronaut Farmer."" But humanizing fascist collaborators takes more than just an offbeat cinematic sensibility."
Death of a Ladies’ Man,"It’s an insubstantial little film with slimly conceived characters, but Byrne adds at least 10 points to its IQ score and makes it twice as watchable."
Death of a Ladies’ Man,"The screenplay, by director Matthew Bissonnette, is leavened with flashes of curious humour - like the assertion that the Canadian National Anthem is Cohen's Bird on a Wire."
Death of a Ladies’ Man,Byrne's most remarkable achievement lies in the fact he never allows Samuel's incurable self-absorption to become boring.
Death of a Ladies’ Man,[A] likable and melodic dramedy from Cohen enthusiast Matthew Bissonnette.
Southern Gospel,Southern Gospel is better than expected faith entertainment.
Southern Gospel,"A ""Preacher's Kid"" movie that succeeds in its presentation."
Southern Gospel,"Many aspects of Southern Gospel are predictable, but solid performances from most of the cast members help overcome some clichés of faith-based films. This biopic of Dream Church founder Samuel Allen also benefits from having good original songs."
Southern Gospel,"Mildly engaging and non-preachy, but somewhat overstuffed, undercooked and cloying. It's not quite as powerful and moving as I Can Only Imagine."
Southern Gospel,"Entertaining and uplifting, the movie really won me over with its inspirational nature."
Southern Gospel,"This message of faith and grace is one that resonates deeply as it reminds us that we have a God who gives us second, third, and fourth chances and who welcomes us back with open arms."
Dreamin’ Wild,"It’s a lot to pack into a seemingly unassuming little movie, but Pohlad—who also directed 2014’s superb Love & Mercy—pulls it off."
Dreamin’ Wild,"[The] feelgood story of a long dormant musical dream finally realized was enough to earn major press attention, but is it enough for a feature-length film? Probably not, which is why writer-director Pohlad piled on the melodrama and leaned into clichés."
Dreamin’ Wild,It raises all kinds of familial guilt issues that are really interesting.
Dreamin’ Wild,"In some ways this movie is restrained by the fact that it's a true story. If some of that could be let go, a better movie could've been had -- but it is good."
Dreamin’ Wild,Casey Affleck does strong work as Donnie Emerson...
Dreamin’ Wild,"A well-cast, modestly affecting drama... it boasts a generous heart gently dusted with life’s complications as it beats a familiar rhythm of easygoing redemption."
Dreamin’ Wild,"A lot of talented people give it their all, in a film that is both thoughtful and rewarding. I liked it a lot."
Dreamin’ Wild,"A standard biopic of a story like this could easily write itself. Thankfully, writer/director Bill Pohlad has brought their tale to the silver screen with [a] thoughtful, humanist lens."
Dreamin’ Wild,"Dreamin’ Wild suffers from the occasional corny moment, and some of the dialogue is too direct, tending to spell out what ought to be implied. But Mr. Affleck easily holds the film together with another captivating performance."
Dreamin’ Wild,"Despite all the talent on display navigating an authentically intriguing true tale, Pohlad’s joint never quite finds its rhythm."
Dreamin’ Wild,"While it can occasionally seem as though Pohlad is eking out conflict to support a narrative, the film’s restraint ultimately works in its favor, offering a thoughtful meditation on music, creativity and what it really means for talent to be “overlooked.”"
Dreamin’ Wild,The elegantly underplayed performances ensure that the film never succumbs to melodrama.
Dreamin’ Wild,"Pohlad’s sweet, slightly sorrowful film [is] the lower-key B-side to his previous one — a poignant examination of what happens when a star is conceived, but not born."
Dreamin’ Wild,"There is a gentle loveliness to Pohlad’s filmmaking, everything from sun-swept Eastern Washington State vistas to teenage parties to live performances, but the heartwarming gradually overheats."
Dreamin’ Wild,"The movie is itself sort of a B+, or a 7 or 8 out of 10."
Even in Dreams,"This mild dramedy is like a dot-to-dot of what happens as a band makes it in the music industry: It's an identifiable picture, but it lacks the color and definition needed to make it a work of art."
Nights of Cabiria,"Fellini and Masina's unique collaboration appears to demolish the wall between life and art, film and audience."
Nights of Cabiria,What makes the character so poignant is that her final fortification is not her street wisdom -- that's all surface -- but her innocence. Her ultimate protection is our sympathy for her.
Nights of Cabiria,This Academy Award-winner for Best Foreign Film is always cited as one of Fellini's greatest.
Nights of Cabiria,"Cabiria's story is indeed heartrending, but neither director nor actress allow her time for self-pity."
Nights of Cabiria,"Through [Masina's] unforgettable performance, Cabiria will endure as long as anyone cares to watch transcendence projected on a screen."
Nights of Cabiria,One of the finest collaborations between husband and wife ever committed to film.
Nights of Cabiria,"Masina is immensely touching, through an extraordinary range of emotions."
Nights of Cabiria,"It's fascinating. Part of the fascination is in seeing how much of it is intrinsic, untarnished gold; and, as with most earlier works of masters, part of it now is in seeing the hints of the Fellini to come."
Nights of Cabiria,"The gift of Cabiria's essence, freed from the determinism of stories, is to return us to our own."
Nights of Cabiria,The most perfectly beautiful and touching of Fellini's movies.
Nights of Cabiria,"A deep, wrenching and eloquent filmgoing experience."
Nights of Cabiria,"As artificial as Cabiria's behavior sometimes seems, it always seems her own, and this little woman carries herself proudly through the gutters of Rome."
Empire of Light,"Empire of Light is a dull historical romance that isn’t even amusing enough to be offensive. It has its moments, but you’d be hard pressed to remember them later."
Empire of Light,"These are tricky scenes to bring off, but Mendes has written them with such care and Colman performs them with such a delicate awareness of just how far they should be taken that the swift changes in pace and tone don’t hit a false note."
Empire of Light,"The main location for the film was a real cinema that had fallen into disrepair and was restored to its former magnificence. It provides a vital centre for this poignant, intelligent, handsome film."
Empire of Light,"The central romance between Hilary and the devastatingly handsome new usher, Stephen, played by Top Boy’s promising star Michael Ward, never rings true. Nor does Hilary’s sudden shock at discovering racism in Margaret Thatcher’s Britain."
Empire of Light,"Watching the misguided artistry at work in Empire of Light, it’s hard to fathom just what attracted so many top-tier talents to a project of such torpor."
Empire of Light,"Hilary and Stephen have been buffeted all their lives by the message that they are less-than, undeserving, unimportant. Empire of Light highlights the ineffable joy when both discover that none of that is true."
Empire of Light,"Empire of Light is neither a convincing age-gap love story, nor does it authentically evoke the 1980s. It is baffling anyone could have managed to set a film in an old cinema while failing to capitalise on the potential for film-loving romance."
Empire of Light,Mendes has called it a tribute to his own mother. Others have declared it a love letter to cinema. So why is it so oddly impersonal? So cold? So closed off from its audience?
Empire of Light,"Empire of Light is... very much another film about the glory of cinema itself. That message comes within a conundrum of a movie: well-acted and well-meant, strikingly melancholy, but prettified and artificial too."
Empire of Light,Little convinces as anything other than a first-draft screenwriting exercise.
Empire of Light,"Throws more into the pot that it knows how to deal with, but some good stretches."
Empire of Light,"For all its visual flair, courtesy of veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins, there’s little to suggest that Mendes has the writing chops to match his directing skill."
Empire of Light,"At its best, it is genuinely evocative, and while the script is patchy, it also wisely leaves the camera — plus Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ delicate, pensive score — to do a lot of the talking."
Empire of Light,"The magic of film-going is the theme but there is almost no film-going in it and what there is isn’t magic. Peculiarly soulless, pedestrian and plodding, it is, however, wonderfully shot by Roger Deakins."
Empire of Light,"The way to celebrate cinema is to make a good film, not to lecture about it in a bad one."
Empire of Light,"Late in the film, Hilary asks projectionist Norman (Toby Young, appealing) why he made a particular momentous decision; his mystified reply may match the viewer’s own as to what Mendes had in mind here."
Empire of Light,There is nothing subtle about writer-director Sam Mendes’ Empire of Light.
Empire of Light,"Empire of Light is so dewy and sentimental, it’s practically moist. What’s more, it’s almost desperate to be the kind of film that wins awards. A shame, because it wastes an excellent Colman performance."
Empire of Light,"Colman, talented trooper that she is, gives it her all — but I wasn’t buying."
Empire of Light,"The film smothers its authentic parts, never lets its drama take root and grow, never lets its characters come to life."
Empire of Light,The problem is that it's muddled by taking on too much... It's fragmented and meandering.
Empire of Light,"Too clumsy to effectively tie its thematic threads together, and too schematic to stir the heart."
Empire of Light,"Empire of Light spells out lots of things that it might have conveyed with a glance, or a line of understated dialogue. It stumbles under the weight of its intentions, and not even its majestic setting can save it."
Empire of Light,All life appears to have been drained out of this movie.
Empire of Light,"Empire of Light never entirely coheres, but it's worth seeing for the power of Colman's lead performance and the expertly judged backup acting."
Empire of Light,"Onscreen chemistry is always difficult to measure, more dependent upon our connection to the actors and their personas than we care to admit. Still, Colman and Ward, two tremendously talented performers, capture as much spark as damp wood."
Empire of Light,"Earnestly crafted and intentioned, mostly avoiding over-simplifying the struggles of its characters or offering trite solutions to complicated issues – but there’s still a whiff of falseness to it."
Empire of Light,“Empire of Light” has such enticing visuals and such thoughtful performances it can almost lull audiences into forgetting that the storyline and characters are like pieces from different jigsaw puzzles.
Empire of Light,"It has many bright, powerful moments, most of them courtesy of Colman or Deakins, and perhaps that's how ""Empire of Light"" is meant to be experienced — as little pieces that capture bits of human behavior or conflict before moving on to the next piece."
Empire of Light,"That’s four very different movies on the marquee, and none of them is particularly convincing or memorable."
Empire of Light,"We don’t need someone to remind us that movies are magic by stating that up front, usually it’s the magic of storytelling itself that achieves that, which “Empire of Light” ultimately, and unfortunately, fumbles."
Empire of Light,Olivia Colman keeps killing it.
Empire of Light,"There's little heat to Empire of Light, and a styrofoam staleness to its treatment of the important topics of then and now."
Empire of Light,"We may come to Empire of Light like moths to a flame but, ultimately, the film’s glow lacks incandescence."
Empire of Light,"There's a thin line between affection and myopia; ""Empire of Light"" skews too heavily toward the latter."
Empire of Light,"Colman, on whose face the film frequently rests (does anyone in cinema have a more open, guileless smile?), quietly holds the drama in her hands."
Empire of Light,"The message is muddled and soft, like a Milk Dud at the bottom of the box, and the movie chews on it for quite a while."
Empire of Light,"Olivia Colman delivers an alternately delicate and ferocious performance as a cinema manager in “Empire of Light,” a tender, tear-soaked valentine to the ineffable joys of moviegoing."
Empire of Light,A cinematic car wreck that’s not only miscalculated and misconceived but misplayed.
Empire of Light,"Although the scenes transpiring within the Empire Theater mine a deep vein of nostalgia, the clunky and uneven storyline doesn’t give the cast enough to work with."
Empire of Light,"Empire of Light may be a love letter to the movies, but it’s a sad one..."
Empire of Light,"There are films in which the performances are so strong and persuasive that they compensate for the story's contrivances and weaknesses. Such is the case with ""Empire of Light."""
Empire of Light,"If a central thesis of Empire Of Light is that 24 frames per second can generate magic, Colman is walking (and crying, and dancing, and smiling) proof of that."
Empire of Light,The movie is a glossy wreck.
Empire of Light,"There is a certain odour wafting out of writer-director Sam Mendes’s Empire of Light that approximates the stomach-churning scent of scalding, rancid butter ladled atop stale popcorn."
Empire of Light,Performances all around are solid. The faulty screenplay doesn’t materialize into a worthy or profound film. This was a waste of everyone’s time and talent.
Empire of Light,A treasure worthy of its own magnificently-crumbling Art Deco Screens 1 and 2.
Empire of Light,Film is truth at 24 frames per second; reality is a fist to the face.
Empire of Light,"The movie has a genial sense of humour, and there are cute moments... But it’s hard to buy into its cathartic vision of a unifying cinema in a film with a dubiously lopsided approach to its leads."
Empire of Light,"It’s not saying anything new but it’s a heartwarming reminder of the joy, comfort and necessity of the big screen experience."
Empire of Light,"Empire of Light isn’t about anyone’s memories, not really."
Empire of Light,A film that works in its minor character beats but fumbles enough of the major ones to push viewers out of the very spell it’s trying to cast.
Empire of Light,"In Sam Mendes’s film, the power of the movies comes off feeling disappointingly like an afterthought to the script’s more romantic and socially oriented concerns."
Empire of Light,"Mendes, who wrote the script, skirts hoary cliche (and worse) by staying close to Stephen and Hillary, these portraits of people in flux so finely wrought by Colman and Ward."
Empire of Light,Olivia Colman can’t save Sam Mendes’s befuddling nostalgia trip.
Empire of Light,"An engrossing, poignantly observed and beautifully acted drama about love, life and the fragile art of moviegoing..."
Empire of Light,"The performances are affecting across the board, but we knew that Mendes was good with actors. We’re less accustomed to seeing him as a writer... His plotting can be formulaic and some of the dialogue falls rather flat."
Empire of Light,It’s an unwieldy union of kitchen-sink drudgery with rapturous celebration of the moving image.
Empire of Light,A nicely acted misfire from director Sam Mendes.
Empire of Light,"Colman, her eyes darting between hope and devastation, is so lit-up and specific (and funny, a quality that doesn't seem to get mentioned enough) that she lifts nearly every scene."
Empire of Light,"A frustratingly uneven and often meandering period drama written by Mendes, loosely drawing remembrances from his own formative years."
Empire of Light,You can hear the narrative cogs turning.
Empire of Light,It’s wonderful that Mendes spent the pandemic making a movie about the irreplaceable vitality of movie theaters... It would have been even better if he spent the pandemic making a movie worth seeing in one.
Empire of Light,"The deeper you get into Mendes’ story, the tougher and more unpredictable it gets."
Contempt,"Bardot and Piccoli are deeply sympathetic as a couple in free fall, the locations are invariably stunning and the score by Georges Delerue is so heartbreaking and epic that Scorsese borrowed it, re-using it with equal power in Casino."
Contempt,"Godard, himself working with American co-producers and facing demands to insert nude shots of Bardot (whose fees constituted half the film’s budget), turns this conflict between culture and cash into an ironic, self-reflexive odyssey."
Contempt,"Contempt could not be termed good or poor. It seems a little remote, and unless you are interested in films, or want to view some beautiful scenes of tasteful sensuality, you can pass it by."
Contempt,"""Contempt"" transports us back to another era: an early '60s world in which the classicism of the past...is juxtaposed with the emptiness and ennui of modern culture."
Contempt,"The film is about nothing but cinema itself, which gets a bit wearing, unless you are one of those people who like watching a movie in order to check off the references to other movies. Still, it's a masterwork of some sort."
Contempt,Steeped in melancholy and a sense of mourning.
Contempt,"The miracle here is that for all its use of irony and self-reflexive devices, Le Mepris still ends up with a considerable emotional punch."
Contempt,"This is one of the French new wave master's seminal films, a satire on the making of a Hollywood-style movie that exploits Bardot's femme fatale Camille with no less aplomb than Hollywood itself."
Contempt,"Uncompromising, uningratiating film-making."
Contempt,"A knowing, tragic-comic aria for love and moviemaking."
Contempt,Possibly Godard's most melancholy film and probably his most beautiful ...
Contempt,A rich and heady cocktail of the various things swimming around in Jean-Luc Godard's mind at the time of its production.
Contempt,
Contempt,
Contempt,
Contempt,"What's the price of selling out? Contempt asks the question of its characters, its audience, and its own director."
Contempt,"Godard sets interesting scenes, with provocative color combinations and a suggestive pictorial flow. But out of it all comes nothing -- or very little that tells you why this wife is so contemptuous of her husband. Maybe he should be contemptuous of her!"
Contempt,"Inevitably a melancholy film, but a memorable one as well."
Contempt,It emerges as one of Godard's most emotional films.
Contempt,I would argue that Godard's eclecticism must be acknowledged and understood before one can genuinely appreciate the film.
Contempt,"Contempt was Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 attempt at a big-budget, big- star production, and more or less satisfied his curiosity."
Contempt,"It's not Godard's best film, but it is one of cinema's most interesting looks at itself, masquerading as a love story gone awry."
Contempt,"It takes its artistic agenda seriously, but also luxuriates in the sensuality and plasticity of film images."
Contempt,"This one has too much forced intellectualism to it, even though it is an engrossing time capsule."
Gully,"The plot here didn't work for me, but I really adore this cast and I think this director will make something great."
Gully,"A movie... needs to go somewhere, and ""Gully"" basically doesn't."
Gully,"Uncertain what story it's telling, Nabil Elderkin's Gully is only held together by the sheer talent of its young cast."
Gully,The film overreaches or overstates at every significant moment...
Gully,"Its raw, gritty approach feels like an effort from the filmmakers, but it's mostly work for the audience to endure."
Gully,Music video director Nabil Elderkin steps into the deep end of feature filmmaking and flounders.
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"It's all rather cleverly worked out and there's enough here to draw on. Certainly from a young adult level there's something to see here, but it tries to too much in too many different ways. I give them points though for creating aliens that [look new]."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Once you get past the aliens’ appearances, it’s easy to be mesmerized by the film at large, which is a sweeping and heartfelt examination of colonization, voyeurism, capitalism, and humanity."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"It’s a lovely little film, and features two great performances from Blackk and Haddish."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,A slyly subversive sci-fi satire that packs a sensory kick.
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Finley deserves credit for adding extra wrinkles to Anderson’s story, but “Landscape with Invisible Hand” doesn’t cut deep enough to leave a mark."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Cory Finley presents an up-and-down satire, both deeply weird and totally original, with a dry sense of humor and takeaways that are funny, messy and unsettling, sometimes all at once."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,“Landscape With Invisible Hand” is profound. You’ll probably feel uncomfortable with the many questions it raises... But that’s the point.
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Landscape With Invisible Hand is the perfect answer to the sci-fi franchise machine, and exactly what we need in 2023."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,Landscape With Invisible Hand never seems scattershot because Finley keeps the characters grounded amid the insanity.
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"It gets strange in smart, interesting, and thought-provoking ways, combining big ideas and careful attention to the smallest details."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Finley’s allegorical gestures toward issues of class, race and authoritarianism are more than apparent, but the film’s tonal inconsistencies make the satire wobble."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,There is much to like.
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Landscape with Invisible Hand is a cutting satire about economic imperialism, the commodification of culture, and the degrees to which human beings are forced to debase themselves in order to survive."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,While his [Finley] latest isn't as refreshing as his past films in how it does so... it has enough thematic tissue to hold together until an appropriately evocative end.
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Features some impressively staged sequences and terrific performances, but awkwardly straddles the fence between biting social commentary and dark humor, never quite finding its footing and ending on a curiously flat note."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Corey Finley's M.T. Anderson adaptation loses track of the filmmaker's unique voice, but proves his knack for big-budget visuals and storytelling. In the end, Finley’s ambitious outing is just that: ambitious, without much else to back it up."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,Landscape With Invisible Hand elegantly tells a complicated sci-fi story.
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"“Landscape with Invisible Hand” wants to be admired for such cynical send-ups, but its commentary is nowhere near sharp enough."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"The Vuvv are not unlike the wealthy class we already have now — using technological advancement as an excuse for the rapid destruction of empathy. It’s a blunt indictment of capitalism’s cruelty, which constantly asks us to pay for our freedom."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"It's not a film about killing aliens or outrunning laser beams but about the economic fallout of an alien invasion: How do you live with them, and how does this shape future human interaction?"
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Finley undoubtedly benefits from rich source material, translating Anderson’s book with what is quickly becoming his deadpan sense of humour."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"This could be a scathing indictment of our country’s growing class divide. Instead, it’s a nice-looking, entertaining movie that conveniently pulls its punches."
Landscape with Invisible Hand,The helplessness baked into this sci-fi tale of economic surrender gradually builds into a moribund sense of dread that stifles most of its laughs.
Landscape with Invisible Hand,"“Landscape with Invisible Hand” is, at best, an ambitious failure."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","It's all very amiable, casual and lovely to behold, but needs a little more friction to spice things up."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","Viewers may wish there were more to it, but what's there is teasingly intriguing."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","Ma Belle, My Beauty feels uninterested in its characters' motivations and their main source of conflict-how to manuever the complicated cogs of the polyamorous machine..."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","Anchored by four very good performances, Ma Belle, My Beauty unfortunately suffers from inertia and a lack of conflict."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty",Hill seems so averse to calling attention to the struggles of polyamory that the characters shy away from any real conflict.
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","Thoughtfully written and produced, Ma Belle, My Beauty exemplifies the potential of small-budget filmmaking."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","The acting from the central four actors is quite soulful, but we don't get enough access to these characters' inner conflicts."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","New writer/director Marion Hill takes her sweet time laying out the story, rivalries, jealousies and flirtations."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","All told, it's an absolutely enchanting pleasure that pulls us whole-bodied into its sway."
"Ma Belle, My Beauty","While the film is not without its flaws and missteps, it's hard not to be grateful to enter its world of sex and feelings and food and nature."
Holler,"Jessica Barden gives a performance of great sensitivity and subtlety in Holler, an evocative depiction of the Sisyphus-like experience of poverty in a depressed economy."
Holler,"Holler is a gorgeously-textured exploration of the way ruthless corporatism trickles down through each layer of a country, and a system, until it falls on the shoulders of a young girl and obscures her future. Jessica Barden pens sonnets with her silence."
Holler,"Miss Barden is just wonderful in this movie, but so is everyone else."
Holler,"Honest, gritty, and thoughtful."
Holler,"Jessica Barden, Pamela Adlon and Gus Halper knock it out of the park with the girtty tale of escaping the trash heap of poverty for a better life. Kudos Nicole Reigel for sharing your heart!"
Holler,"While the broad strokes of Nicole Riegel's story might sound familiar, ""Holler"" finds its power in the particularities, especially Jessica Barden's unfussy and wholly believable performance."
Holler,"Barden's central performance is as tough and honest as the film calls for, and even if a closing riff feels slightly borrowed from ""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Holler"" is a solid entry in the Midwest Desolation canon."
Holler,A modest classic -- hopefully the first of many from a major new voice in American cinema.
Holler,An unflinching autobiographical work about what it takes to lift oneself out of this marginalized life.
Holler,"Holler is a compassionate film, and a worthwhile one, even if Riegel gets her points across bluntly."
Holler,"For all the scenes of desperate people doing desperate things in order to stave off literal starvation while working dead-end or downright criminal jobs, Riegel somehow manages to imply short, sharp shock of actual hope by film's end."
Holler,"Even the medium - Super 16-millimeter film, in the era of digital - adds to the ambience of rusting, abandoned machinery."
Holler,"The film's bleak outlook is leavened with a ray of hope, when she decides to take a road less travelled."
Holler,"A film that is heart-rattlingly poignant, haunting, and among the best of the year."
Holler,"[A]side from the scraggly forests and ominous smokestacks that writer-director Nicole Riegel films in gorgeous, grainy 16mm there's not much that's memorable about this story."
Holler,"Holler is a compelling, confident film about family, loyalty, hope and self-care, executed with a firm directorial vision and speaking with an authenticity and genuineness that is unambiguously refreshing."
Holler,"Riegel seems to still be hung up on Winter's Bone, making a slavishly imitative film with few flourishes that allow it to stand on its own."
Holler,"The director has a secret weapon in Barden, who makes Ruth's story relatable, even to those who've been fortunate enough to avoid such hardship."
Monday,"I didn't get a feel for their chemistry... It felt unconvincing, underdeveloped, and kind of pointless."
Monday,"When they were just roaming around beautiful Greece, I was enjoying the movie. When they get into the story? Nah."
Monday,That's the beauty of Argyris Papadimitropoulos's follow-up to Suntan; it's a movie that accurately reflects the highs and lows of relationships once the dust of a fling starts to settle and the work begins.
Monday,The movie becomes a less than appealing blend of rave and rut.
Monday,"Even when your head knows better, the heart doesn't always follow. It's as predictable as the Monday morning that follows the Friday night. 'Monday'"
Monday,"Try though the actors may, they're unable to make us care about characters who are primarily defined by their lousy decisions and who lack the spark to draw us closer to their flame."
Monday,Get a room...far away form here.
Monday,"All in all, Mr. Papadimitropoulos maintains a delicate balance between the wryly hilarious and the heartbreaking, and sometimes the high wire trembles. But danger is intoxicating."
Monday,"As we watch these two likable wrecks try to carve out a place for themselves in the world, we can't help but see something of ourselves in them."
Monday,"That gorgeous stranger at the bar may stay gorgeous, Papadimitropoulos suggests, but the antics of youth and whirlwind romance have an undoubted expiry date."
Monday,"While Papadimitropoulos and his cast capture the perma-vacation feel that permeates Mickey and Chloe's happiest moments, he's less adept at navigating the heftier emotional elements."
Monday,"Papadimitropoulos doesn't say a whole lot here or offer much of a lesson. This may not be a fatal problem, but it can feel trying; better to watch this film on a Friday, when you have no reason to rush through life."
Monday,"As the couple's once-thrilling romance quickly wanes, so does the movie."
Monday,"Sebastian Stan, the Winter Soldier himself, shows he can sizzle with costar Denise Gough for a romcom romp in Greece that starts on a sexy, swooshing high before draining out the fun for dramatic insights that never come. Bummer."
Monday,"Romance is often gussied up with noble heroes, dastardly villains, slapstick shenanigans, or MPAA-taunting eroticism. Monday rejects all of these adornments and is nonetheless a stunner."
Monday,"Papadimitropoulos has a particular feel for sun-baked hedonism and atmosphere, and Gough and Stan are extremely game."
Monday,"This honest examination of a passionate, disastrous, adult relationship, might feel like a warning itself. Papadimitropoulos doesn't offer easy answers, but what ""Monday"" brings is something tangibly real and profoundly human."
Monday,You just don't feel that heat.
Monday,"A sharply observed, well-acted picture with a lot of tart detail and a few real stings in its tail."
Monday,"Sebastian Stan has the moody skill as an actor to pull this off. Yet the movie, which at times feels semi-improvised, isn't structured to allow the central relationship to build dramatically."
Monday,"What starts out as a sexy, sun-soaked romp becomes a heartbreaking examination of two people who are absolutely wrong for each other."
Monday,"Ultimately, the film is unable to overcome the mundanity of its simple, overly familiar scenario."
Monday,"Anyone else who's ever been in a relationship like this... will painfully relate to Monday's sensual, funny and above all honest look at amour fou."
Monday,I never got the impression of a genuine connection between the two stars. There was no chemistry.
Monday,The impressive follow up to Suntan from Argyris Papadimitropoulos crackles with energy and stings with honesty.
Confetti,"Confetti is a little predictable and comfortable, but heartfelt."
Confetti,"Dyslexia is still not officially recognised in China, something writer/director Ann Hu clearly aims to change with this awareness raising, semi-autobiographical story."
Confetti,"Writer/director Ann Hu, who based the film on her own experience, has a gift for subtle details that illuminate character and culture."
Confetti,Confetti doesn't step too far off the beaten path of such concerned-parent dramas.
Confetti,"A little too glossy for its own good, ""Confetti"" nevertheless will resonate for those who can relate to this family's plight."
Il conformista,It's easy to overlook how stark The Conformist's political and allegorical message is because it's just so damn beautiful.
Il conformista,"It's yesteryear remembered with a combination of nostalgia and repulsion, a queasy combination that defines the film and gives it a kind of hideous allure."
Il conformista,"The unsettling blend of images and ideas in this movie cannot satisfactorily be disentangled or decoded, and it's the very strangeness of Bertolucci's masterpiece that has made it so influential in cinema history."
Il conformista,Bertolucci's boldest and most expressive film ...
Il conformista,"Photographed by Vittorio Storraro, it's a mlange of the sensual haziness of '70s European art-house fair and the high-contrast, anxious angles of film noir"
Il conformista,"The Conformist is celebrated for cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's tumbling autumn leaves, but its emotional impact involves a tumbling soul."
Il conformista,"The art house meets Hollywood neo-noir in Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist, a film that isn't recognized enough as the masterpiece that it is."
Il conformista,All hail the revival of one of Bernardo Bertolucci's best films.
Il conformista,A beautifully imagined portrait of moral and political cowardice.
Il conformista,Bertolucci's film has the compelling quality of a bad dream.
Il conformista,A visual masterpiece thanks to Storaro's keen eye and Bertolucci's assured direction.
Il conformista,Ravishing to the eye but less than fully satisfying to the mind.
Il conformista,"The movie is pure magic as story, as drama, as photography, as conviction, as everything except its ideas."
Il conformista,"Juggling past and present with the same bravura flourish as Welles in Citizen Kane, Bertolucci conjures a dazzling historical and personal perspective."
Il conformista,... seems every bit the masterpiece it was when first released by Paramount.
Il conformista,"As striking as Bertolucci's classic looks, there's even more powerful stuff in the storytelling."
Il conformista,An eye-watering testimony to the erstwhile dash of international cinema.
Il conformista,"There are excesses in the film, but they are balanced by scenes of such unusual beauty and vitality that I couldn't care less."
Il conformista,"[A] beautiful, complex, massively layered adaptation of the Alberto Moravia novel."
Il conformista,"The brilliant mix of ideas, the audacity and originality of approach, the sensualist delight in the ravishing play of light and shadow -- all these remain, as bracing and inspirational as ever."
Il conformista,"Storaro and Bertolucci have fashioned a visual masterpiece in The Conformist, with some of the best use of light and shadow ever in a motion picture."
Il conformista,More like a symphonic poem than a movie. Your breath is taken away by its baroque compositions.
The Youngest Evangelist And…,ERROR
Little Fish,"O'Connell - a very good actor of whom I feel I haven't seen enough recently - is tender and sympathetic as Jude, and Cooke is similarly intelligent and gentle as Emma."
Little Fish,Cooke is marvelous. She carries this movie through all of its various ups and downs with magnetic grace.
Little Fish,"Maybe that's the greatest surprise of the movie, after all: Obsessed though it is with the past, throughout its whole runtime, the best part always lies ahead."
Little Fish,The film almost lost me but recovered by focusing on the intimate story of one couple. That's what makes Little Fish palatable-and moving.
Little Fish,"The lackluster Little Fish banks on the automatic pathos of its subject matter, unaware that such delicate material actually requires greater skill and finesse to pull off, now more than ever."
Little Fish,Beautifully done with intimate cinematography... A lovely film.
Little Fish,"I really was won over by this, I think in part because Olivia Cooke is an actress I never get tired of."
Little Fish,"The result is better than smart, it's stirring. With the NIA pandemic as a pretext, the essential subject becomes memory -- its fragility, its wondrousness, its centrality to our existence as sentient beings."
Little Fish,"Hartigan never strikes a hysterical tone, resulting in realistic horror within the recognizable confines of daily life."
Little Fish,"Built around dreamlike cinematography and Keegan DeWitt's melancholic score, this is an inventive exploration of the hardships and pain of losing a loved one that speaks from the heart."
Little Fish,"Hartigan's moody evocation of Emma and Jack's love - and the way in which it, like so much else, is predicated on knowledge of the past - casts a moving spell."
Little Fish,A haunting pandemic love story.
Little Fish,"For the most part, though, ""Little Fish"" is a heart-gripping two-hander between people trying to save their love."
Little Fish,"The film eclipses its conceit, delicately examining both the unique pain that is the loss of intimacy and what makes us fall in love with someone again and again."
Little Fish,"It's a class act - from the devoted acting to the touching screenplay, and is one of the most genuine love stories I've seen this decade."
Little Fish,"Once you're swept up in Emma and Jude's romance - it's not hard, even though the montages veer a little too precious - the skimmed-over science matters little. This is sci-fi rooted more in feelings than fact."
Little Fish,"The film gets at the profound truth that our relationship with another person is, at its core, a collection of shared memories."
Little Fish,"""Little Fish"" is a loving ode that stands on its own as a creative, inventive romance for a broken time."
The Starling Girl,“The Starling Girl” lives and breathes through Scanlen’s stellar performance.
The Starling Girl,"Laurel Parmet makes a striking, assured feature directorial debut with “The Starling Girl,” which serves double duty in solidifying Eliza Scanlen’s already pretty solid reputation as a young actor worth watching."
The Starling Girl,"Parmet is confident enough to know that atmosphere, emotional tone and unspoken feeling can convey far more meaning than the talkiest of dialogue."
The Starling Girl,Parmet's less interested in cultish dread than a more naturalistic dullness of isolation and groupthink you'd find in any closed conservative society where women of faith have been sold a purity narrative.
The Starling Girl,It’s a refreshing change to see this milieu treated with the level of nuance that Laurel Parmet brings to “The Starling Girl.”
The Starling Girl,"The saving graces of writer-director Laurel Parmet’s debut feature are the detailed portrayal of a community the movies generally caricature and Scanlen’s intuitive, impulsive Jem."
The Starling Girl,"A tender tale, “The Starling Girl” twirls through a spate of clichés... but sticks the landing thanks to Parmet’s rapt attention to the shifting desires of her central character."
The Starling Girl,The film is an impressively complicated and compassionate drama about shame and desire.
The Starling Girl,"Scanlen shines, but everything around her is dull."
The Starling Girl,"The language and strictures of their religious community are perfectly rendered by writer and director Laurel Parmet, who captures the complicated interplay of power and immaturity that can blossom in isolated communities."
The Starling Girl,An insightful portrait of coming of age Christian.
The Starling Girl,Parmet shows dramatic confidence as she sets up a story that serves as a reminder of how dominant religion-based societies are in significant swaths of American life.
The Starling Girl,Scanlen’s work here is steeped in the feeling of a real-life being lived right in front of you.
The Starling Girl,The power of this sensitive and devilishly detailed coming-of-age drama is rooted in the friction that it finds between biblical paternalism and modern personhood.
The Starling Girl,"Scanlen can portray miles of emotional growth with a few short minutes. Films of this tricky variety often hinge on the central performance, and in her hands, it mostly works."
The Starling Girl,"Parmet’s strong script and surety behind the camera navigates the audience through this complicated story of religion and sexuality, patriarchy and power, brought to eerily accurate life by the ensemble of excellent actors."
Scrapper,"Delicately dancing the knife edge between too-cute and over-maudlin, the filmmaker and her terrific actors have given viewers that rarity in cinema: uplift without the dreary moralizing."
Scrapper,Lola Campbell just [gives] a great performance... she and Harris Dickinson have really fun chemistry.
Scrapper,I love this movie so much. This is going to end up in my top 10 list at the end of the year.
Scrapper,"Campbell is a revelation. This is her first movie role, and her performance is flawless."
Scrapper,"It’s a highly implausible scenario but, using a touch of absurdism, British writer-director Charlotte Regan pulls it off. With this sunlit film, she’s not making the usual gritty example of working-class naturalism we expect from the British."
Scrapper,"Lively, fluid camerawork by Molly Manning Walker – who recently won Un Certain Regard at Cannes with her directorial debut, How to Have Sex – chimes with the lovely two-step between Campbell and Dickenson. As plucky as the title suggests."
Scrapper,"Scrapper is a solar system of a film, with Campbell’s playful and defiant Georgie shining bright at its centre. You’ll not find many characters this year quite as likeable."
Scrapper,"Regan, a pop-promo veteran, is so invested in quirky interstitial sequences (talking spiders, fantasy outfit swaps) and Wes Anderson-style line readings that she leaves little room for engagement."
Scrapper,An amazing directorial debut.
Scrapper,"Watching these two mutually suspicious strangers stumble toward forming a family makes Scrapper an invigorating treat, like finding wild flowers bursting out of broken pavement."
Scrapper,"If you appreciate no-frills finesse, you’ll be floored."
Scrapper,"This is Regan’s first feature, and it often feels like one, in both good and bad ways."
Scrapper,"It’s colourful, tender and sweet with quirky moments that are grounded in magical rather than social realism. And it’s just 84 minutes long, which is a boon."
Scrapper,As engagingly scrappy as its name suggests — both pugnacious and fragmentary — Scrapper has plenty going for it.
Scrapper,“Scrapper” is tender without falling into sappiness.
Scrapper,Charlotte Regan’s film is a baffling clash of two incompatible visions.
Scrapper,"Just hanging out together on camera is much more difficult than it looks, and Dickinson and Campbell manage it well. Regan looks like a very impressive and capable movie talent."
Scrapper,"There are few surprises in Scrapper, except its sickly sweetness: the girl is pushy but sweet, the friend is messy but sweet, the father is tough but sweet. Everyone is sweet: so is its twee style."
Scrapper,Charlotte Regan’s debut is a captivating one thanks to the engaging two leads and the two authentic characters they portray.
Scrapper,"A striking debut feature from Charlotte Regan, Scrapper is a charming and genuinely funny family drama with a heart of gold."
Scrapper,Campbell and Dickinson are perfectly in tune with each other in the two-hander...
Scrapper,"Scrapper is just one of those sweet, funny films that takes pleasure in the wonder of youth, with really tight, honest writing that is unexpected and fun."
Scrapper,A promising debut that is honest about the complexities of father-daughter relationships.
Scrapper,"“Scrapper,” which seeks to parse through the fears felt in grief, change, and maturation, is full of rare heart, a spunky embrace of ambitious empathy."
Scrapper,A sweet bit of fluff that’s trying too hard to be funny and offbeat and ends up being too often simply annoying.
Scrapper,"Stylistically bold and youthful in approach, if sometimes a little uneven, it’s a picture packed full of ideas and fizzing energy."
Scrapper,"Rehashes a host of familiar elements from assorted kitchen-sink dramas and dysfunctional parent-child stories, painting them colorfully enough that audiences won't mind the odd bit of rust."
Scrapper,"Though it doesn’t strive for the dramatic highs and lows its actors could probably pull off, Scrapper is a smart, sensitive debut and a promising arrival for its talented director."
Scrapper,"What happens next isn’t any great surprise: these two lost souls are actually soulmates. But Regan, who also wrote the script, has so much empathy for them that she convinces us their story needs to be told."
Monica,"Lysette’s committed, complex performance, in tandem with Clarkson, powers a restrained tale of reunion and resistance with a gender identity twist."
Monica,"Monica is moody, slow-moving and stronger on style than characterization, yet Lysette and Clarkson endow it with feeling."
Monica,"Monica is an intimate look at the complexity of grief, reconciliation and family."
Monica,"A quiet, heartfelt, and beautifully nuanced drama that feels unique and universal."
Monica,"Director Andrea Pallaoro doesn’t burden this delicate tale of reconciliation with long monologues or extensive back stories, and the performances are compelling in their restraint."
Monica,"Pallaoro refuses to tell this story, co-written by Orlando Tirado, in a conventional and tidy movie-of-the-week manner, which is evident even in the framing of individual shots where main character’s faces are sometimes cut off."
Monica,Placing a uniquely trans story in the center of a well-worn road creates a path to a new sentiment to be granted to a tale that many people have and will face in their life.
Monica,Monica is an unsentimental exploration of its main character’s search for personal fulfillment through human connection.
Monica,"Monica is a wondrous work in terms of painting with light, in which the select shadows tell their own story."
Monica,"Monica is a gently-paced film that doesn’t pack an obvious emotional punch, but carries rewards for those invested in the characters and the subject matter."
Monica,"Director and co-writer Andrea Pallaoro banishes easy sentiment and proselytising in this touching film, allowing the audience to take a journey with the titular Monica and discover her story on the way."
Monica,"“Monica” raises the bar for trans stories onscreen, and Lysette takes her rightful place as its muse."
Monica,"With uncommon sensitivity toward the interior lives of its characters, as well as to the shifting codes of trans representation, “Monica” is a film about making amends, where the person who deserves the apology is also the one doing all the work."
Monica,"The result, alas, doesn’t live up to the promise of the occasion, turning the character’s journey into fodder for a sluggish exercise in formalism."
Monica,Pallaoro trusts that we can read between the lines and that Lysette can carry many silent scenes where Monica is existing in closed spaces and trying to find some kind of peace.
I Can,"But, that said, I Can doesn't really have much character development, and it moves rather quickly, ultimately feeling like it's more about Eric and his issues than Katelyn."
My Salinger Year,"You can't help comparing it to The Devil Wears Prada, which is sharper and funnier and more bitter...but it's the very definition of a film that goes down nicely, there are better things it can be but worse things too..."
My Salinger Year,"Sigourney Weaver and Margaret Qualley are two of the juiciest actresses in America and, thanks to them, this period drama is never less than tantalising."
My Salinger Year,Any film that can take an actor as sparky as Qualley and deliver a character with the personality of a damp dishcloth wrapped in a cardigan is seriously underusing its year in New York.
My Salinger Year,"Lacking in style and substance, would benefit from a major redraft."
My Salinger Year,"Weaver is the secret weapon, the book trade made flesh."
My Salinger Year,"If you're an aspiring literary type, this is the film for you: a sweet - if slight - entry in the coming-of-age canon, buoyed by strong turns from Qualley and Weaver."
My Salinger Year,"For J. D. Salinger completists, the dramatic adaptation of Joanna Rakoff's memoir may be unmissable."
My Salinger Year,It has a lot of heart and brains. I really liked it a lot.
My Salinger Year,The kind of wry worth catching...
My Salinger Year,"My Salinger Year miraculously maintains a certain appeal, thanks in large part to Margaret Qualley."
My Salinger Year,"A lot going on in ""My Salinger Year,"" though perhaps not enough of consequence to make audiences feel particularly beholden to the filmmaker."
My Salinger Year,"Joanna's journey of creative and emotional enlightenment... is managed with grace, tenderness and touching credibility by a wonderfully winning Qualley in concert with Philippe Falardeau's smart, engaging direction and screenplay."
My Salinger Year,"Muted almost to the point of effacement, this limp adaptation of Joanna Rakoff's 2014 memoir, written and directed by Philip Falardeau, only affirms that what might work on the page doesn't always pop on the screen."
My Salinger Year,The film fails to effectively seize on how its main character's life and work experiences have affected her as a person and artist.
My Salinger Year,"It's a coming-of-age story told with a sophistication that only makes it all the more touching. In recalling her youth, Rakoff is revisiting a time which has a nostalgic glow attached to it for anyone remotely interested in the power of the written word."
My Salinger Year,"My Salinger Year is a satisfying watch, although perhaps not one of the year's most memorable films as such."
My Salinger Year,"All of this comes across strongly in the film, but on one occasion Falardeau takes a really bold step into fantasy..."
My Salinger Year,"But really it's a movie, essentially familiar in structure and tone, that owes everything to a pair of knockout performances. It's a casting triumph."
My Salinger Year,"This has open horizons, and a winning naïveté."
My Salinger Year,"Although an actor of considerable charm, Qualley struggles to imbue the role with much in the way of texture or substance."
My Salinger Year,"""My Salinger Year"" often trips on the self-serious nature of its premise, and struggles with an antiquated quality out of sync with its timeline..."
My Salinger Year,Could use an edit.
My Salinger Year,"It's a running theme that writers are different than most people would probably imagine. But when it comes to accepting Joanna as one of them, the film never convinces."
My Salinger Year,"A simperingly coy knock-off of The Devil Wears Prada without the sexiness and fun, and so wet that in the immortal words of Molesworth, you could shoot snipe off it."
My Salinger Year,"A pleasant and diverting film, then, that may leave you craving more of the egotism and rancour that seems to seep from every pore of New York literary scene."
Silo,"The plot in ""Silo"" ultimately proves too thin, with not enough fleshing out of either the shared history of the characters or the particulars of the extraction."
Silo,"The shooting is picturesque, the acting overbaked."
Silo,"Sumptuously filmed by Hunter Baker, it's a testament to simple but effective filmmaking."
Silo,If Burnette's formal instincts are suboptimal - the pervasive backlighting and underlighting keep much of the action in shadow - his dramatic instincts are worse.
iMordecai,"In the title role, Hirsch schmears it on a little thick and schticky, while Astin largely looks irritated. In an underwritten part, Carol Kane maximizes every half-smile and gesture, bringing warmth and sly humor."
Hard Luck Love Song,"""Hard Luck Love Song"" is the kind of movie that would sit right next to someone at the world's saddest dive bar even if the place was full of nothing but empty seats."
Hard Luck Love Song,Justin Corsbie's self-indulgent indie is not worth the effort of making a disparaging pun based on its title.
Hard Luck Love Song,Michael Dorman does great work as a small-town hustler pursued by gangsters.
Hard Luck Love Song,"Hard Luck Love Song's ultimate turn is a twist too far, and perhaps to a fault the film's most memorable moment."
Hard Luck Love Song,"""Hard Luck Love Song"" is a happy but gritty marriage of material, filmmaker and star. Much is asked of Dorman, and he delivers all."
Hard Luck Love Song,The twists are violent and silly and have little relation to the gritty realities of Snider's world.
Hard Luck Love Song,"What could have been a taut, gripping, emotional story ends up being diluted by a surrounding narrative that meanders and moseys to the point of irrelevance."
Hard Luck Love Song,"As with many country songs, the story feels terribly familiar. But director/co-screenwriter Corsbie, who grew up in Austin, clearly knows the milieu."
Summertime,"It feels like Slacker for a new generation, which I really appreciated... This feels like one of the most L.A. films I've ever seen."
Summertime,"I love this film as much as it loves Los Angeles, which is deeply."
Summertime,"The movies have a long history of ""kids putting on a show."" ""Summertime"" belongs to that tradition even as it expands its boundaries into the heartsore world offscreen."
Summertime,"On paper, it sounds iffy; in execution, however, it's absolutely glorious, a gleeful glide through adolescence."
Summertime,"There is something to be said about good intentions in filmmaking, but Estrada's sincerity overload feels like mush."
Summertime,"""Summertime"" expresses familiar sentiments in some fresh and vital ways, and keeps the dreams alive."
Summertime,"What could have been a botched experiment morphs into something special, a scrappy feature that is electrifying from first frame to last."
Summertime,An exuberant hodgepodge of everyday joy and frustration (and the occasional mild trauma).
Summertime,"Ultimately, this is the undoing of ""Summertime,"" a movie that uses spoken word poetry as its guiding light. The direction limits, rather than expands the words of its performer-poets."
Summertime,"It's a bold attempt, putting a neo-realist spotlight on a bevvy of first-time and nascent actors, but presented under an obnoxious treacle banner."
Summertime,"Likewise, the collaborative spirit of the project is inspiring, enough to recommend the film to creative teenagers and theater kids of all ages. The poetry can be pretty engaging, too, once you get over yourself."
Summertime,"It does take a little time to hook into the movie's rhythms. Once you do, however, you're hooked for the duration."
Summertime,"Not only did Summertime open my eyes to a form of expression I was dismissing but it also offers the chance to experience something important to another. Whether you can relate or not, sharing truths in such a raw fashion is bound to make an impression."
Summertime,"López Estrada and company not only subvert lazy assumptions about their misunderstood metropolis and who lives and thrives there, but they also shift the focus to the unheard and unseen for a wonderful reinvention. You'll never see LA the same again."
Summertime,"The entire film feels a little like that, gushingly supportive at the expense of any real dramatic tension; it's ultimately more of an everyone's-a-winner showcase than the messy vision of a community it appears to be aspiring towards."
Summertime,"Estrada's film sounds just like teen spirit, with big, beating hearts that all share center stage."
Summertime,"While this hodgepodge contains the occasional lovely or eloquent moment... those are overshadowed by material that grates on all but the most forgiving ear, in a semi-narrative setting that clearly just cares about getting from one aria to the next."
Summertime,"If ""Blindspotting"" was an ode to Oakland, then ""Summertime"" is the corresponding hallelujah to L.A., capturing what it means to be alive right now in the City of Angels."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"Not a film for everybody, but if you start it you'll absolutely watch through the end. Quite literally breathtaking."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"[A] lean, stylish and frequently heartbreaking drama..."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"Airtight sound design, rich visuals and natural performances tell a poignant story."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"Writer-director Robert Machoian has fashioned a wintry, clenched tale of domestic strife here, confining all but one sequence inside the 4:3 aspect ratio."
The Killing of Two Lovers,This is a compelling portrait of a toxic marriage.
The Killing of Two Lovers,"From such simple beginnings through to all the complexities life can throw at a family, then back to the primal struggles anew, director Robert Machoian's first solo feature achieves technically what it sets about to portray emotionally, a rare feat."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"It's beautiful to look at. It's very painterly... It's glacially paced, but that didn't bother me particularly. Very bleak, but incredibly well-acted."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"Crawford's David is quietly devastating: a man who will do whatever it takes - sing a shaky ballad to his sweetheart in the car, build a rocket, pick up a gun - to keep what he loves."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"There's terror at the heart of this movie, a terror that reaches far into the future of these peoples' lives. This is the sign that the myopia of the film's frame isn't a miscalculation. It is a judgment -- a predictive one"
The Killing of Two Lovers,The Killing of Two Lovers is a masterful portrait of male pain and the toxic masculinity that might make it dangerous.
The Killing of Two Lovers,The considerable power of this movie stems from those emotional contradictions and from Machoian's refusal to reconcile them easily or predictably.
The Killing of Two Lovers,It's worth exploring for a number of reasons -- primarily the strength of Crawford's performance -- and those who do not have a problem with raw and unflinching dramas may indeed find it well worth watching.
The Killing of Two Lovers,"It's a rare kind of movie magic to wrestle through this mess of a man and realize that the mysterious nature of his fate proves the only natural outcome, because no simple ending can do justice to a life bereft of easy answers."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"Director/screenwriter/editor Machoian is firmly in control throughout The Killing of Two Lovers, deftly sustaining a slow-burn tension in this unflinching story of a disintegrating marriage."
The Killing of Two Lovers,"Machoian suggests that a single day of experience can cover the worries of wrangling youngsters, the ache of troubled romance, and the wildest rage."
The Killing of Two Lovers,It's a film stripped of any pretense; everything about it seems to bear the hand of a veteran filmmaker. And the performance from Crawford is shattering.
The Killing of Two Lovers,"Ultimately, a movie like this succeeds or fails largely on the strength of its lead actors, and Machoian cast his well."
The Killing of Two Lovers,The film's cramped compositions hauntingly underline the claustrophobic nature of its protagonist's life.
The Killing of Two Lovers,Agonized silences are interwoven with sharp dialogue and some surprising narrative twists.
The Killing of Two Lovers,A movie with mannered style and character choices that always reminded me it was a movie.
The Killing of Two Lovers,"This lean, bruising exploration of the minefield of an imperiled marriage should put its filmmaker on the map while also elevating the stock of its terrific lead actors, who never hit a false note."
The Killing of Two Lovers,An arresting auteurist miniature...
Blue Jean,"The triumph of Blue Jean is that it takes time showing the queer lives at stake. This is not a dour film. It has hot lesbian sex, sweaty snapshots of queer bars, and, ultimately, portrays the power of community."
Blue Jean,"Aside from its smart writing and grounding in real-world stakes, Blue Jean also has courageous performances. McEwen as Jean is exquisitely torn, giving an impressively internal performance that eventually spills over."
Blue Jean,What I like is how this movie does not got where it might ordinarily have. It walks a more narrow and human path.
Blue Jean,Understated and feels very lived-in.
Blue Jean,"McEwen, who is in almost every scene, is superb. The rest of the cast does excellent work, but this is McEwen’s show all the way."
Blue Jean,Trenchant and sadly still timely.
Blue Jean,Recommended.
Blue Jean,"A confident, moody and superbly acted debut feature from Georgia Oakley."
Blue Jean,"Oakley’s debut astonishes in every way, a silent scream that should be heard and felt today."
Blue Jean,"There are patches of rough air in Blue Jean that cause some narrative bumps. But it also avoids giving you the sort of easy-answer ending that it appears to be setting up, favoring a sort of hard-won honesty over happily ever afters."
Blue Jean,Oakley’s care and McEwen’s intense performance make “Blue Jean” one of this year’s most impressive movies.
Blue Jean,"Featuring a stirring breakout performance from the luminous Rosy McEwan, “Blue Jean” grounds the political with the personal — without losing sight of queer joy."
Blue Jean,"The film’s writer and director, Georgia Oakley, has made an accomplished movie in many ways."
Blue Jean,... A quietly complex portrait of compartmentalization and self-actualization.
Blue Jean,"Blue Jean is a non-judgmental tale of self-acceptance, intergenerational solidarity and sapphic power."
Blue Jean,It’s as persuasive as it is powerful.
Blue Jean,"Jean is a complicated sort of hero, full of indecision and regret. It’s something bracingly captured by McEwen, who plays her as someone in a perpetual state of fight-or-flight."
Blue Jean,Every aspect of Georgia Oakley’s debut feature – from Izabella Curry’s editing to Kirsty Halliday’s period costuming – is as restrained as Rosy McEwen’s excellent performance.
Blue Jean,"In other hands, all of this might have come across as didactic and blandly worthy, but Oakley evokes a strong sense of period with gritty, grainy cinematography that harks back to the look of 1980s British drama..."
Blue Jean,This subject matter demands a more uncompromising approach.
Blue Jean,"Fit to stand alongside My Beautiful Laundrette and Pride, Oakley’s brilliant film offers hope to anyone who doesn’t feel they fit in and are trapped in a hostile environment."
Blue Jean,"It isn’t always subtle, but Blue Jean is a gorgeously presented, stirringly performed slice of British queer history..."
Blue Jean,Blue Jean is most remarkable when it simply observes its main character as she exists in her unmanageable world.
Blue Jean,"The Eighties cues, from SlimFast diets to Blind Date, are cringingly accurate, and the novice director Georgia Oakley has coaxed a powerful, internalised performance from the equally untested McEwen."
Blue Jean,“Blue Jean” is a Thatcher-era period piece that crisply evokes that climate of politically propagated homophobia without preserving it in amber: It effectively puts the past in tacit dialogue with the present.
Blue Jean,"McEwen leads a very effective cast in this poignant personal-political drama, which also happens to have a cracking retro soundtrack."
Blue Jean,"The film sometimes feels something like Russell T Davies with some Prisoner Cell Block H thrown in. But it’s certainly forthright, with some soap-operatic force."
Blue Jean,"Considering the stranglehold transphobia has on British culture currently, Blue Jean feels all the more impactful as a cautionary tale of how this intolerance only breeds hatred and hurt."
Blue Jean,"It’s a remarkably accomplished picture on every level, not least the keenly felt and fiercely authentic performances."
Blue Jean,"Convinces minutely, with every moody needle-drop and stiff drinks-party exchange, as a period piece about terror, ostracisation, and betrayal."
Language Lessons,"Morales' assured direction, and the Zoom meeting conceit, really enhances the material."
Language Lessons,"The odd contrivance here and there can't diminish the potency of this deeply empathetic, entirely platonic rom-com."
Language Lessons,Language Lessons is an alternately comforting and challenging watch ... making plain the winsome appeal of films about platonic love.
Language Lessons,"It's charming, they have incredible chemistry with each other... It's [also] a really inventive way to use the technology to get to the heart of what can be good and what can be bad about [the technology]."
Language Lessons,It's really terrific.
Language Lessons,"A warm, lovely film about platonic affection and the human need for connection."
Language Lessons,A delightfully poignant and intelligently openhearted experience...
Language Lessons,"The harder the movie leans into its own cleverness, the more it exposes itself as a diverting but ultimately unconvincing exercise."
Language Lessons,"If a digitally mediated future is inevitable, we can only hope that it will produce more thoughtful, open-hearted stories like this one."
Language Lessons,"As a performer, Morales is laughably smart, sympathetic, and engaging, and what's so clever about ""Language Lessons"" is the deployment of that allure."
Language Lessons,"The ending is forced but ""Language"" captures the nuances of a complex friendship."
Language Lessons,"The film gets heavy handed about it's premise sometimes, exaggerating the online-ness of it all with artificial glitches and voice modulations, but beyond that Language Lessons is gorgeously, uncomfortably real."
Language Lessons,"This exceedingly modest tale of a Spanish-language instructor and pupil who meet online becomes more genially engaging as it goes along, although it never aims very high other than as a technical experiment that more or less succeeds."
Language Lessons,"Language Lessons reduces me to monosyllables; it is just pure and good and hard and kind and - ultimately - just so, so, so real."
Language Lessons,"Zoom fatigue may be real, but ""Language Lessons"" ventures to show how true connection can come at any time, and through any medium, barriers be damned."
Language Lessons,"Had the film trusted its self-imposed minimalism a little more, it might have been a lot more successful as a character study."
Language Lessons,"Films explicitly about the formation of friendships are rare, and Morales and Duplass have fashioned rather a perceptive one..."
Language Lessons,Slender but sweet.
Carmen,"Natascha McElhone is a wonder in writer-director Valerie Buhagiar’s charming dramedy “Carmen,” a film about a long-overlooked woman who finally comes out of her shell and puts a lifetime of silent observations to use."
Carmen,The final warm embrace of the people who had previously scorned Carmen wraps the film in a feel-good ending that rewards the viewer’s concern for her general welfare and erases the sting of the repressive and patriarchal customs.
Carmen,"In a movie where the central theme is a divorce from orthodoxy, the writer and director Valerie Buhagiar makes the wise decision to orient her film toward what’s pleasurable rather than what’s logical."
Mission Stories,The film can be enjoyed as irrefutable proof of what can be done with this type of proposal when placed in the right hands. [Full review in Spanish]
Mission Stories,This is going to meet all of the expectations.
Mission Stories,"Like a motorcycle leaping off a mountain, this movie has very high highs and very low lows... But as soon as the action started, especially the last action set pieces, I could've rolled right into the sequel immediately."
Mission Stories,"The stunts are enough to make it a good time… They’re not enough to make it a great movie, or even a great Mission: Impossible movie. Like its AI villain, Reckoning may have become too self aware."
Mission Stories,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is absolutely a mixed bag of tricks. The high points are stratospheric, but the low ones are frequently head-scratching."
Mission Stories,"Adrenaline-pumping sequences, flirtatious interludes, high pitch drama and a save-the-world plot do their jobs. However, something about the process doesn’t feel new."
Mission Stories,"Kudos to Cruise for knowing his audience and how to please it. He nails a nearly impossible mission: becoming the summer’s box office savior riding a sequel, again, while performing stunts that would terrify actors half his age."
Mission Stories,"McQuarrie’s lasting contribution is a style of intensely pressurized efficiency. His films push the Mission: Impossible franchise away from espionage melodrama and toward a spectacle of function, of situation and action over emotion and impact."
Mission Stories,"The last 40 minutes of Dead Reckoning Part One make up for the rest, and rank with the most thrilling action sequences I’ve seen this year."
Mission Stories,"The new Mission: Impossible, while not peerless entertainment, is a much better sequel. When not bogged down by unnecessary exposition -- really, who bothers to follow the plot of these movies anyway? -- it's a giddy, globe-spanning thrill ride."
Mission Stories,"The fun comes in the execution. Identities are assumed; masks are worn and revealed; and the question of what is real, what is fake, and what to do with that information creates a steady sense of engagement."
Mission Stories,"Relentlessness of this order ought to be chilling. Not so. Instead, we are stirred and amused by a preternatural sight: men as little machines."
Mission Stories,So what if the plot is the usual tangle to set up the stunts. Tom Cruise does the impossible and nobody does it better.
Mission Stories,McQuarrie makes sure we have enough spatial information to understand where the bad guys and good guys are in relation to each other.
Mission Stories,"“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” ends one mission but leaves us at the beginning of its next one. To my surprise, I found myself choosing to accept it."
Mission Stories,"With a thin plot filled out by half-hour chase sequences, the film is 163 minutes long: even at the press screening, people were checking their phones."
Mission Stories,"If you do give in, you’re in for a treat -- a heart-pounding, never dragging, mission accomplished."
Mission Stories,"For anyone expecting Cruise to slow down, even a little, as he nears AARP eligibility, forget it, as Dead Reckoning features several positively jaw-dropping aerial maneuvers."
Mission Stories,"The chases and stunts are robust, the European locations glamorous and there is an occasional slapstick undertone reminiscent of the Roger Moore James Bond movies."
Mission Stories,"As absurdly, exhilaratingly entertaining as its title is corporate boilerplate."
Mission Stories,The entire film feels jury-rigged as if every action sequence — and there are too few of them — is designed by an algorithm rather than a human. Perhaps the nefarious Entity wrote the lame screenplay?
Mission Stories,"It’s full of sound and fury and Tom Cruise, running, cliffhanging, flying, with periodic rest stops for brooding."
Mission Stories,Brings back some of the magic from DePalma's original (still the best Mission: Impossible) but now with the unrelenting action and scale of the latter movies.
Mission Stories,"Cruise the stuntman is reliably spectacular here, but Cruise the actor seems a bit scattered... And Hunt the character? He fails personally when it counts, but suffers not a single consequence because of it."
Mission Stories,"Amid its terrific action sequences, comedic wit and — somewhere deep within that — heart, the movie is helping to sound a much-needed alarm."
Mission Stories,This film gives us a new and very satisfying level of competent.
Mission Stories,"This most recent installment is funny and genuinely exciting--but not for 2hrs and 43 minutes. Not that running-time is any way to judge a movie, but an audience that has been entertained, and not exhausted, might be happier overall; I know I would."
Mission Stories,"It makes for a fine night out at the movies, perched on the edge of your seat."
Mission Stories,"As always, Cruise’s escalating feats of Evel Knievel daredevilry, which he’s now performing in his 60s, mark him as an analog hero in a world of digital superheroes."
Mission Stories,"This is the third movie in the series that Cruise and the director Christopher McQuarrie have made together, and they have settled into a mutually beneficial groove."
Mission Stories,"What a wonderful world it would be if all supermassive movies were this well executed, this thoughtful, this much fun. But they're not, and that's what renders the ""Mission: Impossible"" series a cut above its competition."
Mission Stories,"Dead Reckoning delivers all of the high-speed, high-altitude, captured-in-camera thrills that fans have come to expect."
Mission Stories,"“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” may not be a great movie, but it’s a special movie deserving of its own kind of event and worth appreciating."
Mission Stories,"With these loving tributes to film history and an uncontrollable digital villain, McQuarrie and Cruise make an impassioned argument for cinema itself, the kind created by humans, shared collectively, in which emotion is integral to spectacle"
Mission Stories,"No narrative, characters or dialogue needed. But at nearly every turn, Dead Reckoning aims for something more than the sum of its Evel Knievel parts."
Mission Stories,"If multi-installment arcs are the future of big-budget, blockbuster productions, the approach favored by McQuarrie and his team could represent a template of how to do it right."
Mission Stories,"For all its action, Dead Reckoning does an admirable job of juggling a myriad of supporting characters."
Mission Stories,"The zeitgeisty plot may have holes through which you could drive the Orient Express, but for pure adrenaline rush entertainment this will leave you exhilarated and eager for more."
Mission Stories,"... Three hours of breathtaking, edge-of-your-seat stunts. Were that its only mission – the have-to-see-it-to-believe-it action scenes – this seventh installment in the MI franchise would score five out of five."
Mission Stories,"A two-hour-plus session of cinematic self-care, wherein the chases, fights, mayhem, exegetical speeches and jaw-dropping derring-do knit together to form a comforting weighted blanket of pure escapism and reassurance."
Mission Stories,"Cruise and Atwell's jokey interplay ensures that M:I7 is bright and likeable, and doesn't feel as long as its two-and-three-quarter-hour running time."
Mission Stories,McQuarrie is dead serious about the wit and care necessary for an escapism that can match our interesting times.
Mission Stories,Few franchises are this well-grooved. Blockbuster escapism doesn’t get much better.
Mission Stories,"""Dead Reckoning"" takes some time to get going...But once it gets cranking, as in a breathless car chase through Rome or on an out-of-control train zooming through a European mountain pass, the dead spots are forgotten."
Mission Stories,"That McQuarrie and Cruise are eventually able to get this hurtling, heavy plane level and pull off a rewarding climax is a testament to the fierceness of their commitment to these projects."
Mission Stories,"This is a worthy entry in America’s best ongoing franchise, one where sincerity and absurdity walk hand in hand with vital, triumphant conviction."
Mission Stories,McQuarrie puts enough bloody crunch into the action to dispel any suggestions of creeping comic decadence. Top-flight supporting performances help.
Mission Stories,“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises.
Mission Stories,"A throwback to an era when “summer movies” represented something distinct from what studios produced for the other nine months of the year, Dead Reckoning offers 163 minutes’ worth of adrenaline and excitement that never overstays its welcome."
Mission Stories,"If you're a fan of this franchise, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One will pull you to the edge of your seat and thrill you down to your bones. That's just science."
Mission Stories,"What better mission could there be this summer other than witnessing our perpetual cinematic maverick deliver yet another full-scale cinematic experience? Should you choose to accept it, of course."
Mission Stories,Dead Reckoning” is a perfectly competent entry in a perfectly competent franchise that has carried on for a lot longer -- the first one came out in 1996 -- than anyone could have predicted.
Mission Stories,"There’s an Easter-eggy quality to much of Dead Reckoning, but McQuarrie & Co. escalate matters effectively."
Mission Stories,"Fallout remains the best in the series, but Tom and his team have done good again. To hell with avatars and deepfakes... reckless and talented thesps still have the power to make us feel alive."
Mission Stories,"It feels like a movie that’s been assembled by an inattentive monkey, or a luckless studio intern who was handed a bucket of half-completed rushes and told, “Go make a Covid-beating blockbuster out of that.”"
Mission Stories,"All that really matters is the showmanship, which keeps thundering along like that out-of-control engine, wheels and pistons screaming but somehow still clinging to their course."
Mission Stories,See it on the biggest screen you can find.
Mission Stories,"If it’s pure action you’re after, there’s plenty to set your heart racing here."
Mission Stories,"Dead Reckoning Part One doesn’t just rack up the miles in style. Like so many globe-trotting thrillers and big-screen tourist brochures, it’s also a gleaming advertisement for Hollywood itself."
Mission Stories,"The result mostly works, but it feels like a franchise that’s winding down. Here’s hoping a few thrills have been saved for “Part Two.”"
Mission Stories,"While the title might feel unwieldy, the film itself is anything but, its nearly three-hour running time passing as quickly as it takes a message to self-destruct."
Mission Stories,"The story exists only as flimsy interstitial tissue between the Tom-centric stunts, but maybe that’s enough. Ostensibly greater movies have given us less."
Mission Stories,"Dead Reckoning Part One is this summer’s best action blockbuster and possibly the best Mission yet – and, yes I do say that every time."
Mission Stories,"If you choose to accept to this “Mission” – and what action-movie fan or Cruise nerd wouldn’t, really – it’s the first half of a man vs. machine epic that doesn’t skimp in the thrills department."
Mission Stories,I reckon “Dead Reckoning” is one of the best movies of our so-far lacking summer.
Mission Stories,"This outrageously enjoyable spectacle has compelled my awestruck assent with its sheer stamina, scale and brio."
Mission Stories,"Dead Reckoning can, admittedly, feel a little too immaculate and calculated when held up against the more lofty, idea-driven blockbusters of our age. But any simplicity here is outweighed by the sheer force of Cruise’s brand."
Mission Stories,"Moves at the speed of sound, with one outrageous, exhilarating set piece after the other."
Mission Stories,"Oh, does Cruise get in his steps over the course of this film, finding new and exciting locations through which to run, which McQuarrie’s cameras capture with just enough of a wink to let the audience know that he *gets* it."
Mission Stories,"Dead Reckoning never rises to [Fallout]'s level, though McQuarrie concocts set pieces and the cast carves out stand-alone moments that stick with you past the credit roll."
Mission Stories,Gives you your money’s worth in the gonzo visuals department.
Mission Stories,"Dead Reckoning Part One is an exhilarating blockbuster, distilling pure spectacle into a two-and-a-half hour feature."
Mission Stories,"The strong cast, high-gloss production values and constant wow factor of the action offer plenty of distraction from the storytelling deficiencies."
Mission Stories,"This one’s an endlessly thrilling, continuously propulsive beast, tense from the start: even the quieter, conversational scenes have you on edge. Mission, once again, accomplished."
Mission Stories,Dead Reckoning Part One may not be the best movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise. but this extravagantly entertaining Dolby soap opera nails what the Mission: Impossible franchise does best.
Mission Stories,"Brimming with confidence and swaggering showmanship, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One further cements this series as a consistently dazzling action franchise."
Mission Stories,"""Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One"" isn’t quite as dynamic as McQuarrie’s preceding ""Fallout,"" but it’s not far off that standout’s pace, and it finds a way to concoct a satisfying resolution to its tale even as it sets up its closing chapter."
Mission Stories,While it can’t eclipse what came before... McQuarrie delivers a formidable concept and several hall-of-fame set-pieces while somehow also managing to tie the storylines back into these movies’ core mythology.
Mission Stories,"This is a serious, sharp-minded and top-tier action film by any standard, and many fans will no doubt mollify themselves by seeing it more than once before Part Two opens a year from now. This is Hollywood action filmmaking at its peak."
Mission Stories,"The action consistently snaps the film into focus, but it further illustrates how badly the decision to split this narrative into two parts throws off its delicate rhythm."
The Souvenir Part II,The Souvenir Part II is undeniably the work of a talented director though this episode of the autobiography is less interesting than its predecessor.
The Souvenir Part II,This is a creative coming-of-age story – a portrait of the artist as a young woman discovering her own voice.
The Souvenir Part II,"Joanna Hogg delivers an object lesson in how to deliver a follow-up: deeper, funnier, more imaginative than its predecessor, The Souvenir Part II is a filmmaker working at the peak of her powers."
The Souvenir Part II,"Think of it as The Godfather Part II of posh misery, a film built upon the emotional wreckage left behind from the original, yet wider in scope, smoother in execution, and with warmth where a freezer used to be."
The Souvenir Part II,"It is painfully touching. You can’t tear your eyes from them. If there were to be The Souvenir Part III: Rosalind and James Walk Their Springer Spaniels, I would be up for that."
The Souvenir Part II,Hogg has created her own universe and explored it with relentless vigour. Few final shots have so satisfactorily summed up such a magnum opus.
The Souvenir Part II,The complete story ends up a valentine to the transformative power of cinema.
The Souvenir Part II,"For the viewer, it feels less necessary, more of a coda... The film is beautifully made, and there are treasurable scenes."
The Souvenir Part II,"Hogg captures something I've felt acutely as a female filmmaker: a desperate need for everyone to like you, which eliminates any possibility of their respect."
The Souvenir Part II,Writer-director Joanna Hogg's artistic choices formulate something that isn't easily explained and is fathomable only in the viewing of it.
The Souvenir Part II,"There's nothing actor-ish or mannered about Byrne. She doesn't even seem to be giving a performance, which underscores just how good a performance it actually is."
The Souvenir Part II,Joanna Hogg's film treat a young artist's coming of age with disarming seriousness.
The Souvenir Part II,"Like the original, the sequel makes the most of the very real mother-daughter dynamic."
The Souvenir Part II,"It's less immediate than the first film, less cumulatively dramatic, but it flourishes in its complexity, in its depiction of the whole of Julie as she tries to focus her loss through her film school graduation project."
The Souvenir Part II,"A delicate, somewhat maddeningly solipsistic portrait of a young artist discovering her voice and learning to fight for it."
The Souvenir Part II,This portrait of the artist as a young woman is rich with detail and mystery and satisfaction...
The Souvenir Part II,It'll leave you breathless.
The Souvenir Part II,"The problem with ""Part II"" is that the film, like Julie, is adrift."
The Souvenir Part II,"It's a specific character study told with the ambition that small, arty projects are rarely afforded -- a complex and deeply realized story that not only demanded a second film but actually got one."
The Souvenir Part II,"For her new film, Hogg goes further, and in so doing makes one of 2021's best movies."
The Souvenir Part II,"A beguilingly meta portrait of the artist as a young woman learning to find herself not just in the mirror of others, but in her own hand behind the camera."
The Souvenir Part II,"The Souvenir Part II is a more buoyant, funnier film than its predecessor."
The Souvenir Part II,"The entire construction of ""The Souvenir: Part II,"" the connection between its drama and Julie's student film, reflects an earnest and principled, if simplistic, didacticism about the pain and the privilege that allow aesthetic pleasure to be created."
The Souvenir Part II,"More than anything, Hogg seems to be seeking a better understanding of the person she was at the time, with the films serving as a mirror that doesn't reverse her image, offering a fresh angle on a familiar reflection..."
The Souvenir Part II,It's the 'almost-by-accident' quality (because of course it's not an accident at all) of Hogg's work that makes it unique.
The Souvenir Part II,"As dazzled as I was by the performances in Part I, I was impatient with the meek, well-bred protagonist...Much of the joy here, in contrast, is in how this once-passive young woman plunges headlong into creative projects, friendships, & romantic dalliances."
The Souvenir Part II,The film gets far more compelling when Julie essentially stages the events of The Souvenir as her thesis short.
The Souvenir Part II,"The best kind of sequel, not merely enhancing or deepening its predecessor but also recasting it in a revelatory new light."
The Souvenir Part II,"Ms. Hogg has outdone herself with an even stronger film about grief, self-discovery, the daunting uncertainties of the creative process and, before and after everything else, the mysterious power of the movie medium."
The Souvenir Part II,"Movies about moviemaking are rarely as interesting as their makers think, but Julie's process does illuminate the character and Hogg's autobiographical intentions."
The Souvenir Part II,"Art and life speedily evolve as one, the possibility of renewal and change demonstrated in practice."
The Souvenir Part II,It's one of the most beautiful and extraordinary films of the year.
The Souvenir Part II,"Searching, leftfield, strange and imaginative -- you could call The Souvenir Part II all those things. It's also sensitive and funny."
The Souvenir Part II,"It's funnier than the original, and looser, too."
The Souvenir Part II,"Joanna Hogg's The Souvenir: Part II is an extremely satisfying sequel to her 1980s-set memoir about a naive young film student falling under the thrall of an oppressive older man, Anthony."
The Souvenir Part II,"Joanna Hogg's film is a work of understated warmth, profound emotional complexity, and eminently British dry humor."
The Souvenir Part II,The Souvenir Part II has a meta-movie component that distinguishes it from its predecessor.
The Souvenir Part II,"In the masterful The Souvenir: Part II [Hogg] continues to sculpt Julie's path with kindness, lovingly allowing her character to confront the paralyzing shadow that grief casts over her."
The Souvenir Part II,"A masterwork of self-introspection through the canvas of cinema, ""The Souvenir: Part II"" is a meta epic of delicate proportions that constantly folds into itself."
The Souvenir Part II,"[T]his A24 release deftly extracts something real and relatable from the elaborate artifice of the filmmaking process, making amusing observations about both the academic and the commercial sides."
The Souvenir Part II,"This second part is lighter, more playful, growing in confidence along with its protagonist, in a terrific performance from Byrne. But it's also full of gentle, cherished acts of memory... A memorable experience, indeed."
The Souvenir Part II,"Joanna Hogg has given us an amazingly luminous self-portrait of the film-maker as a young woman: metatextual, confessional and autobiographical."
The Souvenir Part II,"Evidence of [Hoggs'] intention to own this portrait of the artist as a young, bereaved woman arrives in a perfectly judged finale, where Hogg's own voice has the final word."
The Souvenir Part II,"A mild case of sequelitis has infected the film-maker Joanna Hogg, who follows her devastating and award-winning drama from 2019, The Souvenir, with this rigorously shot, intellectually cogent, but ultimately vacant companion piece."
The Souvenir Part II,This is moving and very evocative filmmaking.
The Souvenir Part II,"It's a beguiling work from a master of her craft that holds the art of filmmaking in its piercing gaze, and speaks to an uncompromising vision of what cinema can be with a little faith and imagination."
The Souvenir Part II,"A film to savour, visually and sensorily."
The Souvenir Part II,"Like ""The Souvenir"" itself (both parts of it), Byrne's performance gains its power from a steady accumulation of small glimmers."
The Souvenir Part II,"Nevertheless, this is a witty, fitfully intriguing sequel that's a good fit for Cannes: Hogg may be the most French director to come out of England."
The Souvenir Part II,"Everything is fine and nothing is right in Joanna Hogg's film, a dazzling, fragile follow-up to her semi-autobiographical coming-of-age stunner from 2019..."
The Moon,"This film undeniably draws inspiration from movies like 'Gravity,' 'Apollo 13,' and 'Interstellar,' but ultimately succeeds in maintaining its own unique flavour."
The Moon,The Moon is one of the cinematic highlights of 2023. This is the film that many expected 2013’s Gravity to be. Not only is this one of the best films of this year it is an absolute masterpiece in the disaster movie genre.
The Moon,"Director Kim makes good use of the combination of vast scale and claustrophobia, fame and isolation."
Small Engine Repair,Small Engine Repair is little more than 103 minutes of a would-be provocation whose only real advantage is that it's ultimately too dopey to be as offensive as it clearly could have been.
Small Engine Repair,"Small Engine Repair is a real American horror story, skillfully shot, perfectly cast and acted, and carrying a sorrowful message that resonates with brutal truth."
Small Engine Repair,"Ultimately, the story still feels unfinished, and Pollono's direction falters in the film's big twist, when it tries to balance horror and humor before its tidy resolution."
Small Engine Repair,"It isn't as impressive as one of Martin McDonagh's works - which it sometimes goes for - but it still has Bernthal, who galvanizes every scene he's in."
Small Engine Repair,"The results, although sporadically arresting, feel awkward, like a child wearing clothing a few sizes too big."
Small Engine Repair,"The last 40 minutes or so constitute a tense exercise in claustrophobic suspense...It's here that ""Small Engine Repair"" may be at its stagiest but it's here where it's also at its best."
Small Engine Repair,"It's a darkly funny, authentic and unforgettable piece of work."
Small Engine Repair,"Pollono's affable drama doesn't say much about its characters' boozy locker talk, but it does hold together well enough thanks to its strong performances and sympathetic characters."
The World to Come,A portrait of two loveless marriages with two absolutely stone-cold men.
The World to Come,"It is a film to remember for its passion - for its belief that those tiny snatches of pleasure are worth holding onto, even if the rest of the world might never believe them even possible."
The World to Come,There's a satisfying literary intelligence at work.
The World to Come,The Gothic thrills are both subtle and properly gut-churning.
The World to Come,It celebrates female desire wrestling to be free of its cage.
The World to Come,"Makes terrific and tactile use of the landscape - rural Romania plays the eastern United States here - with brutal winters, springtime clotheslines, and clandestine woodland encounters."
The World to Come,"Kirby and Waterston show with great actorly skill and zeal two people falling head-over-heels in love at first sight, utterly and passionately."

The World to Come,"Waterston and Kirby give it their all, and their passion on screen is electrifying."
The World to Come,"What stands out is the way that Fastvold's film renders the furtive, the inexpressible, the typically-repressed in primary color. The ties grow between Abigail and Tallie feel unencumbered, afloat with a sense of joyous implausibility."
The World to Come,"The film offers a small bit of emotional rescue at its very end-a graceful tribute to the escapes of memory and fantasy-but by then the dourness of its conclusions has blotted out any rounder sense of meaning. There is not much world to come, after all"
The World to Come,"Waterston and Kirby build a captivating atmosphere of intimacy and tenderness that is as genuine as it is achingly believable. But unfortunately, their talents are almost too big for the story..."
The World to Come,"When in the presence of Kirby's warm and exotic pre-Raphaelite beauty, Waterston smiles with pure delight (at first, it's a jarring sight), relieved in the discovery that life can be more than everyday drudgery and pain."
The World to Come,A love story of deep and delicate feeling if not strict originality.
The World to Come,"Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby are beautiful together in the 19th century, rough-country love story."
The World to Come,"What the film lacks in any real, tangible chemistry between its leads, it makes up for in its excess of violence."
The World to Come,"This is a very damped down, rather straight-laced movie. It's not Portrait of a Lady on Fire, it's sort of Portrait of a Lady Lightly Singed, but it does have some terrific performance in there."
The World to Come,You long for something evocative and warm throughout The World to Come only to leave it with a minor shiver.
The World to Come,"Though admirably sensitive to the inner lives of opened souls, ""The World to Come"" is more a journal with faded photographs than a past made vividly present."
The World to Come,"The World to Come weaves a beguiling spell, told with both restraint and ecstasy."
The World to Come,"Waterston and Kirby are both superb at creating characters whose attraction must be shown to grow by degrees, without overt admission."
The World to Come,"The World To Come is in love with language, constructing palaces of beautiful words that contrast with the muddy, rocky environment surrounding its characters."
The World to Come,Waterston and Kirby do achieve an intimacy that operates as a warm fire warding off the chilliness around them. It's too bad we were left out in the cold.
The World to Come,"Instead of denaturing the ardor - the ecstasy, the rapture, the ultimate tragedy - of the story, Fastvold's light hand only intensifies it."
The World to Come,"The cinematography, the sound design, the direction of the actors - it all culminates in a remarkable cinematic experience. And yet every time Affleck was on-screen, I felt chilled."
The World to Come,"They are porcelain dolls, lovely but cold and stiff as they clink together for a kiss. Stodgy longing makes for an unremarkable romance."
The World to Come,"The principal legacy of ""The World to Come""-unusually, for a costume picture-is a sense of bridled anger, at all that will never be said and done."
The World to Come,"The shaky script is leveled out by the performances of its lead actresses, and Fastvold's intoxicating direction."
The World to Come,"Historical lesbian love stories have become an increasingly prolific genre... and this one doesn't strike much new ground as a romance. But it's haunting as a portrait of a marriage trapped in amber, each partner screaming silently inside themselves."
The World to Come,The film presents a world that too often feels as if it's a product of the present day.
The World to Come,Kirby and Waterston have white-hot chemistry...
The World to Come,Many of the script's most pivotal moments are folded into the margins like the two lines of chicken scratch that gave birth to these characters.
The World to Come,Heartwarming and heartbreaking.
The World to Come,All four of the key performances here are fantastic enough for the film to overcome its flaws.
The World to Come,"This is an austere but lyrical piece underwritten by a complex grasp of emotional and psychological nuance, and a second feature of striking command by Norwegian-born director Mona Fastvold..."
The World to Come,"Much as I admired and was at times stirred by The World to Come, I'm convinced it would be a significantly stronger movie with 75 percent of the narration stripped away."
The World to Come,"It's as simultaneously chilling and warming as a slug of ice-cold vodka, and just as liable to make your mind swim and eyes prick."
The World to Come,"This richly textural sophomore feature represents a considerable step up from [Fastvold's] intriguing but opaque 2014 debut ""The Sleepwalker."""
The World to Come,Fastvold's romance casts a spell.
The World to Come,"Although arranged around a fulfilling, life-changing connection ""The World to Come"" is a deeply lonesome lovesong."
Juniper,Top drawer character based drama with brilliant performances from the entire cast.
Juniper,"At its core, Juniper is a beautifully filmed and excellently acted drama about the pursuit of repairing familial relations, reacquainting oneself with the virtues of living, and learning to accept the inevitable."
Juniper,Juniper has some particularly outstanding individual sequences where characters start in one place and end up in a completely different one after a series of revelations.
Daliland,[A] run-of-the-mill drama... with a level of unoriginality that would surely have appalled Dalí as much as spinach.
Daliland,You won’t learn much about Dali’s work but Kingsley and Sukowa seize the chance to exploit the couple’s flair for theatricality in all its forms.
Daliland,"Ben Kingsley and Barbara Sukowa ham it up as Dalí and Gala, but there is no other way to portray this pair. It is a testament to Harron’s skill that she’s able to make these despicable and delusional monsters sympathetic..."
Daliland,You're expecting more visual wonder than this has... It just feels dull.
Daliland,"Further proof, if you need it, of how hard it is to make a good film about a great artist – or even Salvador Dalí."
Daliland,The movie’s commonplaces don’t serve its singular subject—love him or hate him—all that well.
Daliland,"The power of Kingsley’s performance is more than a matter of his own precise and expansive artistry; it’s a matter of a shrewd script, by John Walsh, and of Harron’s fervent attention to its essence."
Daliland,"Somewhere in “Dalíland” is a far sharper film about this unusual pair... But through James’ point of view, it’s just another coming-of-age tale for a young white man who finds himself tickled and intrigued by this seeming den of artistic iniquity."
Daliland,Sinfully fun feature.
Daliland,"The thoroughly unengaging film is a remarkable achievement, but only considering the misspent potential of its juicy source material."
Daliland,"Harron’s result is less a consummate portrait and more a distillation of a sensibility, as if she had dropped Dalí in an alcohol still to extract his very essence."
Daliland,The cumulative effect of all the movie’s moments add up to a satisfying portrait.
Daliland,The film renders Salvador Dalí’s final years with a self-negating blend of pity and devotion.
Daliland,"On paper, Dalíland has all the elements of a fascinating character study. In practice, it’s more of a rote exercise."
Daliland,"It’s based on historical facts and real-life characters, yet it feels timeless and allegorical."
Daliland,"Unfortunately, although James allows the audience a surrogate into the wild world in which Dalí and Gala live, he doesn’t prove to be all that interesting as an observer, nor does Christopher Briney prove himself a compelling leading man."
Daliland,"Mary Harron is too good a director to make a drab, conventional biopic, so it’s disappointing to report that with “Dalíland,” she’s done just that."
Daliland,"The latest of the director's splendidly offbeat biopics captures the madness, the comedy and the tragedy of the surrealist legend who turned his very identity into a work of art."
Daliland,Entertaining and genuinely eye-opening.
Swan Song,The agony and ecstasy of ballet is blisteringly captured in this stunning documentary.
Swan Song,"With outstanding visuals and gorgeous production, by the time the final curtain falls, it is impossible not to have a deeper appreciation and love of ballet."
Swan Song,"Kain’s reputation is on the line here after a lifetime devoted to ballet, which makes Swan Song an artfully anxiety-inducing backstage drama."
Swan Song,"Kain’s accomplishments as a dancer notwithstanding, the film successfully contends that her true legacy lies in the contributions she’s made to ensure that the ballet world she leaves behind is better than the one she entered."
Mass,"It may be a tough watch, but, boasting a quartet of excellent performances, Fran Kranz's directorial debut is a technically adept, emotionally exhausting yet deeply cathartic film that couldn't be more timely."
Mass,"While stories such as We Need To Talk about Kevin capitalised on the shock value of its horrifying events by playing with a non-linear narrative, Kranz's film doesn't feel the need for any extra artifice."
Mass,Movies trade in closure. Mass is honest enough to admit it is not always there to be had.
Mass,"We see not one glimpse of the calamity that's blighted these lives, but in the eyes and faces of the four actors, we see it all."
Mass,"Mass is a wonderfully acted, if claustrophobic, ordeal of emotional pain."
Mass,"The performances are too internalized to seem theatrical. Often, ""Mass"" is most moving when they're simply listening."
Mass,"Isaacs, Plimpton, Birney and Dowd make a strong argument for an Academy-recognized award for ensemble acting."
Mass,"All four members of the primary ensemble deliver empathic and powerful performances, with Plimpton's Gail nearly paralyzed by years of mourning, Isaac's Jay brimming with anger..."
Mass,"Actor Fran Kranz' writing and directing debut makes for an uncomfortable, often tortuous film."
Mass,"At its core, ""Mass"" exerts the power of ritual at its most reflective and galvanizing, reveling in human connection at its most arduous, persistent and sublime."
Mass,"Thoughtful and harrowing, Mass is a difficult wonder."
Mass,"Some horrors must be faced. ""Mass"" faces them head-on, and is all the better for it."
Mass,"Kranz can't quite figure out a way to make his characters' collective misery cinematically interesting. This is a serious movie, but not a searing one."
Mass,Mass's unusual approach -- to consider how people communicate with one another -- results in the rare dramatization of a school shooting's lasting effects that feels truthful without being exploitative.
Mass,"The dedication to unpleasant and probably unknowable reality here can only be admired, whether we like it or not."
Mass,"An out-of-nowhere triumph, Mass is the sort of American drama that you rarely see anymore."
Mass,"Harrowing to watch, but impossible to shake, this emotional powerhouse catches two sets of parents, brilliantly played by Martha Plimpton, Jason Isaacs, Reed Birney and an Oscar-worthy Ann Dowd, in the traumatic aftermath of a school shooting."
Mass,"""Mass"" doesn't impose any meaning, it simply observes the searching for it, and the infinitesimally small salvations we can hope to find in the process."
Mass,"This is, among other things, a vividly eloquent movie about the futility of language, its inability to represent the full scope of our intentions and experiences, much less exorcise our deepest pains."
Mass,It demonstrates the effectiveness of simplicity. A well-written script and an exemplary cast can still produce a movie worth watching.
Mass,A film of rare ideas and smashing performances.
Mass,"Driven by four challenging, nuanced and completely distinct performances, Mass is an emotional razor-wire."
Mass,"The cast carries the film; Dowd, as Linda, is especially terrific. Yet the feeling that one is watching a latter-day teleplay is hard to shake..."
Mass,"In the hands of its cast, the film gives such precise and profound expression to the totality of grief that it comes to feel downright palpable."
Mass,"Special effects and exotic vistas are all very well, but sometimes it can be even more electrifying to see four actors having a quiet conversation in a small room."
Mass,"Taking two pairs of seasoned stage and film actors and putting them in a room for two hours to hash out a shared trauma sounds like the making of a great Tennessee Williams play, but it is instead a riveting and unforgettable feature by Fran Kranz."
Mass,"Mass leaves plenty of breathing room for characters to have authentic moments of emotion and puts a gentle, grace-filled frame around an almost unspeakable tragedy. It's a showcase for its performers, but it's also a valuable experience for its audience."
Mass,"This is such a cagey, engrossing way to start a story."
Mass,"The film avoids leaning into sensationalism, and though it's emotionally wrenching, there's something comforting to the process of mourning that both couples are going through as they wrestle with the political implications of a very personal event."
Mass,"As the audience, being the fifth silent figure in the room is exhausting because you feel for ever single one of them. Yet it is also a story of grace, perfectly told and etched into every understated frame."
Mass,The film beautifully expresses humanity's best aspects - our capacity to forgive and connect with the most unlikely of people.
Mass,"An urgent and necessary movie, if not at all an easy one - and an exceptional opportunity too to watch four great character actors, finally called up from the sidelines to center stage, do what they do."
Mass,"It's a study of human pain and anger in painstaking detail, supported by a script which is hauntingly realistic without dipping into mawkish or exploitative territory."
Mass,An experiment in real-time drama that dissipates in its intensity and power just as it's getting through its emotional climaxes.
Mass,An extraordinarily depressing chamber piece dealing with the long-after fallout of a school shooting.
Mass,"""Mass"" gives each member of the ensemble cast a big speech to emote and express what their characters are feeling. The conversation is certainly compelling as it builds."
Mass,The movie announces Fran Kranz as a bold new filmmaker who has earned the right to excavate a subject as sensitive as this one.
Mass,"Actor-turned-filmmaker Fran Kranz's choice of subject matter for his feature debut is certainly timely and provocative, but the emotions are too big and too messily human to fit into the tight box he has constructed to contain them."
Mass,"Kranz's direction may not be flashy enough to earn him a spot on Marvel's shortlist, but the careful balance that he strikes between the movie's four lead performances reflects a natural confidence behind the camera."
Mass,"With rigour and clarity of purpose, actor/director Fran Kranz holds the audience in his hands, probing at the unthinkable and daring to keep the faith."
Mass,Mass may not be a particularly enjoyable experience but it's a strikingly effective one.
Mass,"It's a harrowing watch, but a cathartic one, with each of the four superb principal actors delivering scenes of wrenching release."
Bergman Island,For once the film-within-a-film is more interesting than the film that frames it. It's like a puzzle box showing you the characters' inner lives.
Bergman Island,"Nothing much else happens in the film, which never really justifies its setting, save as a postcard-pretty destination. Whither the rending of garments? Did anyone actually see a Bergman film?"
Bergman Island,A meditation that muses on many matters.
Bergman Island,"Just missing out on top-tier Hansen-Løve, Bergman Island is beautifully played — especially by Krieps and Wasikowska — and retains all the hallmarks of her best work; an intelligent, personal, heartfelt treat."
Bergman Island,"Good in parts, but you get to the end of two hours and wonder what the film was trying to say. Or at least, I did!"
Bergman Island,"With the “Bergman safari” and its competitive cineastes staking personal claims to the great man’s work, Hansen-Løve gently pokes fun at the reverence for an overbearing auteur, and instead allows her women to drive the story."
Bergman Island,"A meandering, literary, dreamy, inconclusive take on I’m-not-sure-what. It’s not wholly unbeguiling. You won’t wish you were dead like, say, God. But it is densely and tiringly meta."
Bergman Island,"Slight as the movie is (and it is), it is also bold."
Bergman Island,"Bergman Island could so easily have been insufferably self-regarding. Instead, it’s delightful and persuasive in the way it shows where fiction comes from, how it can illuminate more than the facts can, and even offer emancipation from them."
Bergman Island,A valuable if slightly passionless and reticent movie.
Bergman Island,A meditation on modern relationships that hilariously deconstructs the canonisation of Ingmar Bergman.
Bergman Island,"The film could almost have been titled Scenes from a Marriage, in reference to another of the great director’s finest achievements."
Bergman Island,Both Wasikowska and Krieps respond with full heart to their roles. Can’t ask for more than that.
Bergman Island,That the film manages to attain vast levels of emotional resonance speaks to Hansen-Løve's talent for mining her characters' quiet lives for all they're worth.
Bergman Island,"Mia Hansen-Løve's beguiling new film about love, cinema, and Ingmar Bergman oscillates gently between fantasy and realism."
Bergman Island,"Among the virtues of ""Bergman Island"" is how uncluttered it is generally, as well as its consistent quietude and Hansen-Løve's keenness of observation."
Bergman Island,"You don't actually have to love Ingmar Bergman, or even have seen a Bergman movie, to find Bergman Island terrific. Thoughtful, layered, deceptively light, it's among Hansen-Løve's best work."
Bergman Island,"[Mia] Hansen-Løve goes beyond any gossip, delivering a witty, warm commentary on the creative process and the dynamics of relationships where both partners are artists."
Bergman Island,"I liked the way [Vicky Krieps' character] ponders artistry,."
Bergman Island,It's all a bit tenuous. Tim Roth doesn't really give a performance... But it's intriguing despite all that.
Bergman Island,One thing is for sure: Director Mia Hansen-Løve is having quite a bit of fun.
Bergman Island,"Hansen-Løve twists things into a circular pretzel during the climax, and I loved seeing how all her seemingly disconnected themes and plot strands suddenly came together with such rhapsodic ease."
Bergman Island,"Bergman Island gloriously captures the messy collision of love and creativity, and the ways women weave family life and personal obsession into the artistic struggle, reinterpreting the greats, like Bergman."
Bergman Island,"Movies about artists trying to make art might be deadly, but movies about people living are where it's at. And in the end, there's more living than writing going on in Bergman Island."
Bergman Island,Quietly splendid...
Bergman Island,"Yet, for all the interesting ideas, Bergman Island (like Fårö itself) is surprisingly small; and, like Chris' process, it's deliberately vague and almost passively self-contemplative. It's not frustrating, but then, it's not quite that engaging."
Bergman Island,Charmingly mischievous and quietly entrancing...
Bergman Island,"Mia Hansen-Løve, an actress (Les Destinées) turned writer/director (Eden), creates a magical atmosphere."
Bergman Island,"This ingenious and beautiful film by Mia Hansen-Løve isn't for chewing so much as savoring. The more you think back on its mysteries, the more pleasure it bestows."
Bergman Island,"It's a movie that isn't quite sure whether it wants to be one, or which one it wants to be. Which makes it feel like more than just a movie."
Bergman Island,A gentle-toned and multi-layered relationship drama that weaves past and present while reflecting on the thorny dynamic of artists living under the same roof.
Bergman Island,All of it is playfully told and with a master's touch.
Bergman Island,"In its strongest, most evocative scenes, Bergman Island feels like peering in someone else's window, sensing an echo of your own experiences, and marveling at all the ways a stranger could remind you of yourself."
Bergman Island,"""Bergman Island"" is a compelling, enchanting film that works both as a relationship drama and as a conversation between one generation of directors and another."
Bergman Island,French arthouse darling Mia Hansen-Love makes her English-language debut with this seductive meta-drama about the perils of personal film-making.
Bergman Island,"Hansen-Løve is one of the keenest observers of friendship and intimacy, and Bergman Island is no exception, sensitively portraying a relationship that has burned down to its last embers."
Bergman Island,It's less an example of art-imitates-life than a meditation on the endlessly multifaceted relationship between the two-a drama set in a hall of mirrors.
Bergman Island,"[Bergman Island] is a searching exploration of reality and art in the way they mirror, propel and feed on one another, washing ashore remembrances both dreamy and lifelike."
Bergman Island,Incredibly well-observed and surprising...
Bergman Island,"""Bergman Island"" is a heart-stoppingly poignant stunner."
Bergman Island,"Any frustration is neutralized whenever Krieps is onscreen. The actress plays Chris as beguilingly childlike, her feelings and impulses... right at the surface, intensifying and subsiding, arpeggio-like."
Bergman Island,"Wasikowska and Danielsen Lie deliver extraordinarily layered performances, channelling the familiarity of people who have already lived a major story together, along with the painful knowledge that this story is done."
Bergman Island,"A self-reflexive Russian nesting doll-like mix of story in story in story, commenting on itself while throwing plenty of manna to the cinephile masses."
Bergman Island,"Lazy, unimaginative and incapable of expressing admiration for Bergman in any meaningful way, this story of a couple who make a pilgrimage to Faro Island to soak in the man's influence, is a very poor excuse for an homage except as a travelogue."
Bergman Island,"A delicate, haunting little Russian doll of a movie."
Bergman Island,Absolutely nothing of any consequence happens in the director's first Cannes Competition title. And then it happens twice.
Bergman Island,"Krieps, who's phenomenal, has such a natural, lived-in rapport with Roth - the actor doing his best work in years here - that you start to feel the undercurrents in their relationship moving like water round your toes."
Bergman Island,"There's a good film inside Bergman Island, and it's a movie that Bergman fans wouldn't want to go anywhere near."
Bergman Island,"It's a film made with honesty, integrity and a certain grace, but it can't quite overcome an earnestness that was never a problem in Hansen-Love's best films, which carried their literary and cinematic inspirations lightly."
Bergman Island,Lyrical and absorbing...
Bergman Island,"The film never sacrifices its ambiguity as it brings various threads about ghosts, relationships, art, and gender to a head."
Winter Kills,"“Winter Kills” is, above all, an exercise in tone—a crazed, hectic tone that instantly suggests a world irreparably out of whack. What lends the movie substance is the cinematic style that Richert crafts from its dramatic premise."
Winter Kills,It seems to have grown even bolder with age in its willingness to take on sacred cows in the craziest manner imaginable.
Winter Kills,The history of Winter Kills is nearly as lurid and tangled as the conspiracy it depicts.
Winter Kills,"Richert gives the film a hard, bright surface -- this is not a seductive fantasy, it's more of the sarcastic, take-it-or-leave-it kind."
Winter Kills,"Huston gives a powerhouse performance, and Bridges, always likeable, runs through his repertoire of facial expressions and grimaces, but it's a lost cause."
Winter Kills,"Winter Kills"" isn't exactly a comedy, but it's funny. And it isn't exactly serious, but it takes on the serious business of the Kennedy assassination."
Winter Kills,"The film is funny, but it's frightening and vertiginous, too -- a complex tone that apparently left audiences baffled."
I Heard the Bells,"The target audience for this faith-based biopic can't argue about the poet's belief in Jesus as a source of goodness and salvation, even if the film's slow pace left some naysayers."
I Heard the Bells,This is how you do faith based films right. Well done
I Heard the Bells,"An elegantly-mounted production with significant appeal for people seeking an inspirational story of faith this, or any, holiday season."
Wolf,"Despite the impressive performance at its heart, Wolf's off-putting approach still keeps its audience at a remove."
Wolf,"George MacKay, Lily-Rose Depp star in dark fairy tale that handles a real-life condition - believing you're not human - with sensitivity and empathy."
Wolf,George MacKay's presence and physicality is perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of the film.
Wolf,"But for as much writer/director Biancheri pumps copious ideas into this concept, the solemn tone and lack of thematic focus renders the overwrought outing underwhelming."
Wolf,"What started with a sympathetic gaze promising complexity ultimately succumbs to the messiness of mixed tones and shallow observations, a call of the wild reduced to some tinny, ignorable whimpers."
Wolf,"As the film invites us to ponder the real-world circumstances that it implies, its self-seriousness becomes a double-edged sword."
Wolf,"Bichancheri should be commended for being genre defiant while MacKay should be awarded for his performance, but this is by no means for all tastes."
Wolf,The movie as a whole doesn't work.
Wolf,"From Kafka to Kipling, there's plenty of potential in the subject of species dysphoria, but Biancheri hasn't really figured out how to tap into it."
Wolf,"""Wolf"" gives us lots to think about. Too much, in fact, because writer/director Nathalie Biancheri can't figure out how to shape the ideas her story suggests."
Wolf,"Biancheri's imagery is consistently evocative, and her interest in how captivity affects dignity at times recalls the work of Yorgos Lanthimos."
Wolf,"A questioning of identity within societal constraints, of what it takes to fit in, and asking at what point one rejects the limits of normal because it's impossible to comply."
Wolf,"Sometimes Wolf is slight, relying on mystery and metaphor to build suspense, but Biancheri's sense of narrative adventure imbues this survivalist picture with more than uneasiness. She gives it tenderness."
Wolf,"True to its name, ""Wolf"" is a howler."
Wolf,"More an extreme theatre-school exercise than a substantive act of filmmaking, the new drama Wolf is one wild, rabid mess."
Wolf,"If it's an allegory, it trivializes whatever it's allegorizing."
Wolf,Wolf is so thin that one can't help but look right through it.
Wolf,"Wolf certainly won't be for all tastes, but adventurous filmgoers will find much to appreciate."
Wolf,The film easily could have fallen into cheap camp otherwise. It doesn't. MacKay and Depp make it easy to buy into the premise without judgment.
Wolf,"Despite some initial hurdles, the odd flirtation with humor, and some overwrought moments, MacKay sells Jacob utterly."
Heaven,ERROR
Beans,It makes for ideal viewing during Native American Heritage Month. But parents should be made aware it deals frankly with a variety of issues.
Beans,"To Deer's credit, she does not back down from the cruelty that older, white people demonstrate toward the community, including children. (Archival footage of the real incident more than backs up Deer's portrayal.)"
Beans,"It's not hard not to feel that an even more resonant film would go deeper into what's underneath these various landmarks of maturity and identity, instead of predominantly just pointing them out."
Beans,"This is the first fictional film directed by the documentarian Tracey Deer, and she brings a good eye for which characters might make a compelling story."
Beans,"""Beans"" is a thoughtful, stirring reflection by someone who survived it all, quietly demanding acknowledgement not just of her land, but of her life."
Beans,"If rendering their stories artfully through a camera lens opens just one mind, then ""Beans"" is already an unmitigated triumph."
Beans,An affecting personal spin on recent history.
Beans,"An accessible, unsanitized drama foregrounding Indigenous experience - one that doesn't hedge on depicting embedded Québécois racism and discrimination - [director Tracey Deer] is staking out a fertile patch of filmmaking terrain."
Beans,Deer's Beans exults as a sweet debut for both her and Kiawentiio.
Beans,"When Beans works, it resonates. And when it doesn't, it's not a tragedy - merely evidence of a filmmaker finding what works for her voice and vision, and what might work better for a highly anticipated follow-up."
Beans,[T]he projection of universal experiences onto this very specific backdrop has a poignancy all its own.
Limbo,"Fiercely political and starkly beautiful in a way that has become Ivan Sen’s signature, Limbo only further consolidates his position as one of Australia’s most important contemporary filmmakers."
Limbo,"Limbo uses as its catalyst an event that’s both tragically familiar and catastrophically disruptive. It then portrays the aftermath with sensitivity, compassion and a restraint that enhances its impact."
Limbo,"Limbo is a great role for Simon Baker’s creative renaissance, tapping into his thoughtful, quiet energy, his ability to show you a lot without telling you much. And Ivan Sen’s sensibilities for the same makes this a great marriage of actor and director."
Limbo,A quiet but powerful meditation on how far we have not come in this country.
Limbo,"Limbo is perhaps his best film to date, a technically accomplished, richly evocative drama that explores, with the eye of an insider, the often tense relationships between Indigenous Australians and white Australians..."
Limbo,An eerily meditative production with top-notch performances and a harshly beautiful monochrome veneer.
Limbo,"It’s a distinctive work, both visually – the stark black and white photography accentuates the uncanny, almost lunar pockmarks on this scarred terrain – and in terms of its intriguingly detached outback noir storytelling."
Limbo,"This is outback noir — oblique, secretive and as hard-boiled as the ground is hard-baked — and Sen wears it well."
Limbo,"A riveting, multilayered genre piece."
Limbo,"It is a tough, muscular film with the grit of crime, but a heartbeat of compassion."
Supernova,"his is an intense, intimate, spare film about love, grief and dementia, and the two leads, who play a gay couple, are superb."
Supernova,"The film has plenty of low-key charm and humour, not least in Sam and Tusker's believable, tetchy in-car interactions."
Supernova,"Firth and Tucci's performances are remarkable in how delicately they navigate this maze of half-truths and suppressed emotions, all crammed inside their rusty campervan."
Supernova,"A terrific piece of writing about the difficulties of living on the fringes of a catastrophe - acknowledging the danger, but rarely addressing the true terrors that await."
Supernova,"The real impact of the film, however, comes from the leads' performances."
Supernova,"Some directors go an entire career without making anything decent -- whereas Macqueen has directed half a good film, and shaped dauntless performances from Firth and Tucci, on only his second go."
Supernova,"What it lacks in cinematic width it gains in well-earned emotional depth, courtesy of delicate writing and two subtle but towering performances from Firth and Tucci."
Supernova,Supernova is a brave and touching film.
Supernova,The climactic two-hander gifts us some of Firth and Tucci's finest work on screen.
Supernova,Macqueen's script smartly identifies that it's as much Tusker looking after Sam as the other way around. It's one of the relatable truths in a film full of them.
Supernova,"Intimacy and familiarity is difficult to pull off but essential to a love story that's not about the heady first throes of romance but the enduring grace of the last. It's the spark in Supernova, a quiet and poignant drama about saying goodbye."
Supernova,"Macqueen was fortunate to have two really fine actors to play these all-too-human characters. Firth as the introverted, quietly determined Sam has probably never been better, while Tucci also gives a career-best performance..."
Supernova,"Too polite? A few of the film's detractors have said so, and maybe they're right. But more important than this is Macqueen's success in avoiding any taint of sentimentality."
Supernova,You're living in these moments with these characters...the most naturalistic set of performances we've seen in a while.
Supernova,"The film accordingly owes a great deal of its power to its actors, who are, of course, more than merely plausible as longtime partners, whose way through the small dramas of the everyday is the movie's real substance."
Supernova,"By the time Tusker and Sam reach the end of the road - both metaphorical and literal, as this is as much a travelogue of England's Lake District - Supernova feels less like a film to cherish and more a tweet to favourite."
Supernova,Its particular effectiveness depends not only on Firth and Tucci's believability as a couple but also on the complementarity of their respective personas...
Supernova,"Never does ""Supernova"" try to bite off more than it can handle as it winds toward an inevitable but beautifully rendered destination."
Supernova,"In scene after scene, as the two men visit friends and family one last time, we glimpse the showier, more maudlin film that Supernova could but never does devolve into, hovering just at the edges."
Supernova,"If the two performances are individually excellent, it is the relationship between them that is the real star of Supernova, a portrait of the dazzling starburst of intense feeling that floods a deeply loving couple's universe right before heat death."
Supernova,A very touching movie.
Supernova,"Supernova is a moving look at the emotional toll that dementia can have on the powerless sufferer and their selfless caretaker, revealing that one can never have too much time with their loved ones."
Supernova,Supernova annihilated me.
Supernova,The melancholy pleasures of Supernova are entirely derived from getting to watch Firth and Tucci onscreen...
Supernova,"Supernova is by any measure a modest production, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do: Creating a touching, low-key showcase for its stars, one that allows them to cast a bright light."
Supernova,"A delicate, beautifully understated dance of emotions that is so much more than just watching someone in terminal decline. It's also a celebration of a life well lived on its own terms."
Supernova,"With these two actors in command, Supernova doesn't just dare to speak the name of a love between two deeply committed men facing an untenable situation. It shouts it from the rooftops."
Supernova,There's so much truth and compassion embedded in this entire production that the places in which it stumbles can be forgiven.
Supernova,"Generous, lived-in performances bring finer layers to what is at heart an old-fashioned and otherwise surprisingly conventional melodrama about love and loss."
Supernova,"Credit is due to Dick Pope, the cinematographer, who toughens the film and somehow prevents the fabled grandeur of the locations from softening into the pretty."
Supernova,"It's grounded in a way that keeps it earthbound, and in this case, that's better than shooting for the stars."
Supernova,"Macqueen approaches the messy reality of letting go with measured sorrow, unrestrained tenderness, and even moments of joy."
Supernova,"""Supernova"" doesn't bother with many questions, but to its credit, it doesn't pretend to have all the answers."
Supernova,"Stanley Tucci plays a man showing signs of dementia, Colin Firth is his devoted companion, and both are superb."
Supernova,"It's abstractly tragic, about a vague idea of something rather than anything or anyone specific. Dementia is scary and sad. That's about as particular as Supernova gets."
Supernova,"Deserves some credit for not milking easy tears. Unfortunately, it doesn't milk difficult ones, either."
Supernova,"""Supernova"" is a deliberate, rhythm-of-life kind of movie, one that takes its time with mood and character."
Supernova,"As performers, Tucci and Firth embody the best kind of masculinity, which has been missing from popular culture for so long that we've forgotten what it looks like."
Supernova,"It's a tiny story of two men that somehow adds up to all of us, like stardust."
Supernova,"Tucci and Firth have never been better than they are here, and they earn every superlative that has been laid on them in early reviews."
Supernova,"Movies about the decay of the human mind can sometimes be unrelenting, or worse, sentimental, but ""Supernova"" is spare and understated. It manages to be an actors' showcase that isn't showy."
Supernova,"Supernova is modest in every respect except its emotional impact. In the characters' internal arcs, the title-the name for a stellar explosion-comes fully into perspective."
Supernova,Supernova is so obviously structured that it often seems to be imposing meaning on its characters.
Supernova,"This is a heartfelt and engaging story about love, sacrifice and what it means to envisage life without a loved one."
Supernova,"Without entering into spoiler territory, Tusker decides on a plan of action that feels more familiar than it should. But you need to see this movie. Just be aware that the script's not as stellar as the leading men."
Supernova,"Each telling moment, whether big or small, connects unerringly. Its stardust finds us, and every particle feels like one of our own."
Supernova,A sincere and affecting portrait of two people stoically accepting mortality.
Supernova,"Supernova is a serious endeavour, and a solemn, sad-hearted one."
Supernova,"Plenty to admire here, if only this tasteful tearjerker lived up to its title with a few more explosive fireworks instead of settling for timid twinkles, ending not with a bang but a whimper."
Supernova,"""Supernova"" enriches our love for its stars, and announces Macqueen as a talent to invest in, but it's no preening showcase piece: Whatever warmth it leaves you with is rightly undercut with a plunging, unshakeable streak of sorrow."
A Mouthful of Air,The film needed less sensitive good taste and more explicit storytelling passion.
A Mouthful of Air,"For a film so grounded in a real-life issue, the movie doesn't work to make its characters feel human or its world feel real, blunting the emotional impact it could have had."
A Mouthful of Air,"Amanda Seyfried is heartbreaking in A Mouthful of Air, a harrowing story about postpartum depression..."
A Mouthful of Air,"The film is too haunted by helplessness to risk feeling didactic, but this is unambiguously a message movie, and the message is that you can't argue with brain chemistry."
A Mouthful of Air,"""A Mouthful of Air"" aspires to show how depression can sully even the loveliest of scenes. The scenes the movie chooses, however, play like a parody of white privilege..."
A Mouthful of Air,Seyfried's performance is a revelation.
A Mouthful of Air,"It often seems like vital narrative pieces of ""A Mouthful of Air"" have been left on the cutting-room floor, and the result is a frustrating insubstantiality that's exacerbated by the story's lack of forward momentum."
A Mouthful of Air,"Adapting her own 2003 novel, Koppleman keeps things grounded, spare and refreshingly small-scale."
A Mouthful of Air,"This distractingly tidy character study hints at, but never really digs into, the social isolation and emotional instability that keeps an anxious children's book author stuck in her head and apart from her loved ones after she tries to hurt herself."
American Skin,"A smart move to get Spike Lee involved as a producer, as it's right in his wheelhouse...we should really be paying attention to this issue."
American Skin,"American Skin is worth seeing, for the issues Parker seeks to address, even if it only partially works in leaving a mark."
American Skin,"Instead of lending immediacy, the padded-out documentary conceit only spotlights the stiltedness, and Parker falls short of building credible drama out of urgent issues."
American Skin,"Infuriatingly manipulative and insufferably preachy, ""American Skin"" examines the cultural issues tearing apart our nation and reduces them to cheap theatrics."
American Skin,"""American Skin"" is a jagged symphony of false notes, each one struck with a sledgehammer."
American Skin,A self-serving call to action that tries to hide its basic incompetence behind a veil of righteous fury.
American Skin,"So clotted, so strident and so thickly cloaked in self-pity that its impassioned story risks becoming worryingly self-serving."
American Skin,The film becomes a series of familiar character types all getting their turn to talk.
American Skin,"It's a good movie: tense, bold, angry, empathetic, provocative, observant, morally engaged. And also, to be honest, a trifle gimmicky. Yet that's tied to its power as a racially charged, socially urgent gut-punch drama."
American Skin,"A clunky, heavy-handed film that takes a pressing contemporary issue and flattens it under two genres the writer-director seems ill-equipped to handle - the mockumentary and the courtroom drama."
The Unknown Country,"Inside [Tana]'s making a parallel set of discoveries, as does the cinematic reverie we’re watching."
The Unknown Country,Morrisa Maltz’s debut narrative feature deftly mixes in documentary-style sketches...
The Unknown Country,"Maltz’s work is about finding small, great things we’d likely overlook — if we knew where to go looking for them at all."
The Unknown Country,"The Unknown Country may be more a feeling than a movie, but that’s more than satisfactory. Attentive and artful, Maltz is a talent to watch, and in Gladstone, she’s fortunate enough to have a star whose presence binds us to all this soulful roaming."
The Unknown Country,"""The Unknown Country"" shows us what we're missing."
The Unknown Country,"Andrew Hajek’s patiently roving lensing isn’t averse to the odd enraptured magic-hour vista, but binds the film’s various modes and methods in a common, sandy-hued visual language."
The Unknown Country,"A memorable, heart-expanding journey."
The Unknown Country,The film’s gentle detours into the real-life stories remind us that it is the people met on the road that so often make the trip memorable.
The Unknown Country,Experimentally fascinating.
The Unknown Country,"Make no mistake: it’s worth the watch, if even just for Jazzy and Flo."
The Unknown Country,"Despite great performances, The Unknown Country’s real life subjects are so eccentric, they sometimes overshadow the actors. But perhaps that’s the point: truth is stranger than fiction."
The Unknown Country,"Puts us in the presence of a major talent, bearing something profound in her artistic inclinations."
The Unknown Country,The Unknown Country is a poetically whispered dreamscape where self and place collide on a seemingly never ending highway.
The Water Man,"Heartfelt, but overwrought and overplayed throughout."
The Water Man,There's such a winning earnestness to it that I think [director David Oyelowo] comes by honestly.
The Water Man,"The Water Man feels a little watered-down even by the standards of its genre, with somewhat less heft than the old Hallmark Hall of Fame movies, which created a classy environment to sell greeting cards woven into the drama."
The Water Man,The well-executed components support the fairy tale when the tale itself runs short.
The Water Man,"""The Water Man"" is a sensitive coming of age story about loss, friendship and the need to believe in magic, and Oyelowo proves himself to be a gifted storyteller with a big imagination."
The Water Man,"The end result, ""The Water Man,"" while not altogether graceless, registers as tonally disjointed and ultimately inconsequential in spite of its star-fronted cast."
The Water Man,"This family-friendly monster movie will delight kids, move adults..."
The Water Man,"Children absorb everything, good and bad, all the stresses, heartbreak, anxiety of the adults around them. Children can handle the difficult things. Oyelowo knows this and respects it."
The Water Man,"Actor David Oyelowo makes a heartfelt directing debut in a PG adventure about a boy (Lonnie Chavez) in search of a mythic creature who might save his dying mother. Even when the pace drags, the film is a gift for family audiences."
The Water Man,Exquisitely captures the liminal moment at the end of childhood when we are old enough understand some of the complications of life but young enough to believe in magic.
The Water Man,A very nice movie that's a lot like a bunch of other very nice movies.
The Water Man,"The Water Man plays with the conventions of fantasy, as Chavis' perfectly wide-eyed Gunner is taken on a strange, winding path by Miller's suitably roguish and spiky Jo."
The Water Man,"There's a lot of heart, even soul, to this never-overwrought production from Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Films."
The Water Man,"The keen affinity the actor David Oyelowo has for his fellow performers is the best thing about ""The Water Man,"" his feature directorial debut."
The Water Man,"The actor's directorial career is certainly off to a clean-lined, competent start. But it's hard to shake the feeling that this is the sort of film that fond parents wish their children would love, as opposed to a film their children actually will love."
The Water Man,Oyelowo does a superb job of balancing the story's most somber elements with preteen adventure and moments of mordant humor...
The Water Man,"Though Oyelowo's direction is decent, the story never takes you to that special place and the son's venture into the forest rarely feels adventurous."
The Water Man,"What is magical, though, is the chance to root for a young Black male hero as he navigates a family crisis that's both specific and universal, and not based on race."
The Water Man,"It's a tricky balancing act to take an audience from a terminally-ill mom to an avalanche of insects, but director David Oyelowo (working from Emma Needell's Black List screenplay) gets all the tones just right."
The Water Man,"If nothing else, The Water Man is an impactful calling card for Oyelowo, whose choice of debut is a sign of exciting, and big, things to come."
The Water Man,"Ultimately, The Water Man feels a little too slight -- it doesn't come together like I hoped it would after the very promising first act -- but there's enough to like to recommend."
The Water Man,An engaging family film with a light touch.
The Water Man,An engaging for-kids ghost story whose fantasy elements are thoughtfully grounded by real-world concerns...
The Water Man,"A rewarding, (older) family-friendly adventure which packs some crisply executed moments of nail-biting peril into a moving story which deals with grief, loss and newly forged friendships."
Flag Day,The Penns give committed - and in Dylan's case exposed - performances.
Flag Day,"Sean has powerful, painful scenes with Dylan, who is the spitting image of her mother, Robin Wright, and has inherited some of her poise too."
Flag Day,That Penn doesn't want to make a straight crime thriller is laudable - less clear is what he wants to make instead.
Flag Day,Far from the best of Penn's directing work but also not the worst (The Last Face is unlikely to lose that dubious crown). Dylan emerges the most triumphant Penn from a largely boring drama.
Flag Day,"Flag Day desperately wants to be an impassioned testament to the lives of both Jennifer and Dylan, but is hardly ever able to escape the myopic lens of its craftsman."
Flag Day,"Clearly, the picture is a labor of love by the Penns, but too often it just feels labored. There's a sense of everyone trying too hard."
Flag Day,"Like Penn's character, ""Flag Day"" never quite pulls through; as much as you want to believe in it, it winds up a disappointment."
Flag Day,"Subtle flourishes and evanescent feeling abound throughout ""Flag Day,"" in which Vogel's idealized vision of her father feels simultaneously shining and impossibly tarnished."
Flag Day,"It has so much intimacy to it. You can feel how Sean Penn, the director, is in awe of his daughter."
Flag Day,"At times quiet and pensive, at others volatile and rebellious, the younger Penn's freshness galvanizes the father-daughter connection and brings Vogel's memoir to life."
Flag Day,It's all rather undifferentiated and scattershot.
Flag Day,It's clear what the film means to be -- a bittersweet portrait of a daughter's love for her incorrigible father. But the characters don't add up. The complexities and nuances that might have brought them fully to life never made it to the screen.
Flag Day,"""Flag Day"" feels as much a love letter from Penn to his own daughter as the story of someone else's."
Flag Day,"Movies don't give us many father/daughter relationships this complicated, which makes ""Flag Day"" even more chilling."
Flag Day,"As it stretches out, it also thins, its Malick-meets-Cassavetes ambitions never rising above clichés of technique and melodrama."
Flag Day,"Sean Penn directs himself for the first time and has cast Dylan Penn, his daughter with Robin Wright, as the lead - and the two are absolutely mesmerizing together."
Flag Day,Dylan Penn can act. Whatever attention Sean Penn lavished on his daughter to bring out this performance was repaid tenfold.
Flag Day,"Flag Day suffers from the same repetitive, wearying cycle of reconciliation and disappointment that tends to make movies about addiction such a drag."
Flag Day,"While the film sometimes struggles with disparate tones, it's a solid, subtle drama that opts in most cases for restraint over excess."
Flag Day,"A heavy-handed, maladroit take on material that required a sensitive touch."
Flag Day,Everyone in this movie is doing career-worst work.
Flag Day,Flag Day is little more than a near-two-hour montage of tear-streaked faces shouting blandly melodramatic lines at each other.
Flag Day,"Yet in adopting a visual style that once went hand-in-hand with innovation and daring, Flag Day's own lack of either of these things soon becomes conspicuous."
Flag Day,"Flag Day is not a complete misfire, and if a no-name director had made it, the movie would probably get a pass. But considering the emotional stakes involved it's neither terribly memorable nor moving."
Flag Day,"The movie has few tricks on offer but above all, delivers a solid reminder of Penn's filmmaking talent, and welcome evidence that it runs in the family."
Flag Day,It's suffused with what you might call the Penn Darkness Factor.
Flag Day,"Moreover, as a director, [Penn] knows how to bring the horsepower. And so it proves in this very watchable and well-made family drama."
National Champions,"It's very intense, very present day, and I liked it a lot."
National Champions,"While not a perfect film, National Champions does express the discourse around an important issue in a compelling way."
National Champions,"The message is still worth contemplating, but lacking a better vehicle to convey it, feels more deserving of analysis on sports pages than the entertainment space."
National Champions,"He's fighting for compensation for other student-athletes, but other meandering, arbitrary plotlines keep slowing the story's momentum."
National Champions,National Champions devotes most of its time to a contest to see which of its multi-talented cast members can utter the worst dialogue or reveal the most absurd nighttime soap opera plot twists.
National Champions,[Mervis'] playbook of plot devices too often leans on gimmicky twists to propel the narrative: a lazy love affair; a conveniently covered-up crime; and a tragedy that drops out of nowhere.
National Champions,"As timely as last night's episode of ""ESPN Sports Center,"" and as riveting as a well-crafted tick-tock suspenser."
National Champions,National Champions remains effective as an ode to cynical realism but it's uneven at best as a slice of drama.
National Champions,"""National Champions"" is far from perfect, but it gives voice to a growing movement. It might make you think about Saturday afternoons a little differently."
National Champions,The movie dilutes its impact with lackluster direction of samey scenes - people in hotel rooms speechifying - and a distracting nighttime soap subplot.
National Champions,"It's bleak and brutal, and Waugh's cold tone leaves no one with clean hands. But as a testament to the costs of a noble sacrifice in the face of institutional inhumanity, it's as vital as any of his earlier films."
National Champions,"An effective, gripping and thoughtful takedown of college football that takes a complex topic and does something unexpected with it."
National Champions,"You don't have to be into football to appreciate the high-stakes struggle in ""National Champions."""
National Champions,"Despite an outstanding cast, the characters never become more than mouthpieces for some very basic ideas."
National Champions,"As a peek into the relationship between sports, media and capitalism, National Champions feels like a beginner's playbook."
National Champions,"Waugh wants to empathize with each character, or at least for audiences to understand their POV with the same clarity as everyone else's, and it muddles LeMarcus' perspective in a way that makes you want to throw up your hands instead of taking sides."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman is no less insightful into the mercurial vicissitudes of the human condition, but it still finds space for Murakami the fabulist."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","There are sequences of efficient dialogue that — if you close your eyes — unspool the kind of low-key, elliptical tension that Murakami seems to be able to pull off in his sleep. But ... the aggressively odd visuals ruin the illusion."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","A very odd story, but the conversations... are absolutely fascinating."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman",Blind Willow feel[s] like elegantly animated lucid dreams full of poetic imagery: far from realistic but viscerally truthful.
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman",Hits the right notes of strange and angsty.
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","Works well as a visual companion for fans of the author’s work, and as a flawed enigma for everyone else."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","Pierre Földes’ delightful new animated anthology “Blind Willow, Weeping Woman” shows that even the most Murakami-esque source material can be turned into cinema in the right hands."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","Some pleasingly odd visuals and a sustained off-kilter mood will likely please many animation fans who haven’t had any exposure to the source material, but Pierre Foldes’s film ultimately fails to create any clear identity of its own."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","Its themes are a little too softly-spoken to leave a major impact, but an impressively-mounted project."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","It has the ruminative lightness, almost weightlessness, the watercolour delicacy and reticence of the emotions, the sense of the uncanny, the insistent play of erotic possibility and that Murakami keynote: a cat."
"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman","Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman is an impressive achievement, a piece of storytelling which balances moments of flighty whimsy against deeper existential questions, marking Foldes as a talent to watch in the world of adult-skewed animation."
For the Love of Money,Dull and trashy
Courageous,"It takes a certain touch to pull it off, and here, the serviceable cast just doesn't have it in them."
Courageous,"The many topics raised - gangs, drugs, immigration, absentee parents, poverty - are examined with didacticism and platitudes instead of by mining their inherent complexities."
Courageous,"Overplotted and understructured, ""Courageous"" is a slog to get through at 130 minutes."
Courageous,Devolves into over-the-top drama and a suffocating heavy-handedness.
Courageous,Fails to answer the more pressing question of why religious sagas such as this treat subtlety as a sin.
Courageous,"Courageous literally preaches to the converted, delivering ham-fisted messages of responsibility to the most receptive audience possible."
Courageous,"The performances are effective all around with director Kendrick quite moving in the central role of Adam, the veteran officer, who suffers a horrific family tragedy that sets much of the film's plot in motion."
Courageous,Praise be to Courageous for being upfront.
Courageous,"While the film's church-based roots and the tendency toward didactic, schematic storytelling are still in evidence, Courageous is [Sherwood's] most ambitious and watchable film to date."
Courageous,"Like a pastor so caught up in the moment that he can't see that the air conditioning has given out and the congregation wants to go home, the film travels far beyond its dramatic climax, aiming for an altar call finale."
City of Lies,Furman's movie lacks the craft or the confidence to address the unresolved questions of institutional cancer.
City of Lies,"City of Lies is more James Ellroy than docudrama, resulting in a tired police thriller that hitched its wagon to an untenable star."
City of Lies,"As a thriller, it never quite reaches its boiling point, which may be one reason it's been sitting on the shelf since 2018. But as the portrait of a man obsessed and the forces stacked up against him, it earns its stripes."
City of Lies,It's interesting from a forensic standpoint... It ties whole things [about the case] together.
City of Lies,Depp and Forest Whitaker go for authenticity in the gritty drama reminiscent of '70s procedurals.
City of Lies,"The Depp-Whitaker acting duet glues this messy movie together, along with hard-boiled true-crime elements, gritty L.A. backdrops, cherry cars and a propulsive soundtrack that includes Tupac Shakur, N.W.A. and Biggie."
City of Lies,A muckraking drama that deserves to be seen.
City of Lies,"""City of Lies"" seems interested in the wrong mystery."
City of Lies,"""City of Lies"" makes an honest effort but doesn't get the job done."
City of Lies,"The look is grimy and the atmosphere is grim; but what could have been a moody character study or a taut conspiracy thriller is instead a dreary procedural, a misbegotten mush of flashbacks, voice-overs and dead ends."
Our Friend,ERROR
Nine Days,"In addition to a stunning performance from Zazie Beetz, Nine Days also features Benedict Wong, Tony Hale, and Bill Skarsgård."
Nine Days,"Nine Days is, in its subdued way, a profound and powerful commentary on life."
Nine Days,"Although arguably a smidge too ponderous and self-serious for its own good, Nine Days still represents a reasonably promising debut for its writer-director Edson Oda."
Nine Days,The rewards are great for viewers who can go with the movie's bold concept.
Nine Days,"Oda, making an auspicious feature debut, has devised a deliberately stagy - yet surprisingly effective - device to make his point: Life should not be taken for granted."
Nine Days,Pretentious and obnoxious.
Nine Days,"The acting is outstanding, with Benedict Wong, 51, Zazie Beetz and Tony Hale in strong support"
Nine Days,"Winston Duke and Zazie Beetz make the allegory real, human, and utterly compelling and their final scene will live in my heart always."
Nine Days,"Although interesting in many aspects, Nine Days is as often frustrating as it is compelling, and the denouement feels forced."
Nine Days,"Oda's feature is observant and wise and humane, filmed and acted with impeccable care and poise, and the cinematography perfectly compliments its story."
Nine Days,"I liked wrestling with Nine Days, liked feeling the act of moviewatching as an active, not passive, one, and the way Antonio Pinto's strings-forward score nudged my brain to stop churning long enough for pure emotion to kick in."
Nine Days,"Oda believes in his own vision, and he has the confidence to carry it through; it's the type of movie that has so much earnestness baked into its DNA that it could easily fall apart, but in his hands it never does."
Nine Days,"It is very, very difficult for a ""specialty"" film of real quality to find the audience it deserves, especially now. This is one of them."
Nine Days,"There's no shame... in being moved by any or all of ""Nine Days."" At the very least, it marks the arrival of a filmmaker with great potential."
Nine Days,"By withholding easy resolutions or platitudes, Oda allows ""Nine Days"" to be a vessel through which viewers can fundamentally wrestle with themselves about what it means to live life, and what it means to witness life on screen, and in the moment."
Nine Days,"It's heavy, heady stuff, coming at you via a delivery system of catalog-worthy set design, magic-hour cinematography, and often tamped-down, deadpan performances. And somehow, it all works in harmony."
Nine Days,"A life-affirming epiphany, ""Nine Days"" is cinema of a higher calling, spiritual without denomination."
Nine Days,"Oda's touch is extremely controlled, and the actors are so connected to what they are doing, that the film doesn't feel manipulative. The catharsis, when it comes, is exhilarating."
Nine Days,"In both its sentimental view of existence and its bold lack of internal logic, Nine Days feels very much like a faith-based movie that prioritizes messaging over subtlety, logic, or even consistency."
Nine Days,"Oda is a very assured and sometimes inspired filmmaker, and he handles his actors beautifully. Duke and Beetz in particular deliver performances for the ages."
Nine Days,Nine Days resonates at such a distinct frequency that some may find it hauntingly beautiful... while others may find it much too blaring.
Nine Days,Writer-director Edson Oda never really puts a unique spin on the familiar story of otherworldly figures peering in on the lives of the living.
Nine Days,"Nine Days is a beautiful, memorable work, with its soft visuals from cinematographer Wyatt Garfield and deeply moving score by Antonio Pinto, but its Oda's writing that soars above all."
Nine Days,"New Age fables such as Nine Days are rarely my bag... Still, this first feature from US-based Brazilian director Edson Oda is impressively polished -- and beneath all the wilful quirk, there's a certain amount of genuine weirdness."
Nine Days,Nine Days [is]... evocative and heartfelt in its every beating minute.
Nine Days,"More than anything, ""Nine Days"" feels wholly original. It's proof that moviegoing magpies can still find one-of-a-kind baubles if they look long enough."
Nine Days,One of the most unexpected experiences I've had in almost a decade of going to Sundance.
Nine Days,An absolute masterpiece.
Nine Days,"Not for everyone, but one of the striking directorial debuts of recent years."
Nine Days,"Oda's script struggles to make this dynamic as compelling as the ethereal world he establishes upfront... Nevertheless, the movie provides a remarkable showcase for Duke's range."
Nine Days,"""Nine Days"" is that rare work of art that invites you to re-consider your entire worldview."
Red Rocket,I don't think Simon Rex is in any way to blame for me hating [Mikey]. I think it's a tremendous performance.
Red Rocket,"Baker’s movies have always been about location, location, location, and Red Rocket is no different."
Red Rocket,It is Rexs extraordinary puppy-dog vigour that makes the character tolerable in spite of his repeated appalling decisions.
Red Rocket,"As well as being filthy, droll and almost unbearably tense, it offers great news for anyone too broke to go to drama school."
Red Rocket,"A dirty delight. Weird, smart, fantastic and very, very wrong."
Red Rocket,"Rex actively underplays Mikey’s self-interest and cruelty, so that -- in a way -- the audience becomes an equal target of his manipulation."
Red Rocket,"Rex, who has a colourful background of his own, is charismatic enough to leave no doubt about Mikey’s powers of persuasion. The question is whether audiences will tolerate the company of someone who starts out bad and gets worse."
Red Rocket,"Baker delivers a truly outstanding piece of Americana in this deliriously sexy, silly and genuinely thrilling metaphor for the Trump era."
Red Rocket,"A kinetic, funny film that owes it all to the snake it makes you wish you had never set eyes on."
Red Rocket,"A beguiling and beautiful film about a total toerag, Red Rocket is a unique character study: Mikey Saber will charm your socks off, and you’ll hate him for it."
Red Rocket,"The backdrop of this film is, not by accident, Trump's election in 2016... There's a lot of Warren Beatty's Shampoo character in Mikey. That film, of course, set against Nixon's election."
Red Rocket,"It’s about the American underclass, ignored, bitter, desperate and, when the opportunity arises, full of fight."
Red Rocket,"The film's ambivalence is its strength -- leaving us room to be seduced by its deluded anti-hero, and to share his entrancement with his sleazy American dream."
Red Rocket,"I miss quieter movies with their slow-build character studies. Watching director Sean Baker's Red Rocket, a portrait of fictional aging porn actor Mikey Saber (Simon Rex), was a reminder of how great those can be."
Red Rocket,[Director Sean Baker] has a real feel for the underside of life that's not compromising or demeaning.
Red Rocket,"I think we're at the point where we can say there is such a thing as a ""Sean Baker Film."""
Red Rocket,"""Red Rocket"" isn't like any other movie you've seen this year. Expect the taste of pink sparkle doughnuts to linger."
Red Rocket,"Rex is simply magnetic as Mikey, a character he brings to life through hisrat-a-tat patter, his jittery mannerisms and theself-serving interactions he has with others."
Red Rocket,"A movie that is outrageously fun, savagely smart, brightly satirical, and ultimately haunting."
Red Rocket,"Baker can't seem to decide whether he wants us to laugh at, to pity or to understand his subjects."
Red Rocket,What it dispenses in salaciousness fails to account for the lack of any meaningful undercurrent that might make the vulgarity interesting.
Red Rocket,Rex... deserves a litany of nominations for his performance of such a knotty character.
Red Rocket,"Raunchy, restless, cinematically vital..."
Red Rocket,This is an admirable work centering on a man who has likely never done an admirable thing in his entire rotten life.
Red Rocket,"As Mikey, Rex is phenomenal. It's a raw performance that will be remembered for years to come."
Red Rocket,There is a sincerity here that sticks.
Red Rocket,"Even if Red Rocket does feel like it captures something about our national makeup, it's a draining experience to spend so much time with Mikey..."
Red Rocket,"Mr. Rex has had a career of no great distinction... Yet his portrayal of Mikey is a memorable spectacle, an engine of huge urgency for a jalopy with a slipping clutch and no steering gear."
Red Rocket,"Despite its missteps, this is [Sean Baker's] best-directed film, judged purely in terms of how economically he sets up and pays off each mile marker in the story."
Red Rocket,"[A] deliriously funny and deviously satirical new comedy about a very specific, finely sketched specimen of parasitic American hustler."
Red Rocket,"Son's performance is wonderful: she's fresh and sunny, all right, but she's like a daisy with a tough little fringe of ambition."
Red Rocket,"""Red Rocket"" is both a laser-focused character study and a scrappy, scrupulously observed portrait of a tight-knit community."
Red Rocket,"It's funny and abrasive, but also coy and, in the end, a bit tedious."
Red Rocket,An uproariously unhinged slice of Americana.
Red Rocket,"Mikey is a very hard character to play well but Simon Rex has his rascally number. We never fall for his manipulations but, from afar, admire his machinations, nonetheless."
Red Rocket,"Only Baker could somehow make a Pilgrim's Progress about a loser with a giant penis into a slightly goofy, cracked celebration of life on the fringes."
Red Rocket,"Red Rocket is far more sour than sweet, but that's part of the point; Mikey is a reprehensible fellow, but he's clawed his way through life by sheer force of will, and as such, the camera simply can't look away."
Red Rocket,"The actors, except for Rex, are mostly nonprofessionals who work gamely to infuse the caricatural script... with heart and the director's incurious camera eye with life, but their presence can't overcome the movie's vain attitudinizing."
Red Rocket,"Once the ensemble, place and time are set the script, direction and Mikey lead nowhere."
Red Rocket,"Bolstered by a hilarious, self-reflexive performance by Simon Rex of Scary Movie fame, who plays a manipulative, washed-up porn star trying to get his life together and failing to get out of his own way."
Red Rocket,"The director's singular gift for street casting - beyond Rex, hardly anyone here has acted professionally - and deeply embedded sense of mood works its own kind of unhurried alchemy."
Red Rocket,"Freewheeling and kissed by the magic hour light like Baker's previous movies, Red Rocket is among the filmmaker's best works."
Red Rocket,"Building off the scrappy beauty of ""Tangerine"" and ""The Florida Project,"" director Sean Baker again trains his sights on a vivid milieu and a fascinatingly singular character."
Red Rocket,"Red Rocket feels hand-tooled, made from the ground up, enterprisingly cast and untampered with by executives or marketing types. It feels as creatively pure as a novel by a kid just out of college. May it stay that way for Baker as long as he wants it to."
Red Rocket,"Baker further provokes with his slamming tonal transitions and overlaps: the film frequently knots stomach-churning tragedy and farcical, high-pitched comedy into the same scene."
Red Rocket,"Admirers of Baker's earlier work will have a journey to go on here, first in missing the rowdy companionship of protagonists who weren't wholly out for themselves."
Red Rocket,"There are some truly riotous moments, and as a character study on how one man's awfulness permeates across everyone he meets, this is fascinating stuff."
Red Rocket,"Baker finds a kind of poetry in this pocket of Texas, packing it with a rich and diverse array of personalities..."
Red Rocket,"Sean Baker is dedicated at the same time to the material realities of being poor in the United States and to the irreverent artificiality of snap zooms, smash cuts, and unexpected music cues."
Red Rocket,"Red Rocket is yet another example of Baker's keen handling of actors, professionals and not."
Red Rocket,"This is vivid, real-life film-making, without the need of an epic budget."
Red Rocket,"While ""Red Rocket"" very ably explores the headspace and mechanisms of the 100% beef-fed all-American huckster, it loses a step or two when it does so as a kind of morality tale assessing the damage and human toll."
Red Rocket,"It's a pleasure to put yourself in Baker's capable hands as he ambles through his loose story with its affectionate, slyly humorous character observations and immersive sense of place."
Red Rocket,"Here, it's the cred Rex brings to a role that's the first genuinely meaty role of the B-lister's career, and he's not about to blow it, inhabiting the hyper, always-hustling Saber the way Mickey Rourke did ""The Wrestler."""
Red Rocket,"""Red Rocket"" remains such a blisteringly raw and febrile character study because of how things fluctuate along the fixed orbit of its star."
Blue Bayou,ERROR
The Mauritanian,"Filmed largely indoors and in often claustrophobic spaces, the movie isn't always subtle, but its impact is felt particularly in the scenes featuring Rahim. His powerful performance is supported respectfully by Foster, Cumberbatch and Woodley."
The Mauritanian,"The subject is charismatic in a way that the film is not. But he is VERY charismatic, and it's his performance that sees this through."
The Mauritanian,"The real-life story is enraging, and it's fun to see Benedict Cumberbatch's morally conflicted military prosecutor lock horns with Foster's icy human rights lawyer."
The Mauritanian,"Few viewers will find themselves unengaged during The Mauritanian, but there are too many middlebrow beats either side of the jarring chords."
The Mauritanian,Macdonald and his producers and writers wanted too much... The result? A bland smattering of each that teases us with the possibility of complex roles.
The Mauritanian,"The film's power lies in its direct confrontation with the ideology that underpinned it all... The Mauritanian is notable, too, for how much of its perspective is actually granted to Salahi."
The Mauritanian,"While the procedural aspects of the legal case sometimes get in the way of the existential and moral side of things, Macdonald still manages to tell a truly riveting story, one which needed to be told."
The Mauritanian,"Uhh, 2004 called, it wants its outraged anti-Bush thriller back."
The Mauritanian,"Who is really threatening the soul of America, the movie asks, repeatedly and at full courtroom volume."
The Mauritanian,"Wasting big-name actors, The Mauritanian is simultaneously over-stuffed and under-powered, turning a horrifying real-life ordeal into something flat and formulaic."
The Mauritanian,"This movie is a condemnation of what the US government did at Gitmo, which is still open, though with only 40 inmates, compared with the high point of 780."
The Mauritanian,"The Mauritanian might easily have been a decent albeit forgettable political biopic, but Tahar Rahim's dignified performance makes it a far more enduring and memorable film."
The Mauritanian,"Tahar Rahim, as Mohamedou Salahi, gives a performance as haunting as any in the great American prison dramas admired around the world."
The Mauritanian,"A chilling story that played out in our not-too-distant history, The Mauritanian stands as a testament to how important it is to formalise the telling of true stories such as these so we don't forget their lessons"
The Mauritanian,[An] admirable but perfunctory adaptation of Mohamedou Ould Slahi's best-selling memoir...
The Mauritanian,"Great performances by all of these actors. It's a solid film about what happened, but I don't if it's fantastic dramatic fodder."
The Mauritanian,It's really solid and also feels like it is maybe coming out 10 years too late.
The Mauritanian,"""The Mauritanian"" has the elements of a slow-burn government thriller, and Macdonald slowly turns up the heat, never boiling over or steering into overwrought or grandstanding territory."
The Mauritanian,"So while Macdonald manages to come up with one of the most impressively brutal cut-to-black endings in recent memory, the rest of this feature cannot hope to match the power of his cast."
The Mauritanian,"The Mauritanian is effective in communicating the overall vibe a movie like this needs: the tension, the claustrophobia, and the increasingly pervasive sense that something is wrong here."
The Mauritanian,"The Mauritanian wants to be a fusion of Papillon and A Few Good Men, but it cannot work out whether it wants to make a purely emotive argument, or engage in a brutal cross-examination of the legal system."
The Mauritanian,"The Mauritanian is a bit of a throwback -- a solid, old-fashioned piece of entertainment, but not a great movie."
The Mauritanian,Rahim is supplying soul and some interesting shades of gray to this portraiture. He's giving you a person in the middle of what often feels like a broad prestige-drama sketch.
The Mauritanian,"Luckily, ""The Mauritanian,"" directed by Kevin Macdonald, gets one thing very right: Tahar Rahim's masterful central performance."
The Mauritanian,What pulls the movie out of its stylistic complacency is Rahim's performance as Slahi.
The Mauritanian,"Tahar Rahim does a brilliant job of portraying the title character, a man who's resilient and possibly guilty, with Jodie Foster in prime form as his lawyer."
The Mauritanian,"The Mauritanian fails to humanize the story it's telling, never coming off as something more challenging or interesting than a superficial, manipulative accounting of true events."
The Mauritanian,"""The Mauritanian"" is a moral muddle as well as a narrative one, and it leaves you wondering why our empathy for Slahi has to be so mediated, negotiated and rationalized in the first place."
The Mauritanian,"As directed by Kevin Macdonald (""The Last King of Scotland""), it's a steady, compelling accounting of events that intends to leave you infuriated and succeeds."
The Mauritanian,"Rahim noses ""The Mauritanian"" just over the line into the realm of a mild recommendation."
The Mauritanian,"The Mauritanian... reaches for something not many Hollywood productions do: Telling a story centered not just the moral quandaries its Western characters face, but on the soul of the man at the center of it all."
The Mauritanian,"Mohamedou is a tricky character, since we only get glimpses of him and he makes a lot of mistakes, but Rahim invests him with integrity and courage..."
The Mauritanian,Despite the harrowing details of Slahi's story... director Kevin Macdonald can't fully transcend simplistic characterisations and an overall conventionality.
The Mauritanian,"Flavorless characters and a blizzard of flashbacks further repel our involvement in a drama whose timing, to say the least, is unfortunate."
The Mauritanian,"With sounder editing and some badly needed cuts, it could be a better movie than it is, but it's worth seeing for what it says about the America we're experiencing now as well as the America of the recent past."
The Mauritanian,"One can still wish, however, for a little finesse, or at least a movie in which the dialogue doesn't largely consist of characters shouting into each other's faces..."
The Mauritanian,Rahim fleshes out Slahi as a real person; he's not just a victim or someone to be saved. Though Rahim has been in English-language projects previously... American audiences should really sit up and take notice of his performance here.
The Mauritanian,"The movie lands, through no fault of its own other than timing, with a whiff of been-there, done-that."
The Mauritanian,A gruelling true-life story of incarceration and torture is made eminently watchable by a central performance from Tahar Rahim that ranks among his best.
The Mauritanian,It's inspired work in the rather dogged circumstances.
The Mauritanian,"The Mauritanian"" is buoyed only by Tahar Rahim's humane performance ."
The Mauritanian,It's opaque and frustrating.
The Mauritanian,"That sinking feeling that audiences might get at seeing the words ""based on a true story"" open a film is completely merited here."
The Mauritanian,"This legal procedural remains strangely flat, despite its star power and a gripping central performance from Tahar Rahim as Slahi."
The Mauritanian,"""The Mauritanian"" delivers the shock, outrage and ultimate comeuppance that audiences expect..."
The Mauritanian,Kevin Macdonald's film never captures the spectrum of a life lived in unimaginable extremis.
Four Good Days,Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this shallow movie is left unexplored: why doesn't Deb look in the mirror at her role in Molly's addiction?
Four Good Days,Mila Kunis does her finest acting work alongside Glenn Close...
Four Good Days,It is a couple of good performances in a movie that feels like we have seen it a thousand times before.
Four Good Days,"The subject matter will certainly resonate for many, but even with its fact-based underpinnings Four Good Days feels like a bit of a Frankenstein monster, stitched together from past addiction movies."
Four Good Days,"Character actor Stephen Root, 69, plays the largely understanding stepfather in this contemporary tearjerker released in the shadow of the Oscar-nominated Hillbilly Elegy."
Four Good Days,"These are important stories that should be seen, but audiences need more than scripts that are primarily acting exercises."
Four Good Days,"What sets ""Four Good Days"" apart from the many other films of its ilk are Close and Kunis, who sharpen and elevate its well-worn contours with vivid performances that are honest and grounded."
Four Good Days,"Scene by scene, Close and Kunis drag us into their family problems, and we end up caring."
Four Good Days,"""Four Good Days"" is more complex than its outward trappings and preachier scenes - like an anguished Molly addressing a high school class - suggest."
Four Good Days,"[C]o-writer and director Rodrigo García (who worked with Close on ""Albert Nobbs"") knows where to keep his focus and how to frame his story."
Four Good Days,"Both Glenn Close and Mila Kunis are very talented actors, but Four Good Days gives them absolutely nothing interesting to say or do."
Four Good Days,"Still, ""Four Good Days"" nails what addiction is like for the afflicted and those who love them. Close and Kunis work well together."
Four Good Days,"""Four Good Days"" could be a better movie, but I'm not sure that matters."
Four Good Days,"Though this agonizing weeklong ordeal reaches a shrill climax, the denouement feels rushed, opaque, leaving us only with more questions."
Four Good Days,"Four Good Days doesn't have much to offer to the audience, except for an occasionally effective Glenn Close."
Four Good Days,"Even with two strong lead performances, ""Four Good Days"" feels awfully well-worn."
Four Good Days,"As a performer's showcase, ""Four Good Days"" does the job. But there's not much to see here otherwise."
Four Good Days,"Persuasively acted, compassionately observed and thoroughly unsurprising, this is well-intentioned material that never quite gets beyond its inspired-by-a-true-story, issue-driven TV movie-of-the-week template."
Four Good Days,"""Four Good Days"" is based on a true story, and the way it plays out is both watchable and plausible. Yet the movie doesn't shake us to our souls."
Witnesses,I recommend it for members of the church that want to learn more about these key players in church history but that's about it.
God’s Not Dead: We the Peop…,"The fourth film in the Christian franchise dresses down the elites, at long last."
CS Lewis: The Most Reluctan…,A disciplined and beautifully constructed motion picture with a cast understanding of all the fine nuances of Lewis's life and Lewis's written words.
CS Lewis: The Most Reluctan…,"As good as ""Reluctant"" is, it is far from a complete overview of Lewis's life, which is not at all a bad thing. The movie accomplishes what it set out to do; it wasn't trying to be a full-blown biography."
CS Lewis: The Most Reluctan…,"THE MOST RELUCTANT CONVERT is a singularly touching, artistic, and even spiritual experience."
"My Sailor, My Love","""My Sailor, My Love"" is at its best in these moments where it explores Grace’s pain."
"My Sailor, My Love","Grace’s resentment is an astute twist. Imagine Disney’s singing teapot enrolling in primal scream therapy, except when Grace attends a support group for women who’ve given too much, she can’t let out her steam."
"My Sailor, My Love","Much of this film is appealing, with the three lead performances offering subtle insights into their complex characters."
"My Sailor, My Love","It would not ... be right to describe My Sailor, My Love as any sort of soapy romance. Jimmy Karlsson and Kirsi Vikman’s screenplay fleshes out a cluster of circling characters with great incisiveness."
"My Sailor, My Love",Filled with sage wisdom and vulnerable people struggling to do the best that they can even when they are at their worst. It’s a lovely indie.
Joe Bell,"Joe Bell is painful, sincere. Its most optimistic and substantial strand is its belief in the possibility of, not forgiveness for the unaccepting, but acceptance in itself"
Joe Bell,"Wahlberg, who's one of the producers, presumably saw the film as a departure. He's required to do more emoting here than in maybe all of his previous movies combined. He's up to the challenge."
Joe Bell,"Though it sometimes feels treacly and hackneyed, or even predictable,""Joe Bell"" resists expectation, and where this true story ends up is far more poignant and devastating than any work of fiction could be."
Joe Bell,"It's incredibly formulaic and mawkish, although its heart is obviously in the right place."
Joe Bell,An occasionally moving film that misses its chance at greatness.
Joe Bell,"It's a bridge-building piece of Americana that doesn't let anyone off the hook, although the closing upbeat/inspirational notes seem a bit odd."
Joe Bell,The message here is impossible to assail. Where the film goes wrong is in the way it relates it.
Joe Bell,"A flawed but noble failure about the tragic effects of bullying on gay teenagers that, for many reasons, sadly delivers much less than it promises."
Joe Bell,It is well-intentioned but the abrupt shift due to the facts of the real story derails the message it is trying to deliver.
Joe Bell,"""Joe Bell"" is based on a true story, and is a well-intentioned tale about the need for acceptance and tolerance. If only its execution was as clear as its message."
Joe Bell,"""Bell"" says something deeply significant about being gay and being bullied in a worthwhile yet flawed film."
Joe Bell,Joe Bell is preaching to the converted and unlikely to draw in the type of audience that actually needs to hear its pleas for kindness in a mean and wild world.
Joe Bell,A droopy drama with its feet on the blacktop and its heart set on redemption.
Joe Bell,There's a good movie in the story of Joe Bell and Jadin Bell. The good one struggles to emerge from the good try we have here.
Joe Bell,Although Miller is excellent... Wahlberg seems out of his league here...
Joe Bell,"""Joe Bell"" is better than it had to be. In fact, if you go in knowing the movie's subject, you'll find it more complicated and interesting than you might expect."
Joe Bell,Authentic moments are few in the well-intentioned drama about the bullying of a gay teen and the response of his flustered father.
Joe Bell,"The tired, tasteless gimmick at the center of the film inadvertently reveals its entire problem of perspective."
Joe Bell,The film has an emotional core that hooks you from the first frame until the final epilogue describing the burdens of the real Joe Bell.
Joe Bell,"The drama is well-intentioned - it may very well expand narrow minds - but is also heavy-handed, manipulative, and thin on character."
Joe Bell,"""It means well"" is the faint praise one uses to damn a movie like this. Maybe it could have worked with a different star."
Joe Bell,"A film that checks all the boxes for broad demographic appeal, while also just not being very good at what it's trying to do by virtue of choosing a shallow, obvious approach over a complex, character-driven one."
Joe Bell,"Reinaldo Marcus Green's redemptive drama ""Good Joe Bell,"" based on a true story, is a brisk character study that succumbs to its shallow straight gaze."
Joe Bell,"Good Joe Bell could have been schmaltzy, simplistic, too hungry for uplift. Green, though-and McMurtry and Ossana and, gulp, Wahlberg-keep the film in check."
Joe Bell,It's a quietly affecting road trip that gets to where it wants to go and may prompt a few tears along the way.
Joe Bell,"While formulaic on its face, Green's film resists the sort of obvious cinematic catharsis expected of such a story, resulting in a final product that earns its emotional beats."
Joe Bell,"Hardly anything Joe Bell says in ""Good Joe Bell"" suggests that he understood his son in the slightest, and it's not clear that the filmmakers do either."
Joe Bell,"Green's grasp of this tender, family-focused story shows equal restraint and compassion, and mastery of a tricky structure."
Joe Bell,"There's something disarmingly genuine about the film, a little obvious at times perhaps, but also remarkably unforgiving."
C’mon C’mon,"Quietly, shamblingly human after the spectacular derangement of Joker, [Phoenix] plays Johnny with an inconsistent complicated history of care and affection woven into his slouchy body language and muted line readings."
C’mon C’mon,"It’s as if the film’s real purpose were to reassure an educated, progressive audience, full of worries about themselves and the world, that their lives are in some basic sense OK."
C’mon C’mon,"C'mon C'mon is awash with regret-over badly tended sibling relationships, undealt-with mommy issues, but also the satisfaction of everyday caretaking, the hope implicit in all those lunches made and dishes done."
C’mon C’mon,"What we have here is basically a 2020s riff on 'Kramer vs. Kramer,' the modern man, unexpectedly pressed into child-rearing, and finding something of himself in the process."
C’mon C’mon,C'mon C'mon is a great big bear hug wrapped in celluloid.
C’mon C’mon,This is a movie about listening - really listening - to what other people have to say.
C’mon C’mon,The chemistry of Mills's cast is so compelling that it carries the film above the weight of its more navel-gazing moments.
C’mon C’mon,"A film, heartfelt yet deeply considered, that in almost every scene is trying to make sense of that happy, sad, full, empty and always shifting life that we are in."
C’mon C’mon,"Phoenix, Hoffman and Norman, especially, amuse and move with their relatable performances in Mills' sweet drama. It's nicely visualised but can feel unnecessarily long in places."
C’mon C’mon,"If the movie can feel just a little curated, what it tells us is worth hearing anyway. Generationally, to listen and learn should always be a two-way street."
C’mon C’mon,"""C'mon C'mon"" doesn't need to make a lot of noise to be heard. Sometimes, there's more value in listening."
C’mon C’mon,"Perfectly captures the constant feelings of terror, inadequacy, panic, exhaustion, and the tsunami of love and gratitude and hope and hilarity of caring for a child."
C’mon C’mon,"The narrative tension might be fairly described as minimal. But in focusing on protagonists who aren't epically messed up or dysfunctional, it performs a feat of delicate, gently humane subversion."
C’mon C’mon,"Will you be moved by the film's central, flowering relationship, which opens up roughly the way you think it will? Well, I was."
C’mon C’mon,"Great child performances only happen when the child and director are both excellent and, however he did it, Mills managed to capture one beautiful, real, telling moment after another from Norman."
C’mon C’mon,"After wringing out your handkerchief, you'll want to call and make amends with someone in your life."
C’mon C’mon,"This is the rare film whose crux lies in the idea of children being taken seriously about their feelings, hopes, concerns."
C’mon C’mon,"A tremendous showing from Joaquin Phoenix, operating at a register he's rarely found before. It's a career best for him - lovely, empathetic, humane."
C’mon C’mon,"Phoenix gives a warm, subtle performance as a journalist getting to know his oddball nephew."
C’mon C’mon,"C'mon C'mon is an intricate, moving drama constantly thrown off balance by this Tasmanian Devil of a child, an unpredictable force of nature."
C’mon C’mon,"""C'mon C'mon"" feels real."
C’mon C’mon,Some of C'mon C'mon's gestures - which position people of colour as props in a white family drama - can get icky.
C’mon C’mon,"[Phoenix] makes the entire endeavour worthwhile, but substitute any other performer in the role, and the film would crumble completely."
C’mon C’mon,"""C'mon C'mon"" is about the present, and how precious it truly is."
C’mon C’mon,It's a heartfelt film that has some terrific stuff in it.
C’mon C’mon,"It's a cliche of a tale... but Mills sells it, largely thanks to Phoenix's expertly calibrated performance as a capable, thoughtful, and vulnerable man who needs to be poked and prodded a little. I was moved, even a little verklempt."
C’mon C’mon,"C'mon C'mon doesn't really go anywhere in particular. It's a meandering experience, but purposefully so. And it's the kind of film that makes you want to leave the theater and ask the big, cheesy, sincere questions of strangers, family, anyone really."
C’mon C’mon,"There's not a lot of plot here, but there's life as we know it and as the movies don't always bottle it, and that's enough."
C’mon C’mon,Mills is one of the few filmmakers you could trust with a story like this; he never lets the proceedings veer into sentimentality.
C’mon C’mon,A sincere drama about relationships.
C’mon C’mon,"For all its indulgent introspection, Mills' latest remains miraculously unpunchable."
C’mon C’mon,"""C'mon C'mon"" is a nice movie about characters who are so nice that I almost feel bad for not being nicely disposed toward them or this movie..."
C’mon C’mon,"""C'mon C'mon"" is a tender and turbulent melodrama that amplifies its power with a documentary current."
C’mon C’mon,"Mills' core insight remains the same in every film: We're all screwed up to some degree, all constantly improvising, all doing the best we can with relatively few guidelines."
C’mon C’mon,"No Joker in sight as the stellar and always surprising Joaquin Phoenix shows his tender side in this bracing, bittersweet family dramedy from Mike Mills, whose movie is a quiet thing, but with a delicate, soulful magic you won't soon forget."
C’mon C’mon,"C'mon C'mon admirably doesn't indulge in heartstring-tugging pathos, but the film suffers from a certain shapelessness."
C’mon C’mon,There are two films in this one movie vying for attention. The better of the duo is a documentary in which filmmakers travel around the country to inner cities asking young students very philosophical questions about life.
C’mon C’mon,"It's an impressively contrived film, almost a machine for winning awards, a monochrome reverie of midlife yearning."
C’mon C’mon,"This falls into the time-honoured tradition of movies about closed-off guys learning to feel from the innocents left in their charge, but Mills skirts triteness by softening Phoenix's usual intensity."
C’mon C’mon,"No matter how far they travel, the dramatic trajectory never leads anywhere particularly interesting, remaining in a self-regarding bubble the entire time."
C’mon C’mon,"If a carefully plotted, meticulously polished drama is what you're after, you'll want to pass on C'mon C'mon. If you're up for going with the fascinating flow of a mercurial tale, this distinctive feature by Mike Mills may be just the ticket."
C’mon C’mon,"One of the most deeply reflective American filmmakers working today, Mills is a storyteller with a baring, raw sense of honesty, unafraid of abruptly burst emotions."
C’mon C’mon,Unguarded and achingly truthful.
C’mon C’mon,It's a wispy yet insightful and emotionally satisfying film...
C’mon C’mon,Heartfelt and wise...
C’mon C’mon,"It's as easy to forgive the sleepy and self-effacing ""C'mon C'mon"" for its missteps as it is to forgive the film's characters for their own."
C’mon C’mon,"Bittersweet, gently profound collisions of art and life."
C’mon C’mon,"A small, soft-spoken yet casually profound family drama..."
The Father,"An adventure film with its heart in the modern tradition of Romanian film drama, it should appeal to a larger audience than pure art house fans."
After We Fell,They seem to be caught in a loop composed of a never-ending series of quarrels reliably followed by make-up sex shot in languorous close-up and accompanied by anodyne pop.
After We Fell,"Though After We Fell aims for the scintillating eroticism of a lithe young couple risking getting caught with some semi-public hot tub sex, the whole experience is more akin to taking a lukewarm bath in a swimsuit."
After We Fell,Should come with a warning to viewers: contains extremely boring sex.
Nomadland,Chloe Zhao's Nomadland mimics life scrupulously...
Nomadland,What's most striking about Nomadland is the almost incidental manner in which it tells its stories - eschewing strident dramatic crises or narrative lurches for something altogether more ambient.
Nomadland,Not since Robert Redford in All Is Lost has a star performer carried an entire film through wordless looks and glances.
Nomadland,Frances McDormand delivers a career-best turn in this gently meditative drama about the failure of the American dream.
Nomadland,"Life on the road has never been so tenderly captured, politically alive and profoundly moving."
Nomadland,"Personally, I am fine with the more sentimental moments of Nomadland. Social realism needs the space to contain multitudes and contradictions, just as life does."
Nomadland,McDormand masters an unshowy integrity that rarely grates against her less seasoned costars.
Nomadland,"As Fern, [Frances McDormand] pecks at conversation like a bird, and moves like a lizard, holding still as if to conserve energy before darting off suddenly. Her bravest choice is to embody the character's passion without always rendering it palatable."
Nomadland,"Ii could not have been made anywhere but the United States. The vast expanses of the Western desert, the purple mountains' chilly majesty, provide a stark, flat, unwelcoming setting for the story about retirees and other Americans living in their vans."
Nomadland,"Nomadland treats its subjects with respect and curiosity. Their misfortunes are not used to objectify or other them, as often happens in movies about an impoverished subculture."
Nomadland,"Phenomenal. A director we'll hear about for a while to come...a great opportunity to catch her before she makes that big leap, I think people will really enjoy it."
Nomadland,There's a genuine and emotional sense of presence as the viewer moves with Fern through the beautifully realized environs of Nomadland.
Nomadland,"""Nomadland"" feels simultaneously like both a memory and a prophecy. Zhao has managed to marry these juxtaposing ideas in her film, which is the essence of bittersweet distilled into an arrow and shot straight through the heart."
Nomadland,"In the end, ""Nomadland"" delivers a liberal-libertarian longing for a vague, undefined restoration of what was."
Nomadland,"""Nomadland"" is a chronicle of the Great Recession that plays like a quietly thoughtful, real-life ""Grapes of Wrath,"" with McDormand's Fern as its understated Tom Joad - strong, resolute, haunting."
Nomadland,That is the challenge of this approach: committing to the [neorealist] aesthetic but relying on a star to carry it.
Nomadland,"It's just so deeply felt, moving, meditative, compassionate and beautiful. It's both majestic and kind of mundane."
Nomadland,"""Nomadland"" balances with spine-tingling grace between respect for that restlessness of spirit and longing for a society that has any notion of how to care for it."
Nomadland,"Nomadland is achingly beautiful and sad, a profound work of empathy from Zhao. It's a true elegy, a lament for the dead, a yearning for the lost."
Nomadland,"A road movie like no other, Nomadland is a modest masterpiece like no other. Beautifully unadorned and heart-in-your-mouth stirring, it's leisurely yet urgent, with a singular tone that lies somewhere between elegy and hope."
Nomadland,"Zhao's movie is really defined by its texture and tone, and there's not a whole lot of meat or momentum to the story. Ultimately, it's a window into a way of life that will seem foreign to most in the modern age."
Nomadland,"The affecting, uneven Nomadland, set early in 2011 in the wake of the Great Recession but equally pertinent today, is a road movie of a very special sort."
Nomadland,Fern and McDormand are... a window into a painful corner of America that is all too easy to look away from. Good for Zhao for pointing her camera directly at it.
Nomadland,This is an elemental film in which everyday conversations and actions - and even gthe pauses the punctuate them - hold tremendous weight.
Nomadland,"McDormand disappears into Fern, which is no small accomplishment for an actor as recognizable as she is."
Nomadland,"McDormand turns Fern into a great protagonist, but she lacks narrative direction. By the end, Nomadland frustratingly wanders off the edge of the map."
Nomadland,"There is great power in this movie's subtle choices, and what they add up to is an astonishing achievement in American film."
Nomadland,"In a fine Emersonian spirit, the movie rebels against its own conventional impulses, gravitating toward an idea of experience that is more complicated, more open-ended, more contradictory than what most American movies are willing to permit."
Nomadland,"""Nomadland"" is the kind of big and big-hearted movie - featuring a central performance at once epic and fine-tuned - that reminds you of how much life one film can hold, when circumstances allow."
Nomadland,"The contemplative ""Nomadland"" whispers instead of shouts its grievances about contemporary American life, and is all the more powerful for it."
Nomadland,"Zhao has emerged as a brilliant storyteller, able to convey a lot of emotion in such a subtle way you don't even realize the wallop till a while after it's hit you."
Nomadland,The invaluable David Strathairn deserves best supporting actor consideration for his beautifully understated performance as the road-weary nomad Dave...
Nomadland,"Zhao shows us the difficulty of this life - the endless laundromats, the cramped bed in the van, the cold, the possessions left behind - but also its beauty and freedom."
Nomadland,"""Nomadland"" is an existential exploration of the notion of freedom, of life lived on the blurry edges of American society, untethered to traditional ideals of society."
Nomadland,Zhao's film is a a poetic Malickian ode to the pioneering nature of the restless American spirit.
Nomadland,"Zhao places the failed promises of the American dream alongside some of its most beautiful, breathtaking vistas, as Fern pursues a life that isn't driven by a search for success and wealth."
Nomadland,"Through these characters, Zhao is able to examine the idea of wide-open frontiers without nostalgia or the need to pathologize the parts of our social structures that are eroding or have failed."
Nomadland,"Nomadland's clarity of thought on the concept of home, the environment, on women, on the elderly in society, on the very idea of human kindness, make this film much more than a passing moment."
Nomadland,"It's very much its own thing, very much an original experience, and must be counted as some odd kind of good movie."
Nomadland,"A captivating, immersive and deeply emotionally intelligent character portrait"
Nomadland,"More than most road movies, this is a series of brief encounters, of short, intense friendships and sad farewells. As Wells says, ""I'll see you down the road."""
Nomadland,"The least actressy of actresses, McDormand merges completely with the landscape and everybody in it. The friendships that Fern makes spring from a collective store of commonsense gained from experience and coloured with playful good humour."
Nomadland,"Chloe Zhao's thoughtful balance of majesty and intimacy makes Nomadland one of the most accomplished films of the year, an emotional tour de force that moves you but never imposes or manipulates."
Nomadland,"Zhao once again relies on mixed methods, non-fiction rendered into compellingly realistic drama thanks to a cast of non-professional actors playing versions of themselves. The result is as stimulating and satisfying as it is iffy and curious."
Nomadland,Fern works at an Amazon plant to afford a life with no fixed address. The bitter irony that she prepares packages she could never herself receive is especially felt during the pandemic.
Nomadland,"Nomadland is a humanist masterpiece ... This is a quiet film, but never a dull one, with shots and themes that will continue to resonate ..."
Nomadland,"'Nomadland'is sort of a modern-day, existential equivalent ofWalden Pondset in the American West. The promise Chlo Zhao showed in'The Rider'three years ago is fulfilled here...with a little help from one of the finest actresses on the planet"
Nomadland,"Frances McDormand inhabits Fern... It's an earnest, grounded, immersive performance in a quiet movie that portrays ""flyover country"" as a landscape where independent spirits can still strike out on their own."
Nomadland,"Moody, introspective, and meditative, Nomadland makes up for its meandering, sometimes maddeningly slow pace with its insights about human nature and its incisive portrait of indomitability."
Nomadland,"Chloe Zhao, the Chinese-born director of this wondrous work of art (Oscar, please), joins with a never-better Frances McDormand and a cast of real-life nomads to capture what inspires the human urge to roam. It's a new American classic."
Nomadland,What results is a nuanced portrait of free spirits who reject a culture that has rejected them.
Nomadland,Nomadland is a meditation on the meaning and value of the concept of home: Does it reside in a building? A vehicle? A family? A sense of security and belonging?
Nomadland,A film so immersed in the iconography of modern Americana that it feels both like an evocation and stern rebuke of the paintings of Norman Rockwell.
Nomadland,"Somewhere, inside this lovely and desperate movie, there's the ghost of a Western."
Nomadland,"[Zhao's] movie gives a voice to the marginalised. If you listen hard, it might just change your life."
Nomadland,"The film takes place in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. But it might as well be in an alternate universe where no one speaks above a whisper and ""America"" remains a vaguely benign abstraction."
Nomadland,This is how the other half lives. The half that is most often neglected and growing in numbers.
Nomadland,"Nomadland is no stump-speech anecdote or soapbox sermon. It's too empathetic for that, too invested in the humanity of Fern and all those around her."
Nomadland,"At its heart, Nomadland is a road movie, but too many scenes feel stuck in neutral..."
Nomadland,Nomadland is a radiant celebration of humanity and community.
Nomadland,"A role and story drawn from life, ""Nomadland"" feels like classic fiction."
Nomadland,"McDormand's commanding, deeply empathetic performance holds the film together."
Nomadland,"This movie is worth seeing specifically for Frances McDormand's performance, the beautiful cinematography, and also for the real-life nomads that the film includes."
Nomadland,"The journey Zhao has crafted is marvelous, exploring literal peaks and valleys as well as emotional ones."
Nomadland,"Nomadland is a near seamless pairing of filmmaker and actor, the two working in delicate harmony as they trace Fern's loose, bittersweet trajectory."
Nomadland,Nomadland is both a move in a bolder direction and an affirmation that [director Chloé Zhao's] been on the right road all along.
Nomadland,Here's a beaut.
Nomadland,"It's an observant, simple, contemplative work, one uninterested in manufacturing melodrama or hyped-up incident, but rewarding for its illumination of Americans who represent societal afterthoughts."
Nomadland,"Nomadland at times has the feel of a documentary, but with none of the earnest flatness that mars even some very well-meaning documentaries..."
Nomadland,"[A] lean, sad, richly textured portrait of life on the American outskirts."
Nomadland,"McDormand, who is in every scene, makes Fern as tough at the plant she named for in that she adapts and survives. The actress gives a committed performance that will likely garner her an Oscar nomination."
Nomadland,"In writer-director-editor-producer Chloe Zhao's searing new film, Frances McDormand plays Fern with a quiet ferocity, ultimately delivering a gut-punch of a performance."
Nomadland,"By juxtaposing beautiful vistas filled with promise, a rotted social safety net, and the scrappy itinerant workers navigating the space in between, Zhao generates a gradually swelling tension underneath her film's somewhat placid surface."
Nomadland,McDormand is still finding the little-told stories that lead to impactful cinema.
Nomadland,A gorgeous film that's alternately dreamlike in the way it captures the beauty of this country and grounded in its story about the kind of person we don't usually see in movies.
Nomadland,"[Nomadland] is also a further refinement of Zhao's techniques, of the rough-hewn yet strikingly seamless weave of fiction and nonfiction..."
Nomadland,"The melancholy lyricism of Nomadland is something truly special, and this quiet marvel of a film deserves your attention."
Nomadland,A powerful character study of a different kind of freedom fighter.
Nomadland,For the making of the film - which she wrote as well as directed - Zhao immersed herself in this subculture and she immerses us too.
Nomadland,"The sheer compassion of Zhao's direction is one of the film's most elemental pleasures, while McDormand is one of those rare actors who can somehow make the act of listening as thrilling as a barnstorming speech."
Nomadland,"[Zhao] is fast becoming one of our premiere chroniclers of a certain kind of forgotten American: raw-boned, untethered, on the margins."
Nomadland,"The movie churns through a familiar saga of a woman who grows tired of her surroundings, but casts aside the pressure to conform to the traditional beats of that plight."
Nomadland,There is real greatness in Chloé Zhao's film-making.
Nomadland,"Watching ""Nomadland"" feels like gazing out on one long, gorgeous sunset. If that's not your thing, so be it, but for those on Zhao's wavelength, the movie is a marvel of empathy and introspection."
Nomadland,"Even if your time is running out, that view never will, it will continually unfold out from itself, multiplying the acreage within: ""Nomadland"" is a gorgeous, endless unfurling."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,For all the impeccable production values ... the films generosity towards its controversial heroine feels like an unwarranted canonisation.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"The film is a powerful indictment of America’s evangelical right, but the one thing that Chastain can’t quite do is to make Tammy likeable."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"The film smiles politely at Tammy Faye’s tacky aesthetic without ever fully embracing it, a bad-faith approach to its heroine."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"The Eyes of Tammy Faye has done right by its subject, but only at the cost of shrinking down her world."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"A riveting, unleashed and award-worthy performance from Jessica Chastain, playing a central character full of tensions and contradictions, is reason enough to see this film."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Usually biographies seek to peer behind the mask. Wish us luck, the movie winks."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"A film which feels uncomfortably like a shop window, flogging an unmissable three-for-one deal on acting, make-up and visual effects."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,On the whole... it’s just the ticket.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Despite some clear made-for-TV sensibilities whether deliberate or not The Eyes of Tammy Faye manages to be touching, informative and at times hilariously over the top."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Michael Showalter's film provides a fascinating insight into the world of its fiercely religious characters whose initial motives, to help the poor and needy, are compromised by the exploitative and greedy men who surround them."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,Jessica Chastain... gives a hilarious turn as Tammy Faye: like Tammy Wynette with a bit of Nancy Reagan and Eva Perón.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"It's an impressive performance from Chastain and a fascinating subject, but the film doesn't delve deep enough into Bakker's inner life."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,A big part of me wants to give The Eyes of Tammy Faye a hard time for being too nice.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Still, this exceptionally well-cast version of Tammy Faye's story does manage to tap into a cultural moment with reverberations we continue to feel today."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"While the resulting narrative feels disappointingly routine, the movie is worth watching for Chastain's makeup-caked and brassy performance alone."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"[Its] high points are only intermittent, owing to the particulars of the film's direction and the movie's deference to the conventions of the bio-pic genre."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Firing up the Oscar race for Best Actress, a virtuoso Jessica Chastain raises up this formula biopic about televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker by redeeming her reputation as a cultural joke in clown makeup and finding the soul beneath the sparkle."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,Most things I thought I knew about Tammy Faye Bakker were wrong. And I really enjoyed getting to know her.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"But although ""Tammy Faye"" may be imperfect, it does succeed in at least one significant way: We're not just looking at her makeup anymore."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Prestige biopics have a certain formula, and The Eyes of Tammy Faye follows it - to blandly redemptive results."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"It combines biopic, satire, and camp to no discernible purpose."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Jessica Chastain delivers an Oscar-worthy performance in the title role, and Andrew Garfield is nothing less than sensational as her soft-spoken, indifferent, and cloyingly ambitious preacher husband Jim."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,We're not meant to stare and laugh; Michael Showalter's film demands a fair reassessment of a stained icon.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"It's all very predictable, down to when and where the montages show up, the end-credits roll call of the real-life figures involved and how the arc winds its way toward a queasy, delusional yet somehow upbeat sense of redemption for our heroine."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"A dutiful, somewhat disjointed chronicle of how the televangelists amassed great wealth before his disgraced fall. While it's not a landslide vote, thanks to Chastain's disappearing act, ""The Eyes"" have it."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"The Eyes of Tammy Faye may have fake eyelashes in abundance, but it has no teeth."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"The Eyes of Tammy Faye succeeds only in presenting its subject as a camp curiosity, a one-woman pep rally for the Lord in linebacker shoulder pads, misunderstood and in need of redemption."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Portrayed in the media as a silly, helium-voiced nitwit with clownish make-up, here she is a vulnerable soul who wanted to bring joy and God's love for everyone."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,[A] patchy but glibly watchable movie.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Jones is as formidable as ever, and Vincent D'Onofrio gives a sombre and riveting portrayal of Jerry Falwell, the Baptist Savonarola, who doesn't hesitate to scythe down the Bakkers for their sins. But this is Chastain's movie, through and through."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"It is also a shame that The Eyes of Tammy Faye is too timid to critique its subject: her naive chase of glamour, her willingness to be part of a subsect that does more harm than good, and her obliviousness of the scam she took part in."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Jessica Chastain is the only reason, though a good one, to see The Eyes of Tammy Faye."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,The Eyes of Tammy Faye relies too much on Chastain's performance to pull its narrative weight. The movie seems to love its main character without bothering to understand her.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,There's no drama in a script that essentially says its oft-misunderstood subject was exactly who she said she was.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Is it a satire? A conventional biopic? The answer is it's a combination of both, and that's a problem."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" often feels superficial. It relies too heavily on calendar-page montages to tell its story; there are at least four, which is three too many."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"The Bakkers were many things to many people: appalling, inspiring, laughable, sad. This movie succeeds in making them dull."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Though Jessica Chastain delivers a heartfelt performance as Tammy Faye, her faith in the filmmakers can't save this drama from falling flat."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,The Eyes of Tammy Faye mostly plays out as a showcase for Chastain to bring as much emotional sturm und drang to the woman as she lurches between various states of turmoil.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" gives viewers an absorbing, amusing and provocative chance to rethink yet another train wreck who turned out to be, of all things, human."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,Abe Sylvia's ambitious but shallow script has something spiritually missing - namely a point to it all.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"She's a thrill to watch, and I hope Chastain doesn't have to wait another ten years until she can do something this grand and captivating again."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"It's best appreciated as a performance piece from an actress going all-in, but everything around that whirlwind of an acting turn feels under-considered."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"It wants to have Tammy Faye both ways: a charismatic voice of the people who was smarter than she looked, and a sweet naif innocent of the corruption that enriched her."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"While Showalter relishes the camp value of the film's costumes, makeup, and set design, make no mistake: This is a sympathetic portrait."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"Connoisseurs of performance gimmickry might be drawn to the Searchlight release, with its layers of prosthetic and digital disguise. But anyone requiring a fresh point of view or a reason to care should look elsewhere."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"For better or worse, we're on Tammy Faye's side, but the film often embraces the worst bits of a complicated story in order to make Tammy Faye look better. Why not make her look more real, makeup and all?"
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"A movie that feels both sweet and incomplete: a story as tenderhearted and inscrutable, for better or worse, as its muse."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"It held me every step of the way, but it has a prosaic, down-the-middle, one-thing-after-another quality. It's a bit long, with a final act that could have been better structured. Yet these two actors never let up."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"People called her a clown, but ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" shows her as someone more complicated and much more interesting."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,It's going to be tough not to worship at the altar of Jessica Chastain throughout this Oscar season.
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"It's clear that Tammy Faye was one of a kind. Chastain's mannered plague of tics does right by her in that respect, but she's been inserted into a template now worn from overuse."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"The Eyes of Tammy Faye's focus might be all over the place, but our eyes remain trained directly on Chastain."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"A fascinating and often heartbreaking exploration of accountability via a collision of passion, fame, fortune and the media with a show-stopping performance from Jessica Chastain at its core."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"What Eyes leaves out won't matter to the unfamiliar (Jessica Hahn is only referred to, not portrayed), but considering just how much has been packed into its two-hours-and-change, it's enough to render its subject in all her devotions and demons."
Land,I expected something interesting and artistic. I got something that looks nice but is utterly predictable.
Land,[A]ll the dilemmas here - from bear attacks to food shortages - are entirely free of jeopardy and simply exist to provide our director-star with another chance to stage swoon-worthy photo ops by the wood-burner.
Land,"Wright is sympathetic and believable, but we never truly get a sense of Edee or her desires outside the bounds of her loss."
Land,Its thematic intentions outweigh its technical shortcomings.
Land,"Land will give you a craving to be in the great outdoors, maybe before it's even over."
Land,"In her directorial debut, Robin Wright boldly strikes out for new territory, but the film is all too conventionally fenced in, lacking a narrative as compelling as its own dramatic Wyoming scenery."
Land,"It's a welcome touch of light-heartedness and it confirms Bichir's ability to make you care what happens next, no matter how far-fetched."
Land,"I wasn't really moved by this story, but I did respect it's granular, day-by-day storytelling."
Land,"When, in the final moments of the film, when the last piece of this very lovely looking landscape puzzle is placed, I couldn't help but feel that the film was a missed opportunity for something more intriguing, profound."
Land,Land is both a tribute to the triumph of the human spirit and an examination of the difficulties of setting aside modern conveniences for primitive survival.
Land,"Landis an impressive debut film from Robin Wright, and a damn good movie"
Land,Land is a perfectly enjoyable survivalist adventure. It also didn't leave much of an impression on me.
Land,"We eventually learn certain details about Miguel's life and I'll say no more other than this: For those who believe everything happens for a reason, nobody in the world was better suited to find Edee than Miguel."
Land,"Earnest, forthright and well acted."
Land,"Wright is relaxed and almost meditative as she takes in the beauty of the horizon, and her simple directing captures the majesty of nature."
Land,"Wright directs and stars in this simple but resonant story about a woman who finds personal salvation in a remote mountain cabin among a punishing, yet nourishing landscape."
Land,"Robin Wright has a grueling role in ""Land,"" and she has no one to blame since she cast herself."
Land,"The film's beauty is undeniable, but it remains a pictorial, surface-level kind of beauty, one that glosses over the muck and sweat of its protagonist's various second-act breakthroughs..."
Land,"While ""Land"" sometimes leans too hard on conventional signifiers (the rootsy music score is predictably somber), it's a distinctive, strong picture."
Land,"Yet by the time we reach Edee's big, cathartic disclosure in the last act, any sense of mystery or expectation has been wiped out by the film's blandly obvious trajectory."
Land,"There are corners of this quiet little film - less a plot-driven narrative than a two-person character study - that feel powerfully true, in ways that surprise."
Land,"Edee is played by Robin Wright, who not only makes us feel her pain but also makes an effective and visually lush directorial debut about a woman who seeks to lose herself, but against her wishes is found."
Land,The best I can say about Land is it sure is pretty.
Land,"The film's overtly non-specific title is surely meant to suggest some kind of pared-down elementality, but, in the end, it mostly just reflects the story's lack of definable character."
Land,"Despite pretty vistas and a typically watchable performance from Wright, Land proffers rather too tidy a reiteration of things the movies taught us long ago."
Land,"A smart, moving piece of work, hampered a bit by a rushed final act."
Land,"There's just not enough here to make it a worthwhile retread through familiar territory, proof of Wright's basic competency as a director but nothing more."
Land,Wright's moving performance and some genuine heart-felt and -breaking moments amid all this natural majesty make Land a journey worth taking.
Land,"""This isn't working!"" Edee screams at one point, floundering in the harsh winter. It isn't, exactly. But not for lack of trying."
Land,"Mourning takes all shapes, grief has no timeline, and pain is as personal, but ""Land"" grapples so uneasily with such heady topics that the result is the total absence of new insights."
Land,"[F]or anyone unable to leave the confines of their own home or neighborhood right now, ""Land"" offers simple lessons and stunning landscapes that may feel like a welcome balm."
Land,"So bless Wright for paring ""Land"" down to a beautiful haiku, and for delivering a performance that's ambiguous and understated in all the right ways."
Land,"Land, which marks Robin Wright's first time at the helm of a feature, poses some of life's starkest questions with a simple, elemental force, and with deep wells of compassion."
Aporia,"Aporia needn’t stay one step ahead of smart viewers to keep us intrigued and off-balance, glued to how these flawed, well-intentioned characters use their irrevocable power and face the consequences."
Aporia,"Light on the thrills and keen on contemplation, but it’s nice to encounter a multiverse that actually makes you think once in a while."
Aporia,"It’s a film that considers that life may be less about what you have or can get, and more about what you are willing to give up."
Aporia,A deeply silly time-travel weepie buoyed solely by the soapy warmth of its performances.
Aporia,"A bland sci-fi drama that asks too many unanswered questions about morality, mortality, and the price of happiness."
Aporia,"It’s never going to set the world on a new and unfamiliar course, but it does its job well enough."
Aporia,High-concept and heartfelt.
Aporia,"Aporia functions most compellingly as a kind of ethical family melodrama with a scifi twist, focusing the bulk of its attention on precisely how lives are impacted as a result of the tinkering with time that lies at the heart of its scifi premise."
Aporia,Will reward viewers seeking a thoughtful exploration of imaginative themes that usually come adorned in showier bells and whistles.
Finding You,"Even as an amorous daydream, ""Finding You"" is dated and generic, Disney Channel-movie-esque, but without the charismatic teen stars."
Finding You,Scores around six on the logarithmic PH scale - Paddywhackery Hazard - that leads from acceptable neo-realist films at one to the herb we won't mention again at 10.
Finding You,"Tiny specks of grit get entirely smoothed over in pearlescent sentimentality by the end, eased through by lashings of flute-and-fiddle noodlings on the soundtrack."
Finding You,"[T]here's not much here outside of glossy stargazing and fluffy daydreams, except for the exquisite greenery of Ireland. That's so real you couldn't fake it if you tried."
Finding You,"It's as if Finding You was written by a computer program that studied 2000s rom-coms, taking the worst tropes and clunkily blending them together."
Finding You,"A rom-com (with splashes of drama, care of death, cancer, and the price of celebrity, surely all stellar romantic hallmarks) that never met a contrivance it didn't love, right down to its winking take on ""Notting Hill."""
Finding You,"If you like rom-coms, this will win your heart."
Finding You,"But the film forgot to graft a personality onto its protagonist and seems so determined to be PG-clean that sparks between the leads are ... hard to ""find."""
Finding You,"A not-insignificant miscalculation aside, effervescent performances from an ebullient ensemble make Finding You a palatable and compelling female coming-of-age tale."
Finding You,"It would never work, Finley warns us, and it seems she might as well be talking about this cornball movie. But thanks to something ineffable... ""Finding You"" kinda, sorta does."
Dream Horse,"This is a small, sentimental and straightforward film that offers little in the way of surprises. Instead, it wins on heart and a simple message about the value in fighting to keep one's dreams alive."
Dream Horse,"""Hywl"" is a Welsh word that is described on-screen as a ""feeling of emotional motivation and energy"" - and Dream Horse has certainly imbued its likeable story with plenty of ""hwyl""."
Dream Horse,This is a character-driven movie and the horse is not the main character...
Dream Horse,It's a story with all the hallmarks of a typically British feel-good movie in the tradition pioneered by the Ealing comedies of the post-WWII years when the country needed all the laughs it could raise.
Dream Horse,The feelgood Brit-com is back!
Dream Horse,Shamelessly predictable and thoroughly feelgood.
Dream Horse,"What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in the sheer force of its sincerity."
Dream Horse,Its saving grace is a wonderful - and convincingly accented - lead performance by Toni Collette...
Dream Horse,"Dream Horse is predictable and manipulative to a fault but, sparked by Toni Collette, there is a strong sense of sincerity and commitment to the subject matter that helps it across the finishing line."
Dream Horse,"The resulting movie may be a bit schmaltzy - actually, a lot schmaltzy - but I couldn't help enjoying it: like Chariots of Fire, only with horses."
Dream Horse,I didn't find any great pleasure in seeing a story play out [the way] I knew exactly how it was going to play out.
Dream Horse,"It's super cheesy and formulaic, but it is also a total crowdpleaser. If you like that kind of film... I think it really fits the bill."
Dream Horse,"Poetic licence nudges forward backstories of marital strife, but the film's touch is deft. Likewise, the comedy of small-town eccentrics, rowdily played without tipping into snobbery."
Dream Horse,"Toni Collette is a sure thing in Dream Horse, a thoroughly predictable but ultimately winning underdog sports movie."
Dream Horse,"While there's nothing remarkable or surprising about this movie from director Euros Lyn and screenwriter Neil McKay, it's nearly impossible to dislike."
Dream Horse,"The racetrack tale's uplifting story, heartwarming moments and beautiful scenery pay off in a big way."
Dream Horse,"Sure it's hokey, but this fact-based crowdpleaser starring a terrific Toni Collette as a struggling Welsh villager who risks everything on a racehorse she breeds and raises is an underdog story that works like a charm."
Dream Horse,"Sit back, let your resting pulse rate slow to an easy Acorn crawl, and watch Collette and Co.'s sweetly scrappy dream come true."
Dream Horse,Watching the film navigate... clichés has a special satisfaction. It's like watching Dream clear the fences in the Grand National at Aintree.
Dream Horse,"It feels familiar because of its clichés, but it's a rousing enough story that those clichés don't hold it back from making an impact. Plain and simple, Dream Horse just works."
Dream Horse,"For all of its wry moments of humor, the film doesn't laugh at its characters so much as it delights in their newfound zeal."
Dream Horse,It's a sentimental movie but Lyn makes sure it never feels sticky or maudlin.
Dream Horse,"Doesn't rewrite the genre, but it's feel-good filmmaking of the sort many may be inclined to seek out at the moment."
Dream Horse,The real thoroughbred in the movie is the endlessly talented Toni Collette.
Dream Horse,"Dream Horse's kind spirit makes it watchable and fine, the kind of film meant for lazy days where low stakes dramas feel aptly comforting."
Dream Horse,"Just as Jan seemingly wills all the good fortune that comes their way, Collette keeps ""Dream Horse"" at a steady gallop, and Teale makes a terrific companion... It's a little like if ""Fight Club"" was friendlier, Welsh and equestrian."
Dream Horse,"""Dream Horse,"" an unabashed crowd-pleaser directed by Euros Lyn, earns its smiles and cheers."
Dream Horse,"""Dream Horse"" is a very nice movie, about very nice people, but nice is rarely enough, and thank goodness Toni Collette knows that."
Dream Horse,Its message is really about finding a reason to get up in the morning - and where's the harm in that?
Dream Horse,"""Dream Horse"" is well-made, compelling, even downright soothing."
Dream Horse,"However ingenuous, Dream Horse feels calculated to appeal to the type of viewer who will get up at the end and say, ""Well, that was nice, wasn't it?"""
Dream Horse,"Director Euros Lyn infuses the tale with a warm sense of humor and heart, thrilling emotional stakes and a deeply felt sense of Welsh pride."
Dream Horse,"Throughout, Collette makes us believe in the human-animal connection between Jan and Dream Alliance, which is touching, mysterious and deep."
Dream Horse,"After watching this Welsh racehorse drama, even those of us who'd struggle to pronounce the word may find ourselves feeling a bit of hwyl."
Dream Horse,The authenticity that Collette brings to a woman desperate for some kind of change and the willingness to seek it is inspiring. She's the real winner here.
Dream Horse,The kind of unabashed crowd-pleaser that was made with care.
Dream Horse,"Like horseracing, filmmaking is a high-risk gamblers' game, but the team behind Dream Horse, the resulting dramatization of the Vokes' story, have surely bred a winner with this endearing, determinedly crowd-pleasing adaptation."
Dream Horse,"A well-cast, artfully handled effort that exercises sufficient restraint to really earn its requisite laughter and tears."
The Girl Who Believes In Mi…,"For strictly faith-based audiences it's a perfectly fine story, as long as children are made to understand it describes an instance of higher powers demonstrating what extremely rare individuals, with MASSIVE amounts of purity and faith, are capable of."
The Girl Who Believes In Mi…,Faith based film that touches the heart.
Pig,ERROR
12 Mighty Orphans,"Who could resist a Depression-era sports drama involving Texas orphans and a gentle, do-gooder head football coach named Rusty Russell?"
12 Mighty Orphans,"It's an up-from-struggle story tailor-made for an old-fashioned, family-friendly, earnest, feel-good movie, and that's exactly what Roberts delivers,"
12 Mighty Orphans,"12 Mighty Orphans and 1,200 not-so-mighty clichés."
12 Mighty Orphans,"""12 Mighty Orphans"" tries so hard to be inspirational that it trips itself up on its way out to the field. Great story, but the telling is second-string."
12 Mighty Orphans,"""12 Mighty Orphans"" is a feel-good football film. It's just not very good. But at times, it is good enough."
12 Mighty Orphans,"Nothing that happens in ""12 Mighty Orphans"" is unexpected, but these two pros still react with infectious wonder as the messages they send to their students take root and then sprout."
12 Mighty Orphans,A plodding football drama in which the characters talk to one another like folksy social workers.
12 Mighty Orphans,"""12 Mighty Orphans"" manages to subvert a few of the expected clichés to reasonably original effect, and the ensemble of lesser-known young actors is across-the-board strong."
12 Mighty Orphans,"If you're looking for an old-fashioned sports drama, this is it."
12 Mighty Orphans,"Even though there are moments of intense emotion and struggle, Roberts maintains a quiet, deliberate tone."
12 Mighty Orphans,The story proceeds in expected melodramatic fashion.
12 Mighty Orphans,"Not a fan of football, but a fan of overcoing adversity , which is exactly what this ""dirty dozen"" orphans accomplish under the guidance of Rusty Russell. It's a feel good story delivered at exactly the right time"
12 Mighty Orphans,"Football fans, or those longing for bygone days of old timey sayings and men with conventional character, may find enjoyment in the film's spelled out structure. Others will be at the mercy of its barrage of inspiration, devoid of insight."
12 Mighty Orphans,"The script is littered with misogynistic locker room talk, from the use of ""ladies"" as an insult, to immediately objectifying Vinessa Shaw, who plays Russell's wife Juanita, as soon as she appears on screen."
A Journal for Jordan,"Adams is a vivacious screen presence with a twinkle in her eye, and Jordan can't quite match her, unable to draw out any real inner turmoil in a character who is respectable to a fault."
A Journal for Jordan,"The chemistry between Jordan and Adams never gels (Charles appears slightly annoyed by Dana throughout), and there are a plethora of superfluous scenes that simply die on camera."
A Journal for Jordan,A Journal For Jordan is probably better suited to the page than the screen.
A Journal for Jordan,"Visually, the style is basic. Under the surface the movie has complexity enough to handle a story whose timeline - a zigzag of points between 1998 and 2018 - is just one potential tangle."
A Journal for Jordan,Uninspired and ultimately forgettable.
A Journal for Jordan,"Director Denzel Washington and his stars do their best with this bland, shallow and awkwardly structured film."
A Journal for Jordan,"It's well told, tidy, and laudable."
A Journal for Jordan,"The personal voice Canedy provided in her memoir that made her book so thoughtful, so memorable is missing."
A Journal for Jordan,"Adams and Jordan have a warm, engaging connection on screen, and there is a surprising but welcome touch of humor as their romance develops."
A Journal for Jordan,"Its elements of posthumous, loving advice and inevitable tragedy make for good bones. But this portrait is too clean, too unquestioning, too accepting, to get to the marrow."
A Journal for Jordan,"Denzel Washington directs this adaptation (the screenplay is by Virgil Williams) with care, respect and a deep-seated knowledge of the Black love stories that don't make it to the big screen nearly enough."
A Journal for Jordan,"Apart from the frisky frissons sparked by the actors from time to time, this one feels very rote, a job of work rather than a creative and illuminating revelation of an unusual relationship between two emotionally alert people."
A Journal for Jordan,"The film is earnest, if also a bit slick, though not so much as to keep it from being affecting. Expect to shed a tear, or two, at its conclusion."
A Journal for Jordan,Feels particularly dated and often times emotionally cloying.
A Journal for Jordan,"""A Journal for Jordan"" is sentimental and well-intentioned, but it just can't quite pull things together in the end."
A Journal for Jordan,"Washington earns his audience's tears with an unrushed, unshowy style, letting an adult and very human relationship evolve on camera, skipping back and forth through years as it goes from love, birth, death and acceptance."
A Journal for Jordan,"There are three different movies packed into Denzel Washington's A Journal for Jordan, and none of them are very good."
A Journal for Jordan,"Even scenes in which [Jordan] saunters around shirtless, spontaneously starts doing pushups or flashes a coy smile aren't enough to keep one fully engaged in A Journal for Jordan."
A Journal for Jordan,"The movie is too tidy to ever really feel like a living, breathing thing."
A Journal for Jordan,"It trades in cloying sentimentality and romance, the gooey melodrama done no favors by Washington's stiff, anonymous direction."
A Journal for Jordan,"Back in the 1980s, it would have been right down the middle of the plate. Today, it seems like a film out of time. But that's not necessarily a bad thing."
A Journal for Jordan,"A bafflingly subpar melodrama boasting the quality of a made-for-TV movie in its writing, acting, and cinematic flair."
A Journal for Jordan,"The film fails to adhere to this very basic storytelling conceit, as Williams' script soon opts to unpack a fraught romance that few people would feel comfortable sharing with their offspring."
Boogie,"With so much on the line, Boogie just sort of dribbles to nothingness."
Boogie,"Writer/director Eddie Huang's flawed feature does have flashes to recommend it, particularly in depicting matters of the heart between Boogie and a no-nonsense Black classmate."
Boogie,"I really wanted to like this movie, but honestly it's really tedious."
Boogie,The story of a Chinese American kid's hoop dreams is hard to enjoy when the depictions of the game are so wrongheaded.
Boogie,Boogie is at times unpolished but it offers a compelling and sympathetic portrayal of the title character and avoids excessive melodrama or a too-facile ending.
Boogie,"Whatever desire to get real that the film was born out of, it ultimately feels like a sign that it's time to do some growing up."
Boogie,"Huang's voice and point of view are sharp, and once his storytelling catches up, it'll be cause to boogie."
Boogie,]This is a film that makes you appreciate just how useful genre can be.
Boogie,"It may not come together as perfectly as Boogie's ode to beef and broccoli, but it's food for thought."
Boogie,Eddie Huang's coming-of-age sports drama uplifts the Asian American struggle while falling into the same othering it purports to despise.
Boogie,"While ""Boogie"" has much of Huang's urban Asian American style and swagger, the script is, unfortunately, a missed shot."
Boogie,Huang's introductory effort exhibits ambition and energy but ultimately doesn't look ready for the big leagues.
Boogie,"It's a competent movie, but it doesn't quite make it to the big leagues."
Boogie,"While Huang's approach to the characters and their interactions feel fresh and personal, the entire basketball plot is cobbled together from countless sports-movie clichés."
Boogie,"In basketball terms, it's not just that Boogie's a star player who never passes the ball. He also rarely shoots. He mostly just stands in one place, listlessly dribbling."
Boogie,"""Boogie"" has some hops. But its all-around game could use a little work."
Boogie,"""Boogie"" is a sometimes-fascinating film about the pull of culture and family on a teenager trying to figure out his complicated life."
Boogie,Boogie's got personal vision and swaggering flair to spare - Huang wouldn't have it any other way.
Boogie,The film's characters hardly possess a sense of a history or an interior life to adequately convey racism's psychic toll.
Boogie,"Eddie Huang's directorial debut about a Chinese American basketball player trying to balance athletics, romance and parental expectations compensates for its narrative shortcomings by conveying a strong sense of its milieu's culture and customs..."
Boogie,"It's a familiar setup approached from a less-than-familiar angle, and ""Boogie,"" ambitious and clumsy by turns, cycles rapidly through the conventions of the teen sports melodrama, with an eye toward fulfilling some and subverting others."
Boogie,What Huang accomplishes with Boogie is a welcome addition to a growing canon of mainstream North American films created by and starring Asians.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Gifted as Hampton was with rare oratorial skills, the film on his life also tries to spin magic with his words..."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Impressive, explosive and gut-wrenching."
Judas and the Black Messiah,It all adds up to a gripping drama...
Judas and the Black Messiah,"This is a film made with a sense of outrage; although the events occurred so long ago, the ramifications that they led to are clearly still being felt in the US."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"As a political statement, Judas is powerful, a quite relevant revisiting of an American past that, as William Faulkner would have observed, isn't even past."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Kaluuya is terrific..
Judas and the Black Messiah,"The ""big picture"" question of the Panthers' political aims, and what relevance they might have for today, is not so fully explored. But taken both literally and as a parable, the film says a good deal about how society forces people into roles."
Judas and the Black Messiah,It ends with the terrible mess through which we are all still living. A thrilling picture. But also a sobering one.
Judas and the Black Messiah,The movie is a knockout - a 40-proof tragedy.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a film whose focus on racial politics and the horrors of corrupt power are no mere history lesson, but a strong, emotionally compelling tale of humanity with an urgent contemporary message."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"King has pulled off the near-impossible, taking a story of an anticapitalist civil rights martyr who we know will have a tragic, bloody end, and approaching it with daring and confidence."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Despite impressive performances, ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" has very little to say."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"For a film marked by so much bloodshed and death, Judas and the Black Messiah repeatedly takes the care to avert its gaze to the survivors, understanding them as victims, too."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"""Hampton and the Black Panther Party were always heroes to me; this is a film that does justice to their memory."""
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Both of the main stars are significantly older than their characters, since Hampton died at the age of 21. That's a forgivable bit of license, given the intensity and magnetism that Kaluuya brings to the secondary role."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Judas and the Black Messiah can't do everything. What it accomplishes is nevertheless quite something. It is a bittersweet compliment to what's here that we end the film wishing it'd done even more.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Through King's masterful storytelling and Kaluuya's and Stanfield's stunning performances, viewers learn why the Black Panther Party... was subject to the most aggressive targeting by the FBI."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Uneven methodology robs Judas and the Black Messiah of the propulsive energy it could have... by viewing [Fred Hampton] primarily through the lens of his detractors rather than his champions, he's guaranteed an uneven execution."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"It's a balance reflective of King's film overall. ""Judas and the Black Messiah,"" resurrecting a painful saga of police racial injustice, is a self-evidently timely film without stating its contemporary resonance literally."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Judas and the Black Messiahis a provocative movie title and the film that bears it lives up to the expectations it generates
Judas and the Black Messiah,"A glorious tribute not only to bravery and passion, but also to the poetry of revolution, where words and action collide to create something powerful and profound that cannot die."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"William O'Neal wrote his own tragedy, and Stanfield breathes life into it here, a confused, twisting spirit forever trapped in a hell of its own making."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Shaka King's film about the pursuit and assassination of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton is at once an intimate character study and a propulsive commentary.
Judas and the Black Messiah,With knockout performances comes an examination of the need for revolutionaries when pushing for real change.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Stanfield nails the role of the betrayer whose actions are tinged with greed, fear and, yes, love."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Bill is so slippery and has so little sense of self... that there's almost no self at all.
Judas and the Black Messiah,Shaka King's powerhouse about the 1969 murder of Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton (an Oscar-worthy Daniel Kaluuya) by Chicago police with the help of an FBI informer (Lakeith Stanfield) is a new movie classic that speaks to its time and ours.
Judas and the Black Messiah,[An] outstanding historical thriller
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Although King's film may not accomplish everything it sets out to do, it represents an important perspective of a time period whose essential injustices have gained renewed attention some 50 years later."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"But the stirring story, exceptional performances, and the score from Craig Harris and Mark Isham make this a powerful, important film, well worth seeing and learning from."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"A powerful, and candidly sympathetic, political biography with contemporary relevance, and a morality tale set forth as an exciting action adventure."
Judas and the Black Messiah,What an exciting talent King is.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"The star of the movie is Stanfield, an actor playing a character who's essentially an actor."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Letting his talented cast lead the way, King has made a film centered on roiled emotions and relationships that are at once fractured and loving."
Judas and the Black Messiah,The movie mourns what might have been and nags with what we'll never know.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"The script, by King and Will Berson, is layered with ethical snares and ideological paradoxes, and while King's fast-paced direction doesn't spare the suspense, it also makes room for sorrow, anger and even a measure of exhilaration."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Stanfield and Kaluuya are outstanding in their respective roles, with Kaluuya doing an especially adroit job of capturing Hampton's innate charisma and soaring speeches."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"King, in his feature debut, serves up an ugly if little known chapter of American history, as well as a lesson how unrepetant racism and out-of-control authority make for a tragic combination."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"With Judas and the Black Messiah, King has made a thriller that speaks to history without feeling didactic, that keeps the audience in suspense even though the ending was written decades ago."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a stunning feature debut from director Shaka King, and it would be worth watching for the performances alone. But it also takes an innovative approach to the story."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" quietly announces its modern relevance by presenting as sophisticated a depiction of systemic racism as you could hope to see in a movie."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"King's dual focus and stylish cinematic approach makes for a biopic that is at once rousing, maddening and desperately tragic."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Both an acting showcase from some of the finest actors working today and a necessary reckoning with the past, Judas and the Black Messiah is what we mean when we say timely and urgent."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"The film is mainly a collection of sketch-like scenes; the protagonists are given traits in lieu of depth, and the results are informative but unenlightening."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Shaka King and the production team have done a stellar job of plunging us into the tinderbox that was late 1960s Chicago, when the city was in the national spotlight far too often for the wrong reasons."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Courage, deceit and rage are displayed in powerful performances by Stansfield, Kaluuya and Dominique Fishback as Hampton's wife."
Judas and the Black Messiah,What we're left with is a historically accurate and mostly powerful portrayal of what could've been the greatest Black leader of our time.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Daniel Kaluuya provides a towering: all coiled power, oratorical savvy and meticulously-researched authenticity."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"""Get Out"" alums Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield magnetically reteam for Shaka King's potent true story..."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Daniel Kaluuya gives an electrifying performance that raises the hairs on the back of your neck.
Judas and the Black Messiah,Judas and the Black Messiah brings a sense of urgency to Fred Hampton's efforts as it tells his story. It informs on key events of the past while making you feel like it's possible to do something with that history to change the present.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Buoyed by a trio of standout performances, this freshly resonant thriller brings urgent life to one of the Black Panther movement's greatest tragedies. Shaka King is a force to be reckoned with."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Electrifying, urgent, life-changing cinema."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Though it's early in the year, it doesn't feel like a stretch to name it one of 2021's best films."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"The story is infuriating - not in the way King presents it, not at all, but in its details. The manipulation of justice is heartbreaking."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Shaka King's film, anchored by two sterling lead performances, complicates the expected narrative of martyrdom."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Director Shaka King doesn't employ cheap camera tricks or choppy edits to explain how this all went down. He lets the rawness of the story speak for itself.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" may stir the pot some, and I'm glad. The vividly wrought history feels like the present, and the actors seize the day."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Judas and the Black Messiah is a classic paranoid thriller turned inside-out - a nerve-wrenching conspiracy movie that ends up closing in on one of its conspirators.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"More than anything, what Judas and the Black Messiah presents is a full tapestry of a young man who was truly for the people."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Ultimately, this is an electrifying ensemble piece, its sorrow and outrage resonating over the postscripts detailing the personal and legal outcomes."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Judas and the Black Messiah is missing that deeper personal aspect, some sense of the emotional force yoking O'Neal and Hampton together, dragging them toward ruin. The film is resonant regardless."
Judas and the Black Messiah,The powerful film puts the current moment into fresh historical context and suggests that ambivalence can its own form of betrayal.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Judas lands all the harder framed as a story about us, rather than one about gods from on high."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"If anything, the fact that this film feels enervating and relevant 50 years later speaks to just how right Hampton was. You can kill a person, but you can't kill an idea."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"What makes ""Judas"" stand out is an emphasis on the personal aspects of a true revolutionary who tried to empower others for the greater good while unknowingly facing subterfuge from within."
Judas and the Black Messiah,Daniel Kaluuya is simply electric.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"As such, cinema is part of a cultural warfare without bloodshed, in turn making the stories portrayed, and how they are portrayed, inherently political. And if cinema is political, Shaka King has made a manifesto."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Mostly, though, it's Kaluuya and Stanfield - two actors who seem destined to be hailed for career-best turns with every subsequent project - who make ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" such an incendiary watch."
Judas and the Black Messiah,It's a powerful tale of human frailty.
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Black Messiah's center of gravity has to be a Hampton you can't look away from, and Kaluuya - alternately raw, tender, and incendiary - duly electrifies every scene he's in."
Judas and the Black Messiah,"Memorialized for his tragic death, [Fred Hampton] is reclaimed here as a figure of boisterous, defiantly big-hearted life."
Licorice Pizza,... As perversely delicious as its title.
Licorice Pizza,"Really stands up alongside (Anderson’s best work). It feels authentic for the time, and gives us a new star in Cooper Hoffman"
Licorice Pizza,"Licorice Pizza, like Phantom Thread, is a study of magnetic human connection that isn’t necessarily good for either party — but then, magnetic human connection rarely thinks that way, or thinks at all."
Licorice Pizza,"It’s a joy, and the sort of film that like a great LP -- it’s named after a Californian record store -- you’ll want to play over and over."
Licorice Pizza,"Theres a looseness a dreaminess, an illogic to how it all unfolds and meanders that is somehow still incredibly authentic."
Licorice Pizza,"The two leads, musician Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman, each in their feature film debut, are remarkable."
Licorice Pizza,"Licorice Pizza takes an arm's-length embrace of nostalgia. Anderson doesn't turn a blind eye to reality-he heightens it, weighting it with meaning, reflecting the romance of hindsight and adolescent abandon."
Licorice Pizza,"One thing I really like about this movie is the way it's structured, because it's meandering and it's loose [but] all these little moments, they feel like stories and anecdotes and memories that have been told and recounted many times."
Licorice Pizza,"Anderson and Haim, with her sharp-elbowed and funny yet soulful performance, capture the flailing, directionless condition of being a woman in her mid-20s."
Licorice Pizza,"This is a film carried by two people who've basically never acted before, but Anderson somehow knew that they could, and neither hits a false note in over two hours. It's a star-crossed love story à la Harold and Maude minus the tragedy."
Licorice Pizza,This film - which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture - will command a second (and third) watch.
Licorice Pizza,"Gary is played by Cooper Hoffman, the teenage son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman -- and he's captivating, full of chutzpah and with such a good, imperfect, real face."
Licorice Pizza,"Like any LP worth its salt, this is one where you'll want to be dropping the needle on over and over again."
Licorice Pizza,"The twists and turns in the script seems desultory. That is, until you realise the whole point of Licorice Pizza is to demonstrate that most heterosexual adult males suck."
Licorice Pizza,"This is heady stuff, an evocation of the San Fernando valley in the early 70s, as personally nostalgic as George Lucas's American Graffiti, albeit with an insanely adventurous edge."
Licorice Pizza,"The fullest expression yet of a certain kind of narrative antipathy that has crept into Anderson's toolkit and almost overwhelmed his last outing, the frequently dreadful Phantom Thread."
Licorice Pizza,One can scarcely imagine a more enjoyably chaotic way of welcoming in the new year. What a blast.
Licorice Pizza,"Such is the energy Anderson whips up, forever sending in chaos from the edge of the frame. The result is a giddy freewheel in which scenes never end how you or the characters expect, and what's coming next is anyone's guess."
Licorice Pizza,"The things in Licorice Pizza that are so good, like the performances from Haim and Hoffman and Cooper and the period fidelity, make you wish that the entire movie was just as good."
Licorice Pizza,"Looser and funnier than his recent efforts, sharper and more formally assured than his earliest films, this is Paul Thomas Anderson operating at full capacity. A master at work."
Licorice Pizza,There is a heady optimism about Licorice Pizza that is often missing from Anderson's earlier films. My
Licorice Pizza,"I had fun watchingLicorice Pizza,an all-too-rare quality that no other year-end release can match. For that I am grateful that someone wrote Paul Thomas Anderson a blank check to make such an idiosyncratic, highly personal film."
Licorice Pizza,"'Licorice Pizza' has an openness and vulnerability that's closer to his early work, specifically to 'Magnolia,' and its willingness to swing for the emotional fences in a way his later films might not."
Licorice Pizza,I wish there were more movies like this.
Licorice Pizza,"Anderson captures the frenzied feelings of teenage affection. It's a fleeting thing in the long run, but that doesn't make it any less real."
Licorice Pizza,An instant classic that brings out the best from some old pros and the brilliant newcomers Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim.
Licorice Pizza,It's the most fun I had at the movies all year.
Licorice Pizza,"The strange and challengingly charming awkwardness of Alana and Gary, as well as the more entertaining anecdotes, will get you past the somewhat lumpen structure."
Licorice Pizza,"It might be most rewarding to view ""Licorice Pizza"" as a dream: It doesn't always add up, or even go anywhere in particular. But it makes its own kind of offbeat, freewheeling sense."
Licorice Pizza,"""Pizza"" is unlike most coming-of-age comedies, reflecting the good and the bad of the times without ever preaching. It's filled with a sense of brutally honest nostalgia."
Licorice Pizza,"Neither Haim, a member of the band Haim, nor Hoffman, the son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, have acted before."
Licorice Pizza,"Watching ""Licorice Pizza"" is simultaneously like watching life with all the boring parts cut out and like watching movies with all the phony parts cut out. I can't even guess how anyone could do both things at once, but Anderson did it."
Licorice Pizza,"Watch the best film of 2021 wherever and whenever you can, and be thankful there is still plenty of beauty in this world to go 'round."
Licorice Pizza,"Anderson is going backwards to the terrain of Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love, but now with the maturity we see in his recent work, as if he's hanging his own growth as a filmmaker onto this story."
Licorice Pizza,"With shades of Robert Altman's freewheeling spirit, 'Licorice Pizza' gains momentum as its ambles along, resulting in Anderson's gentlest, most endearing picture to date."
Licorice Pizza,"The notorious control freak Paul Thomas Anderson has loosened the grip on his phantom threads and delivered a transcendent, free-flowing trip through his past..."
Licorice Pizza,A meandering nostalgia trap...Paul Thomas Anderson's latest movie makes the 1970s dreamy but lacks the edge of his earlier films.
Licorice Pizza,"Behind each scene, there's a smile and a shake of the head -- an acceptance that the good times are behind us, and that that's a fine place for them to be."
Licorice Pizza,"""Licorice Pizza"" is a film of immense, swirling complexity, and its elaborateness... comes off as a sort of defiance, of resistance to current modes of easy and consumable viewing."
Licorice Pizza,"It's a fun film that I suppose will be even more fun for you if you either lived some of it, or lived around it."
Licorice Pizza,"There are two courtships unfolding in Licorice Pizza, and only one of them is happening on the screen. The other is between us and the movie. Guess who ends up punch-drunk and smitten?"
Licorice Pizza,"For the most part Anderson has delivered another highly entertaining movie, capturing a very particular time but also the enduring and universal nature of relationships developing in the most unexpected ways."
Licorice Pizza,"Anderson makes romances, even when they're not exactly romantic; he's always looking for what connects two people with a bond that seems etched by fate."
Licorice Pizza,"If the misadventures of Licorice Pizza have a moral, it escaped me -- but Alana's homesickness for teenagehood is a heady enough force to push the viewer along."
Licorice Pizza,The whole thing has an ingratiating summer vibe hanging over it.
Licorice Pizza,"It's the performances of Haim and Hoffman that most lend ""Licorice Pizza"" its authenticity."
Licorice Pizza,Quite possibly the year's best film - easily its most delightful surprise.
Licorice Pizza,"If it isn't able to offer a perfectly offbeat romance on the level of Punch-Drunk Love and Phantom Thread, it's not discardable, either."
Licorice Pizza,"It is, indeed, Anderson's happiest creation to date-blithe, easy-breathing, and expansive."
Licorice Pizza,"""Licorice Pizza"" is a movie you will cherish for a long time after the lights come up."
Licorice Pizza,"A shaggy, fitfully brilliant romp..."
Licorice Pizza,"An entertaining movie that, like ""American Graffiti"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" before it, captures youth in hilarious and poignant ways."
Licorice Pizza,"A tender, funny ramble forged in all the hope and absurdity of adolescence, one wild poly-blend rumpus at a time."
Licorice Pizza,"If Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Licorice Pizza"" doesn't make you happy, the trouble may be that you're clinically depressed, anhedonic or don't care for movies in general."
Licorice Pizza,"Licorice Pizza feels pleased with how casual and effortless it is, which is the exact opposite of being casual and effortless."
Licorice Pizza,"Anderson has harnessed all the thrilling, muscular techniques that are his directing trademarks as well as his affection for high drama as a writer and applied them to telling a story that's surprisingly sweet."
Licorice Pizza,"[Licorice Pizza] is anchored by the aesthetic meld Anderson has perfected in recent years, and by a pair of truly stunning debut performances that bring to life two of the most fully-formed, deeply complicated Hollywood characters in recent memory."
Licorice Pizza,Darkness stays on the edges of Hollywood town in Paul Thomas Anderson's screwball comedy explosion about the serious business of first love. Newbies Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman light up the screen in one of the very best movies of the year.
Licorice Pizza,"In large part thanks to its fresh-faced stars, the charming Hoffman and the wildly charismatic Haim, I'm hard pressed to think of a recent movie whose world I would have liked to stay in longer."
Licorice Pizza,"It's the hints of danger, employed like ghost notes in a shuffling rhythm, that lend the film its sneaky depth of feeling."
Licorice Pizza,Both leads are outstanding in their feature debuts.
Licorice Pizza,"Paul Thomas Anderson's sunniest movie yet, this San Fernando Valley palimpsest is so buoyant and bubbly, it practically floats off the screen."
Licorice Pizza,PTA's latest feels like a dream -- an opportunity to become completely enveloped by 1970s LA and the comfort and charm of an impossibly sweet story about growing up and finding love.
Licorice Pizza,"Over his brilliant, wandering career, Anderson has shown us plenty of scuzz and grime, alongside flashes of kinetic verve and primordial howl. But Licorice Pizza is, by some measure, his most deliberately pleasant film to date."
Licorice Pizza,"Licorice Pizza delivers a piping-hot, jumbo slice-of-life look at how it felt to grow up on the fringes of the film industry circa 1973, as seen through the eyes of an ambitious former child actor plotting how to follow up his early screen career."
Licorice Pizza,It's such a delectable film: I'll be cutting myself another slice very soon.
Licorice Pizza,"[Paul Thomas Anderson] has sifted through a haze of wildly embellished tales and half-forgotten memories -- and pieced together something that feels more concrete, more achingly, tangibly real, than just about any American movie this year."
Licorice Pizza,"A lived-in, even tangible, period experience -- you can practically smell the maraschino cherries in the cocktails and feel the shag carpeting beneath your feet."
Licorice Pizza,"In Licorice Pizza, time isn't something that keeps people apart -- it's the only thing that allows them to find each other in the first place. And this euphoric movie doesn't waste a minute of it."
Licorice Pizza,"Creating a character whose warmth and humanity are tempered by hilariously deadpan humor and prickly detachment, Haim makes one of the most exciting screen debuts in recent memory."
Licorice Pizza,"[Licorice Pizza] is irresistibly hard to pin down: you'd have to go back around 50 years, to the likes of Hal Ashby's Shampoo or Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, to find another that runs on a similar kind of woozy clockwork."
Belfast,"Whimsical in the most imaginative sense, their conversations make it very easy to give [Kenneth Branagh] the benefit of the doubt. If the reality was not like this, it should have been."
Belfast,"The film, with a soundtrack of mostly familiar but appropriate Van Morrison songs, is clearly a labour of love, and the final scenes are immensely moving."
Belfast,Kenneth Branagh's unabashedly feelgood memoir of growing up in Belfast as the Troubles erupted in the late 1960s suffers from a problem of perspective.
Belfast,I loved it.
Belfast,"The film is manipulative, and sentimental, and it does sometimes feel derivative... But it is also sincere, affectionate, involving and presses its buttons so deftly I welled up exactly as I was supposed to. At least three times."
Belfast,A twinkly-eyed childhood memoir - and rigorously fashioned to be an Oscar frontrunner.
Belfast,A syrupy memoir offering little insight into a turbulent time.
Belfast,"At its best, Belfast recalls Hope and Glory, John Boorman's 1987 film based on its director's own Blitz-battered childhood."
Belfast,"It lights up the dark, the way even now a fill-um can."
Belfast,"Branagh's theatrical career has made him expert in holding and moving an audience -- and, since this is a once-in-a-lifetime project, why not give it everything and embrace full sentimentality?"
Belfast,Slight but winning.
Belfast,"Possibly the most uplifting film ever made about a time of unending violence, Kenneth Branagh's Belfast comes with a bruised heart and an unquenchable spirit of optimism."
Belfast,"...both grand and intimate, gooey sweet and shockingly violent, life-affirming and cynical."
Belfast,"'Belfast' is not just a movie photographed in black and white, but a story told that way - the Troubles as coming-of-age narrative, a thing happening in the background while a young boy reckons with bickering parents and how to talk to girls."
Belfast,"One could fault Branagh, one supposes, for not painting a grimmer, more naturalistic portrait of his problematic birthplace, but his mission is not to recreate childhood as history, but rather as a highly selective source of one's artistic inspiration."
Belfast,"The director had a vision, it's shot well, and after a while you don't even notice it's a black and white film with the way it pulls you in..."
Belfast,"Branagh tries to pair his pint-sized protagonist's moments of joy with the harsh realities of living in a society coming apart. But in its carefully choreographed nostalgia, it is all too twinkly eyed to make much of an impact."
Belfast,"Gorgeously shot (Haris Zambarloukos) B&W footage, with exquisite lighting and ample portrait-like closeups, makes this memoir eye-catching and enchanting."
Belfast,"Belfast is Branagh's love letter to his family, his neighborhood, a way of life that doesn't exist any longer. It's neither complex nor rigorous -- nostalgia rarely is -- but it does leave a lump in the throat."
Belfast,"It's like Branagh is flipping through a family photo album, giving us curated glimpses of these relatives and their lives."
Belfast,Unquestionably one of 2021's most affecting motion pictures.
Belfast,"It will warm the hearts of a lot of people, including a lot of Academy voters. Is it the best picture of the year? A) Too early to tell, and B) No, but, really, it's fine."
Belfast,"I must admit I went away grateful for the professionalism involved, and touched by myriad images of my own. A vibrant but vexing experience indeed."
Belfast,There is something genuinely bold in giving a movie about Belfast in 1969 the warm glow of the everyday. It reminds us that life goes on.
Belfast,"All phasers are set to ""charm."" That's what this movie is."
Belfast,"Belfast is mostly a happy film, and sometimes a bittersweet one, and only occasionally a truly tense one. It's at its best in those joyful moments."
Belfast,"[Belfast] is a major change of pace for the man who was once dubbed ""the next Laurence Olivier,"" and easily the best thing he's done as a writer-director in decades."
Belfast,"It's a sweet and engaging movie, but one that sacrifices some profundity in order to faithfully capture the world through a boy's eyes."
Belfast,"Everything that works in ""Belfast"" keeps the movie's superficialities and lower-grade sentiment at bay - if not every step of the way, then at least every other step."
Belfast,"Much of the filmmaking is superfluous at best; cameras randomly peer up behind furniture, and it's possible more drones were used in this film than during Obama's presidency. It's amiable, even enjoyable at times, but that's about it."
Belfast,"The film is clearly a vanity project, focusing on Branagh's boyhood anxieties and reveries at the expense of a larger drama, but this is not to diminish its entertainment value."
Belfast,It's hard to resist the movie's affectionate energy.
Belfast,"A spellbinding, semi-autobiographical drama seen through the eyes of a child, this is a handsomely life-affirming tale overflowing in intimate insights and told with a delicate hand."
Belfast,"Branagh skillfully shows us the world through Buddy's eyes, though we understand more than he does. Sometimes that is amusing. Sometimes it is heart-wrenching."
Belfast,"Kenneth Branagh makes a masterful memoir of his tumultuous Irish boyhood....set during the Protestant-Catholic conflicts of the late 1960s, the film is both specific and universal, grand and intimate, sweetly romantic and shockingly violent."
Belfast,"I can't say that ""Belfast"" is especially good. But it is nothing if not careful."
Belfast,"Boldly filmed in black-and-white, Branagh wrings a heartfelt narrative from a superb cast, though the story stumbles somewhat when it strays from its youthful focal point."
Belfast,A fond if slightly glancing salute to Branagh's native land.
Belfast,"For its frequently painful contours, there's an abundance of pleasures to be had in ""Belfast,"" Kenneth Branagh's irresistible memoir about growing up amid the Troubles in Northern Ireland."
Belfast,"Branagh is aiming for sentiment and nostalgia, and he hits the mark."
Belfast,"It's like paging through a photo album of your youth and struggling to conjure any specific feelings about the images, even the ones you're in."
Belfast,"Branagh's remembrances may be idealized, but with ""Belfast"" he has written a charming, rose-tinted thank-you note to the city that sparked his dreams and the parents whose sacrifices helped them come true."
Belfast,"A messy, and sometimes glorious, blur."
Belfast,"""Belfast"" is made with love and love is at the center of Branagh's story- love for family, love for community, love for country."
Belfast,"Above all else, ""Belfast"" expresses Branagh's heartfelt appreciation for community and family, notably the love of two charismatic parents who manage to help everyone weather these best and worst of times."
Belfast,Belfast gets the job done when it comes to producing waves of emotion in the viewer.
Belfast,"Belfast is about the authentic feeling of family rather than the particulars. In this way, the movie lives or dies by the actors bringing that to life. Thankfully, Branagh's cast hits it out of the park."
Belfast,"Branagh has directed all kinds of movies over the past 30 years... It's perhaps appropriate, though, that his most personal film would also turn out to be his crowning achievement."
Belfast,"""Belfast"" is brief, tidy and lovely; a heartfelt story of family and home, and how where the former is, the latter resides."
Belfast,"What's known as the ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland began to heat up...in the summer of 1969...That is the dramatic backdrop for Kenneth Branagh's sublimely semiautobiographical and elegiac ""Belfast,"" a love letter to growing up in tumultuous times."
Belfast,"Branagh, as Buddy, bares his soul in ""Belfast,"" which richly rewards if you're willing to take this trip down memory lane."
Belfast,"The movie is full of riots and barricades, yet it feels most alive when it turns inward, to the consolations of home."
Belfast,"The film is not a masterpiece, but a memory box. Comforting, inviting, and one you won't mind keeping close."
Belfast,"It's a heartfelt salute from Branagh to his hometown, and what he loved there."
Belfast,"The acting is brilliant across the board, starting with Jude Hill; who really does seem like a nine-year-old Branagh and doesn't have a false moment on screen."
Belfast,"No wonder Kenneth Branagh's funny, touching and vital look at his own coming of age in turbulent Northern Ireland is the Oscar frontrunner for Best Picture. No movie this year cuts a clearer, truer path of the heart. It's his personal best."
Belfast,[Branagh's] most intimate and deeply felt film to date.
Belfast,"At its best, Belfast recalls Hope and Glory, John Boorman's 1987 film based on its director's own Blitz-battered childhood."
Belfast,It will nab an easy best picture Oscar nomination next year.
Belfast,"Love letters to the past are always addressed to an illusion, yet this is such a seductive piece of myth-making from Branagh."
Belfast,Works gorgeously as an idealised memory play.
Belfast,"The result is engaging, tender film-making which tugs at the heart-strings, spurred by a sympathetic cast and the young lead, newcomer Jude Hill."
Belfast,"With ""Belfast,"" Branagh has found a way to go back, and only a cynic would begrudge him that. All we can hope is that he feels more at home than we do in his city of lost dreams."
Belfast,"Belfast embodies cinema's ability to offer a kind of escapism, but up until its climax it plays like a retreat from reality."
Belfast,"Belfast is Mr. Branagh's love letter to his family, and seldom has a filmmaker given life to cherished memories with more tenderness or vivacity."
Belfast,"[Belfast] contains little dramatic momentum, and even less of a coherent visual language."
Belfast,The affectionate cine-memoir is rendered all the more effective on account of young discovery Jude Hill and its portrayal of a close-knit family crowded under one roof.
Belfast,"Branagh's most personal film is imperfect, but the emotion that it builds in the final section, as the family plays out a wrenching universal drama of emigration, is searing."
Belfast,"There are not enough platitudes to heap on the performance Branagh coached out of [Jude] Hill...his enthusiasm carries so much of the movie that whenever fear or sadness get the better of him, it feels more pronounced and heartbreaking."
Belfast,Branagh's genuine affection and nostalgia for his subject suffuse the movie; if only the misty romanticism of his story could match it.
Drylongso,Cauleen Smith’s overlooked DIY classic from 1998 is a potent examination of the power of art and love in the midst of social upheaval.
Drylongso,"Low-key yet capacious, Drylongso is an affectionate art-school razz; a study of female friendship; a reflection on gender, race, & violence; a murder mystery; and a portrait of Oakland. Among its many pleasures, it reveals the unexpected in the everyday."
Drylongso,"Smith braids politics, friendship and romance throughout “Drylongso.”"
Drylongso,Smith’s independent masterpiece...
Spencer,"In a breathless, headlong way, Stewart does a credible job, but she’s perched on the edge of hysteria throughout and the upbeat ending fails to alter the impression that she and Larraín have delivered a one-dimensional portrait of a victim."
Spencer,"Stewart was an unlikely but, it's now clear, ingenious choice for the role; she's going through such a period of pronounced anguish that the wrong kind of actor would have played the whole thing as overwrought, and ruined it."
Spencer,"By exhuming Dynasty Di from her saintly casket, Larraín and Stewart have done the world a great favor."
Spencer,Leave it to actor Stewart to save the day. Ninety percent of the time she brings the spirit and look of Princess Di back to earth in an eerily real performance that captures the spirit of Buckingham Palace's most rebellious daughter-in-law.
Spencer,"What must it be like for an actor to play a famous person, let alone one this impossibly famous? The challenge starts with resemblance, and Stewart gets Diana's wounded-deer manner, the sulky eyes, the slight tilt of the head."
Spencer,"A film that spends nearly two hours advancing already axiomatic notions-obscene opulence does not equal freedom; protocol is a prison-with easy ironies, weighty symbols, and portentous phrases."
Spencer,"There is an adult's bitterness and knowingness that gives her Diana more gravitas than Stewart's previous characters. What's more, especially in some of Diana's more iconic outfits (she had many), she really does look like her."
Spencer,"You mostly can't look away from Stewart, or help yourself rooting for Di to live happily ever after. Personally, I hope Oscar takes the bait."
Spencer,"We're in a time period where Diana has only about six more years on this Earth, but at least she was able to break free and hopefully experience a measure of happiness in the years after the imagined events of Spencer.."
Spencer,"It's beautifully shot, really well-acted by Kristen Stewart, and has a fantastic score by Jonny Greenwood that I've already decided is my favorite of the year."
Spencer,Spencer allows viewers to become the support system Diana so sorely lacked at the time...
Spencer,"Brilliant central performance. Sally Hawkins does a great job of taking this role, and turning it into a symbol of heartfelt love."
Spencer,"At times, the film is excruciating, albeit deliberately, and that works it its favor."
Spencer,I once wrote that Stewart had a narrow range and I have never been happier to eat my words.
Spencer,"In Pablo Larraín's dreamlike movie, Diana is not the people's princess but a woman in search of herself."
Spencer,"I never felt that the filmmakers were posthumously trying to cash in on Diana's celebrity. The fable-making, at least, is done with genuine commitment. Most of all, Stewart's fierce performance roots it all in reality."
Spencer,"The casting, with Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana, is brilliant, and the ending, in a top-down convertible, is sublime. So why is the rest of Pablo Larraín's Spencer such a hollow exercise in high camp?"
Spencer,"Spencer feels in every way like a companion piece to Larraín's Jackie, both mesmeric suites about women trapped in a gilded cage of politics, privilege, and intense media scrutiny."
Spencer,Kristen Stewart is so good as Princes Diana-it's the performance of her life-that the Academy should start engraving her name on the Best Actress Oscar.
Spencer,"Mood and ambience are no substitute for a compelling story, and ""Spencer"" doesn't tell us one."
Spencer,Who better to play a person remembered for her perceived shyness than the current maestro of hooded introspection?
Spencer,"Unbalanced and unjust, ""Spencer"" is nonetheless perversely gripping. It dares to unbend, playing the angry fool amid kings-to-be, queens, princes, princesses, and all that jazz."
Spencer,"Stewart, on the other hand, sells her character's state of mind. Her performance pierces the script's inclination towards melodrama."
Spencer,"[Spencer] calls itself a ""fable from a true tragedy."" It might also be called a fever dream, a surreal nightmare, a reductio ad tedium or just an inherently limiting concept that slowly but inexorably squeezes the life out of itself."
Spencer,"It's also a good film-a very good one, in fact-that frequently threatens to be great, but it seldom lives up to the weighty themes promised by its dialogue, and it comes achingly close to scaling the heights Kristen Stewart reaches with her performance."
Spencer,"Stewart both carries the film and the day. She looks nothing like Diana but is somehow Diana. I think it's called ""great acting."""
Spencer,"For all of Larraín's artistry, Spencer would crumble in the hands of the wrong actress, and Stewart gives one of the best performances of her career so far as this highly subjective version of Diana."
Spencer,"Like the jazz that permeates Greenwood's music, Spencer is a riff on Diana with Larraín and Stewart operating at the peak of their powers."
Spencer,"It's a historical fantasia, a claustrophobic thriller and a dark comedy of manners, all poised on a knife's edge between tabloid trash and high art."
Spencer,"It's weird, but it works. Just be prepared for one wild, sometimes out-of-control, ride with Stewart always showing a steady hand on the steering wheel."
Spencer,"""Spencer"" is more than the portrait of a woman in distress. If it's a fable, it's a political fable, an allegory of powerlessness, revolt and liberation."
Spencer,"You watch wishing this story, in the real world, could have had a different ending; and marveling at how Stewart finds new, close-to-the-bone layers in a character we thought we already knew."
Spencer,"There's more than one way to dramatize the public/private schisms of celebrity, and this way feels right for this director, this actress and this movie."
Spencer,"""A fable from a true tragedy,"" the opening text promises, promisingly. Yet Spencer is airless as drama, every bit as hemmed in by its schematic design as Diana is by her life in the blinding spotlight."
Spencer,"[Stewart's] interpretation of Diana is risky, but it is also the glue that holds this brilliantly odd and lavishly shot film together."
Spencer,"Rarely does a writer of movies put a stamp on a film like Knight does here, slipping grandly loaded lines into the mouths of not always famously articulate characters."
Spencer,"This an enjoyably strange spectacle, perhaps best appreciated by taking it less seriously than its creators intended."
Spencer,"The symbolism throughout is so heavy-handed as almost to impress in the end, for sheer bone-headedness."
Spencer,"Stewart is perfect as the angsty, tortured Diana, carefully captured by Claire Mathon's camera, bathed in cold English light."
Spencer,"""Spencer"" knows that Diana is headed on a tragic path. Its triumph is that it allows her one last joyride- rooftop down, arms in the air- to break free before the inevitable comes knocking."
Spencer,"Once you get past how Stewart captures Diana's look and spirit, there's not much more to see or learn."
Spencer,"The point of Spencer seems to be not to reveal Diana the real person, but to treat her differently in a cinematic sense - to recast her in a different kind of movie than the ones that we've already seen."
Spencer,The acting is outstanding all the way around. But Stewart is brilliant.
Spencer,"For better and for worse, ""Spencer"" conveys one thing quite powerfully: the feeling of living in a rarefied, indifferent world that doesn't seem to value independent women, much less people."
Spencer,"With a stellar performance from Kristen Stewart, director Pablo Larraín's supremely brilliant ""Spencer"" is an enlightening glimpse into the mind of Princess Diana that doubles as an effective horror film."
Spencer,"Though it doesn't ever make you really feel, Spencer is a bold, compassionate, poetic riposte to standard royal biopics. It also confirms Kristen Stewart as one of the most exciting actors working today."
Spencer,It takes one of the most promising screen actresses of her generation and casts her out to sea with nothing to hold onto but a hideous script that's all attitude without depth or understanding.
Spencer,I sobbed the whole way home.
Spencer,"Coupled with Stewart's exposed nerve of a performance, the suffocating intensity of Larraín's filmmaking, and Jonny Greenwood's droning score, the movie brings a fresh sense of tragedy and loss to a tale that might otherwise feel familiar."
Spencer,Stewart's uncanny magnetism-her ability to mesmerize the camera even in moments of stillness or repose-keeps it watchable even in moments of extreme silliness.
Spencer,"Larraín admits up front it's more fable than fact and, while he occasionally overreaches with his myth-spinning, his empathy and compassion for a woman suffering a mental breakdown are beautifully expressed."
Spencer,"The film is Stewart's to carry, and she does it by going less minimalist than is her habit and by allowing an awareness of the absurdity of Diana's situation to seep in, even as she plays the woman's suffering entirely straight."
Spencer,[It] gets to the meat of what was tormenting the People's Princess better than any simple historical retelling ever could.
Spencer,"Spencer is an act of psychological horror, a kind of ghost story, and a survivalist picture carried by an uncannily immersive Kristen Stewart, in the best performance of her career."
Spencer,"Stewart disappears into the role, but it's in the moments where she's allowed to be herself that Spencer rings true."
Spencer,Pablo Larraín's film readily conjures a paranoia-suffused atmosphere of fear for what might happen at any moment.
Spencer,"Showing how the dream of being a rich and beautiful princess curdled into a nightmare might sound like a hard sell, but Spencer pulls it off in heightened, claustrophobic and truly decadent fashion."
Spencer,"An empathetic, intelligent insight into the prison of fame and privilege, with Kristen Stewart offering a lead performance that is brittle, tender, sometimes playful and not a little uncanny."
Spencer,"Stewart does terrific work as this royal-turned-scream-queen, but one does get the sense that she could be even better were ""Spencer"" to allow the character to go as wild as everything else does around her."
Spencer,"Like the austere artwork in the Sandringham House, the film deserves to be framed and hung on a wall. Admire it, don't embrace it. Maybe that's the point."
Spencer,A haunting reimagining of a tense Christmas holiday in the life of Princess Diana.
Spencer,"Larraín turns this Diana into exactly the thing the royal family accused the real-life Diana of being, a willful and pouty constant complainer."
Spencer,Stewart is such inspired casting that she makes all this eccentric nonsense watchable.
Spencer,"Stewart's febrile, sensitive performance and Larraín's trademark lyricism give it an emotional kick that such predecessors lacked."
Spencer,"Its focus rests on its heroine alone. But what a heroine - and what thrillingly gutsy, seductive, uninhibited filmmaking this is."
Spencer,"All the right people are going to hate ""Spencer."" That's just how good it is."
Spencer,"It is often witless and banal, leaving Larraín and the actors to heroically milk the drama from a string of interactions that are either overstuffed with ""meaning"", or just deathly dull."
Spencer,"Stewart adopts the blonde bob, the Kensington clothes and the breathy voice but stops short of full impersonation and her performance is better for it."
Spencer,"At once a work of great sensitivity and high, hilarious camp, less interested in identifying the 'real' Diana than in building a living, breathing character."
Spencer,"The Princess Diana story is given an art house makeover in this infuriating mixed bag, one that veers wildly from moments of dreamy intrigue to risible scenes of camp."
Spencer,"Stewart's finely detailed work on the accent and mannerisms is impeccable. The camera adores her, and she has seldom been more magnetic, or more heartbreakingly fragile."
Spencer,"Unfurls in a torrent of ideas and madness, some of it brilliant, some of it quite silly."
Spencer,Larraín's approach to the material is rich and intoxicating and altogether magnificent.
Spencer,An enthralling drama of Diana's moment of truth and transition.
You Can Live Forever,This compassionate story of puppy love – co-written and codirected by the former Witness Sarah Watts – shows more understanding towards the community.
You Can Live Forever,"It’s got something of Jeanette Winterson’s tenderness, if not exactly the wit, and the movie is interesting and even faintly subversive in its implied analogies concerning conversion and enclosed behaviour systems."
You Can Live Forever,"Sweet, gentle, and understated."
You Can Live Forever,"It moves along at a rather slow pace and doesn't quite reach the emotional summation it was looking for, but it's commendable and worth seeing."
You Can Live Forever,Slutsky and Watts precisely capture how it feels for Jaime and Marike to be penned in by the obligations and expectations of their families and congregations.
You Can Live Forever,"As Jaime and Marike circle each other, at once exhilarated and agonized by one another’s company, this film lingers in the uncertainty of first love and in the nervous wonder of queer yearning."
You Can Live Forever,Mark Slutsky and Sarah Watts’s story benefits from being rooted in Watts’s own experience growing up gay in the 1990s.
You Can Live Forever,"Though the well-crafted film makes use of a unique regional setting for some moving moments, its straightforward approach to well-worn territory offers few surprises."
You Can Live Forever,"For all its aches and pains, the heart of You Can Live Forever doesn’t so much beat as skip, haltingly and disconcertingly, as it tries to keep its own lifeblood pumping."
You Can Live Forever,"While I will always appreciate and enjoy cheesy sapphic stories, this movie’s strangely quick pacing and rather shallow commentary left me wanting more."
You Can Live Forever,"A sweet debut and a welcome addition to the lesbian canon, neither fetishizing nor lamenting the romance between Jamie and Marike, but rather indulging them in their exploration and study of both each other and their relationship to those around them"
The Many Saints of Newark,"Alessandro Nivola is brilliant as Tony’s uncle, Dickie Moltisanti, an unstable explosive who didn’t feature in The Sopranos but whose story provides fascinating insights into characters such as Tony’s mother, Lydia (Vera Farmiga). Expect laughs too."
The Many Saints of Newark,"No doubt devotees of the series will have different opinions as to the value of this backstory, but seen in isolation, as an intense and sometimes violent story of a dysfunctional family, the film is richly rewarding in its own right."
The Many Saints of Newark,Newcomers to the Soprano saga will have no difficulty tuning in. The narrative soon begins to take on the classic lines of authentic tragedy.
The Many Saints of Newark,"The movie was, to borrow an image from the ""Pine Barrens"" episode, like sucking ketchup packets."
The Many Saints of Newark,"I walked out of the theatre wishing for a limited TV series rather than a movie. Although The Many Saints of Newark offers an alluring glimpse into Tony Soprano's birth under a bad sign, it never shows the blue moon in the mobster's eyes."
The Many Saints of Newark,"All of this is done well enough (although the late '60s and early '70s costuming feels a bit exaggerated, too on the nose) but it's certainly not enough to elevate this film to the level of The Sopranos."
The Many Saints of Newark,"As becomes almost immediately clear, there was no real reason for the movie to have been made, no inspiration for it that was not commercial."
The Many Saints of Newark,"As a ""Goodfellas""-ish crime drama that vividly evokes time and place, ""Saints"" is rendered with enough bare-knuckled verve, unpredictability, and darkly glinting wit to make it work."
The Many Saints of Newark,"This is something the fans of the Sopranos have been wanting, and as a fan myself of the series, I found it fascinating to see Gandolfini's son playing with subtle distinctions as an interesting performer..."
The Many Saints of Newark,Even a seasoned Sopranos viewer will never feel completely sure of where the story is going.
The Many Saints of Newark,"I like a lot about it, but it also feels like [David] Chase is trying to get an entire season of television into this two hour film."
The Many Saints of Newark,"It's a polished, entertaining film, but a lot of its meaning derives from how much the audience cares about a handful of TV characters they may or may not already know."
The Many Saints of Newark,"Heaven for ""Sopranos"" fans, though this is really less a prequel than a spin-off."
The Many Saints of Newark,"It's a very smart piece of work that, oddly, owes as much to the films of Martin Scorsese as to the world Chase built over six appalling, satisfying seasons."
The Many Saints of Newark,Reduces characters of potentially mythic power to a handful of defining traits and pins them to a diorama-like backdrop of historical readymades.
The Many Saints of Newark,"Even the pleasurable sight of Michael Gandolfini as young Tony was never going to make up for the complete absence, in this film, of anything remotely reflective of the tone and color of The Sopranos."
The Many Saints of Newark,"Go ahead, arrange a sitdown: This darkly funny and ultra-violent film perfectly depicts the 1960s times and voices that shaped Tony into a made man."
The Many Saints of Newark,The magnetic Nivola's Uncle Dickie pulls the movie's focus and overwhelms the coming-of-age saga that brought the gang -- and its many fans -- together in the first place.
The Many Saints of Newark,"Making bigger than life gangster feature films is an art that should be left to the pros (Scorsese, Coppola). Stepping out of its cable TV lane hasn't helped The Many Saints of Newark."
The Many Saints of Newark,"The creeping darkness of Many Saints of Newark has an effective build, an unnerving, pathetic portrait of past rot that would really only shift in clothing choices and locations to become the present tense of The Sopranos."
The Many Saints of Newark,"This big-screen prequel to 'The Sopranos,' with a touching Michael Gandolfini playing the teen version of the role created by his late father, is good, but not good enough to score as a great mob epic in its own right."
The Many Saints of Newark,"""Saints"" stands on its own but it's likely to appeal to fans of the series."
The Many Saints of Newark,"Two hours of reach exceeding grasp, a jumble of moments that often only toggle between the exasperating and repellent."
The Many Saints of Newark,"Although nostalgic by its very nature, The Many Saints of Newark rescues itself from schmaltziness by its focus on the impossibility of living out masculine ideals."
The Many Saints of Newark,"It's almost heroic how little Chase cares about making a Sopranos movie, but it inevitably puts the film at cross-purposes, with the story it wants to tell getting strangled by the one it's obliged to."
The Many Saints of Newark,"""The Many Saints of Newark"" might have played better as a limited series rather than a truncated self-contained production, with the potential for a deeper story to unfold over several impending episodes."
The Many Saints of Newark,"The film represents the same complex, layered story-telling as the series and stands alone as a powerful exploration of themes of nature and nurture, destiny and choice."
The Many Saints of Newark,Less a reminder of the brilliance of Sopranos mastermind David Chase and more an anguished warning against running back to the past for fear of disappointing the future.
The Many Saints of Newark,"The storytelling is rich and intoxicating, the performances are authentic and lived in and it's a treat to be back inside the worldof creator David Chase."
The Many Saints of Newark,"A movie that is fascinating to study and consider, but not nearly as good as the television series that made us wish for this movie to exist."
The Many Saints of Newark,One of the most entertaining films of 2021.
The Many Saints of Newark,"It's a tray of Carmela's ziti piled high with cannoli and gabagool, then drenched in espresso and red wine - a waste of its ingredients."
The Many Saints of Newark,"As movie spinoffs go, this one's fuller and livelier than, say, the ""Downton Abbey"" movie."
The Many Saints of Newark,"""The Many Saints of Newark,"" a busy, unnecessary, disappointingly ordinary origin story, doesn't work."
The Many Saints of Newark,Even a simple question about The Many Saints of Newark is damning: Would a non-Sopranos viewer bother watching it?
The Many Saints of Newark,"Chase has delivered something that walks the tightrope between social melodrama and fan service, and that sometimes teeters on the edge of falling."
The Many Saints of Newark,"So many things could have gone wrong with ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" the feature-film prequel to ""The Sopranos."" Some of them do. Happily, a lot more go right."
The Many Saints of Newark,"It's undeniably entertaining stuff, but this choppy collage-style portrait... is better suited to the needs of existing fans rather than those of Sopranos neophytes."
The Many Saints of Newark,Boasts plenty of its source material's brutal violence but little of its psychological weight or dynamic interpersonal conflict.
The Many Saints of Newark,"Woke up this morning, watched myself a film."
The Many Saints of Newark,"The whole purpose of this film is to play on the deep investment so many people have in this fictional world in their own lives. For some, such memories matter almost as much as those that are personal."
The Many Saints of Newark,The young Gandolfini... is a gamble paid off. He gives the film lifeblood.
The Many Saints of Newark,The film's only weakness is Chase's usual failing: he doesn't know how to end anything.
The Many Saints of Newark,We'll always have Pine Barrens.
The Many Saints of Newark,"Sinewy and smart, it's a rich imaginative leap into the pre-history of an iconic show, and a rare instance of the big screen doing right by the small."
The Many Saints of Newark,"If ""The Many Saints of Newark"" is divided against itself to a certain degree... the young Gandolfini brings such primacy to the character that every scene he's in feels naturally formative."
The Many Saints of Newark,"A busier proposition than its HBO forefather, this sets up more than it can pay off. But it does manage to balance fan-service with plenty of rich, original, complex material. Bada? Bing."
The Many Saints of Newark,Chase's characters and this material always satisfy just as they leave you ready for more.
The Many Saints of Newark,The Many Saints of Newark is more of a diverting footnote than an invaluable extension of the show's colossal legacy.
The Many Saints of Newark,"Unfortunately, what [Chase] comes up with in this over-plotted Sopranos prequel is much less interesting than what he planted in our heads over six seasons."
The Many Saints of Newark,"Saints can't be what Sopranos was - without the time or the ones who've been lost to tell it, fuggedaboutit. But for a hundred-something minutes, it feels close enough to coming home again."
The Many Saints of Newark,"The Many Saints of Newark is both instantly recognisable and somehow unplaceable. It's fierce and brilliant, too - a work that both expands on and complicates The Sopranos's cultural legacy."
The Many Saints of Newark,It's not Cruella goes to Jersey. It's so much better.
The Many Saints of Newark,"""The Many Saints of Newark"" turns out to be a credible and rewarding film. But with a bit more seasoning and time in the oven, like its HBO predecessor, it actually might have risen into a truly sensational TV show."
The Many Saints of Newark,"Casually important, traumatically enjoyable, The Many Saints of Newark is a tale of the unexpected that will cause cineastes, as well as life-long couch potatoes, to cry hallelujah."
The Many Saints of Newark,Watchable but weirdly obtuse with a tricksy narrative reveal that doesn't add much.
The Many Saints of Newark,"We want ""The Many Saints of Newark"" to spin a good yarn, and for the most part it does."
The Many Saints of Newark,"The juxtapositions between backroom politicking, intimate family drama, and the occasional lurches into action often give the impression of a TV season's worth of content crammed into two hours."
The Many Saints of Newark,It will make you want to break out your Sopranos boxsets and watch the whole thing from the start again.
The Many Saints of Newark,"The new characters are all one-dimensional, and we learn nothing new about the old characters from the series."
Cry Macho,"Nobody has turned getting old into a project like Eastwood has, the weariness deepening while the swagger fades like a mirage, leaving him frailer, more exposed and more recognisably human. But still Clint, still the myth."
Cry Macho,There's something touching about seeing the 91-year-old Eastwood in such a reflective mood.
Cry Macho,"Terribly dated, messy and more than a little rough around the edges."
Cry Macho,"Clint Eastwood's best movies have an elegiac quality - they are the films of an older man, full of regrets - and this latest effort from the 91-year-old screen icon is elegiac squared."
Cry Macho,The film's presence in 21st century cinemas is a marvel. It is like turning up at the ferry port to find yourself ushered on to a tea clipper. A rickety tea clipper.
Cry Macho,"This Tex-Mex drama about a retired rodeo star on a mercy mission has an intermittent dawdling charm. It's also slack and featherbrained - and set in the late 1970s, but you can barely tell."
Cry Macho,"Despite the casual air, nothing in Cry Macho is un-self aware. And Eastwood the film-maker is never more knowing than when dealing with Eastwood the star."
Cry Macho,"It's a Swiss cheese of bizarre plot-holes set in 1979, clearly because that is when it was conceived."
Cry Macho,"Eastwood's back with a look at manliness filtered through the wisdom of aging. It makes the odd stultifying stop and falls into several cliché potholes, yet Cry Macho ultimately finds its way."
Cry Macho,"Cry Macho finds its way ... turning into a fine drama that caters to Eastwood's strengths as an actor, director, and icon."
Cry Macho,"If the film's not Unforgiven, the fact that Eastwood's not stressing too hard and still adventurous is a virtue."
Cry Macho,"There's an unexpected benefit to [Eastwood's] frailty, and it makes this leisurely, not especially plausible film worth watching."
Cry Macho,An amiable road picture that never strays from its connect-the-dots predictability. But it does boast the best rooster you'll likely see in any 2021 movie.
Cry Macho,"But the worst dialogue is given to an unfathomable love interest, portrayed by Natalia Traven, playing a feisty widow... It's all pretty awkward. When the couple dance it looks as if she's holding up a frail Eastwood in case he falls."
Cry Macho,"The film achieves the nourishing simplicity of a fable, and its devotion to the quotidian elements of mythical small-town western life is nearly religious."
Cry Macho,"To say that he's making movies for the fans and not the critics would be inaccurate twice over, both because many of his fans are critics, and because he's only ever made them for himself."
Cry Macho,"As a director, Eastwood keeps his tone almost primordially simple; not for Macho are the murky moral calculations and defined character arcs of The Unforgiven, American Sniper, or even Gran Torino."
Cry Macho,"It's the sentimentality that makes the movie work; Eastwood has never shied from making a male weepie, and less so from rending the fact of his own age into a dramatic problem."
Cry Macho,"It's great to see Eastwood (and his stunt double) back in the saddle in a few scenes in which he breaks some wild mustangs and teaches Rafael how to ride, but Cry Macho has us crying uncle long before the underwhelming conclusion."
Cry Macho,The veteran actor-filmmaker's latest pays homage to his on-screen persona while deconstructing it.
Cry Macho,"As a director, Eastwood is known for his slow hand and unfettered approach... In this case, slow pacing --bordering on slow motion -- and a desire not to complicate things works against the narrative."
Cry Macho,The story is almost embarrassingly simple. But the picture slides by pleasantly enough like a stream in a Budd Boetticher movie...
Cry Macho,"This meandering neo-western is far from classic Eastwood, but even at 91 actor-director-legend Eastwood is still classic in every sense of the word."
Cry Macho,Living at 91 never looked so good.
Cry Macho,"The film, for all its endearing oddities, suggests that old doesn't need to be cured, only worked through with as much grace and equanimity as possible. And as much verve as available."
Cry Macho,"An understated, uneventful slog of a movie that feels like a misguided merger of Gran Torino and Bronco Billy. Blame many of the problems on a woefully weak script, but this largely two-character road movie never really gets out of park."
Cry Macho,Eastwood's grit is still intact but here it's in serviceof a so-so story full ofunearned emotions.
Cry Macho,"""Cry Macho"" may be fond and foolish in equal measure, but it has a few grace notes to remember, in addition to a fine gallery of images of Eastwood in silhouette, at dusk, against a big sky, alone with his thoughts."
Cry Macho,"The fact is that, as a movie, Cry Macho is slow and sometimes dull."
Cry Macho,"A lyrical, ambling drama that, for all its nerve-racking dangers and sentimental compensations, also looks back at old wounds and confesses that they were heedlessly self-inflicted."
Cry Macho,"If the old man's driving, my advice is to get in and enjoy the ride."
Cry Macho,The simple sincerity about what's worthwhile in life is the movie's reason for being. Nothing more and nothing less.
Cry Macho,A dramatically turgid and thematically thin rumination on [Eastwood's] own iconography in its twilight.
Cry Macho,"Eastwood, showing his 90-plus years but also using them (OK, except for that punch), wears his character like a comfortable shirt."
Cry Macho,"Eastwood's latest Western is a throwback, and not in a good way."
Cry Macho,"In a career filled with them, the solid ""Cry Macho"" might be Clint Eastwood's most straightforward movie yet."
Cry Macho,"Yet another unpretentious, melancholy farewell from a director and actor who has been supposedly retiring from the screen for the past 30 years."
Cry Macho,"Now, approaching twilight, Eastwood has stripped everything down to its essentials. The picture doesn't always work, but it works when it has to."
Cry Macho,"This is a story so crusty and antiquated in its conveniently resolved conflicts, contrivances and drippy sentimentality that it should have been left on the shelf."
Cry Macho,Perhaps Eastwood should have kept his hand on the reins of this pet project while letting someone else sit in the saddle.
Cry Macho,"Cry Macho is dogged by a slack pace and an inertness that overwhelms, scene after scene of nothing, not a funny line or a moving moment or an unresolved conflict, just nothing."
Cry Macho,"If ""Cry Macho"" seems too slight to bear the weight of all this thematic baggage, it nonetheless feels like a picture Eastwood had to make..."
Cry Macho,"This dusty little fable tells a story that mines a gentle power from its self-evident weakness, and it only works as well as it does because it makes you worry if Eastwood may have waited too long to tell it."
Cry Macho,One of the low points of an otherwise illustrious career.
Cry Macho,"It's friendly and diverting and formulaic, in an inoffensive and good-natured way, and it's a totally minor affair."
The Last Duel,"A layered, if uneasy watch."
The Last Duel,"It's a strange, long horror comedy about how women in the 14th century were at the mercy of dudes who were vain, petty, and cruel, only concerned with their own status even when someone's life is at stake."
The Last Duel,"It's Comer who saves it from being a cold, intellectual exercise in storytelling. The subtle modulations in her performance within each segment is more effective than the film's violent ending."
The Last Duel,"It's tempting to think ""The Last Duel"" should have just been Marguerite's account, but so much of the film's pleasure is seeing Damon, Affleck and Driver gradually dismantle and even lampoon their own charms."
The Last Duel,"The Last Duel is a big screen experience if ever there was one and, for the most part, a pretty impressive one."
The Last Duel,"The Ridley Scott-directed, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck-cowritten film is a fascinating text full of spectacle and ideas worth chewing on."
The Last Duel,"Scott has never shied away from the more gruesome aspects of whatever story he happens to be telling and this time the savagery is extreme, clanking armour and all."
The Last Duel,"""The Last Duel"" might work better as a silent film."
The Last Duel,"Clearly, the filmmakers intend for viewers to learn something by watching Marguerite's tale. But what's the point of telling it in this manner? And does it tie up the tale in a too-neat bow?"
The Last Duel,"It's not the most visually explosive film that Ridley Scott has ever made, given the fact that he is such a visual stylist, but it does have a certain thudding power to it that accumulates over time."
The Last Duel,"Not only does it have something to say about the sexism of that era, it has a lot to say about the misogyny of today."
The Last Duel,"What we're left with is a handsome, well-researched drama that's by turns earnest, amusing and unintentionally funny."
The Last Duel,[Its] themes coupled with the atypical manner in which they are presented give The Last Duel more substance than one might expect from a medieval melodrama.
The Last Duel,The Last Duel has a tendency to mirror its central battle's attempts to address complex issues with the blunt tool of rabble-rousing spectacle.
The Last Duel,"There's no way you could predict how joltingly funny and unnervingly entertaining Scott and his incredible team have managed to make something so regal, so grisly, and so bleak."
The Last Duel,"""The Last Duel"" works as both an entertainment - a bottle-blond Affleck roisters happily and hammily along the edges as le Gris' noble sponsor -- and a cautionary tale of how far we've come and how far we haven't."
The Last Duel,"""The Last Duel"" is a wannabe #MeToo movie, the cavalier abuse of experience at six centuries' remove."
The Last Duel,"This is bleak, brutal and bloody with little respite -- aside from Affleck's Count Pierre, who is nicely bitchy. But Marguerite's story? Worth watching solely for that."
The Last Duel,"The Last Duel is perfectly engrossing as a slice of historical intrigue, a clash of iron wills and iron swords, all muddied on the battlefields of medieval France."
The Last Duel,Is Matt Damon the hero or the oaf? It depends on who you ask in the bloody fantastic drama co-starring Jodie Comer and Adam Driver.
The Last Duel,"Perhaps the most impressive performance of all though, is that of director Ridley Scott, still helming multiple major features at the age of 83 in the middle of the global pandemic..."
The Last Duel,"Even as it pretends to add complexity and context, it simplifies and focuses. It's not so much a history lesson as it is a savage, beautiful catharsis - a bonfire of the bros."
The Last Duel,A compelling medieval cautionary tale and a true return to form for Scott
The Last Duel,"The Last Duel is a thematic gold mine, one that sits nicely alongside some of Scott's best work to date."
The Last Duel,"As a portrayal of preening male vanity and misogynistic hypocrisy that exists to this day, ""The Last Duel"" reaches at relevancy with admirable ambition."
The Last Duel,It's been 24 years since Matt Damon and Ben Affleck last collaborated on a movie script. Let's make it 100 next time!
The Last Duel,"""The Last Duel"" is well-intentioned but ponderous and pretentious."
The Last Duel,"The showdownat the film's center was indeed thelast legally sanctioned duel in France's history. But ""The Last Duel"" is just as fixed on the fight that continues today."
The Last Duel,"The production has a lot going for it... But the narrative is cluttered with court intrigue against a background of repetitive battles, and the storytelling structure is exhausting."
The Last Duel,"A Rashomon-like tale that tells its story from different perspectives, this fact-based adaptation of Eric Jager's book is muddy, bloody and grim but too drawn out in filtering 14th-century feudal norms through a modern prism."
The Last Duel,"Its goal is nothing less than being the A-list medieval #MeToo-drama du jour. Unfortunately, it ends up perching so close to parody at times that you'd swear the full title was Monty Python's The Last Duel."
The Last Duel,"Perhaps the first big budget prestige period piece to take its broad sword to rape culture from a female perspective, and it's a startlingly sharp assessment."
The Last Duel,"What's most surprising about The Last Duel is its tonal audacity-an anachronistic bawdiness that would seem to undercut the seriousness of its themes, but instead gives the film a great sense of irony and satirical bite."
The Last Duel,"Although ""Last Duel"" could have dropped at least 10 minutes from its 2 1/2 hour running time, the outstanding ensemble cast anchored by Jodie Comer keeps us engaged."
The Last Duel,"Its old-fashioned movie-making energy commands attention as well as its ingenious, if overextended three-act Rashomon structure..."
The Last Duel,"If ""The Last Duel"" hits some familiar notes, it hits them, more often than not, with both unfeigned anger and an invigoratingly dark sense of humor."
The Last Duel,The story's action is visceral and relentless; the atmosphere gray and thick with intrigue.
The Last Duel,Affleck and Damon have not collaborated as screenwriters since Good Will Hunting -- another movie that mixed goofy ball-busting with darker emotional reckoning -- and their creative partnership yields a similarly invigorating mix of tones here.
The Last Duel,A gripping true story that draws unsettling parallels between past and present.
The Last Duel,"There is something very odd about the match of form and content, a wildly florid movie that bills itself as a scalding indictment of violence against women."
The Last Duel,"Who else but Scott has the required vision and nerve, never mind the resources, to keep making films like this these days?"
The Last Duel,"Indefensibly silly, and also kind of fun."
The Last Duel,"The Last Duel is a surprising jumble, a motley assemblage of tones that often work in perverse harmony."
The Last Duel,There's a power to this film's blunt era-crossing outrage.
The Last Duel,There are a few awkward compromises.But this is the most satisfying film the prolific director has given us in a decade and a half.
The Last Duel,"When The Last Duel campily critiques the preening vanity of men, it soars. When it tries to dig into the daily horrors of life for medieval women, however, it falls into frustrating didacticism."
The Last Duel,It is as ambitious and memorable and impressively messy a storytelling experiment as major-studio films come these days.
The Last Duel,"It all leads up to the title duel which, even by the high standards set by Scott's Gladiator, is what you'd call a humdinger."
The Last Duel,"""The Last Duel"" has mixed results as a socially conscious drama, but as a hardcore period action film, it's brutally effective on the level of Scott's ""Gladiator."""
The Last Duel,"The movie adheres fairly closely to the history, and where the history is incomplete, it fills in the rest with smart choices that both emphasize the drama and make psychological sense."
The Last Duel,"It's not the kind of historical drama you might expect from Ridley Scott, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. And if its threefold perspective tests the patience, it at least gives the right character the final word."
The Last Duel,"When Ridley Scott goes big, he goes huge."
The Last Duel,"Scott, who knows a thing or two about how to mount sweeping historical epics, is in his element here."
The Last Duel,Ridley Scott's medieval saga insightfully revels in the complexities of its competing storylines.
The Last Duel,"Scott manages to fill in the finer brushstrokes of all those characters and still fit the kind of bravura action set pieces he's known for; the fight scenes are breathlessly, bone-crunchingly brutal."
The Last Duel,The big challenge for The Last Duel is to depict a world in which women are marginalised and disempowered without doing the same thing to its female characters. Maybe it should have ceded more of its cold stone floor to Marguerite.
The Last Duel,"In short, come for Scott's direction, but stay for Comer's turn."
The Last Duel,Exists primarily as an excuse for a bunch of charismatic stars to ride horses and snarl at each other by candlelight en route to a genuinely exciting dueling-douchebag climax
The Last Duel,"The film feeds into the very power structure it sets out to debunk, a frustrating miss that threatens to cloud Comer's poignant performance."
The Last Duel,"""The Last Duel"" reveals itself as something all too rare on the current Hollywood field of battle: an intelligent and genuinely daring big budget melee that is - above all else - the product of recognizable artistic collaboration."
The Last Duel,"Despite a brief action interlude here or there, ""The Last Duel"" turns out to be a lavishly convoluted and, at times, rather interesting medieval soap opera."
The Last Duel,The Last Duel is crushed by the weight of its own armour.
The Last Duel,"By the time the film gets round to showing its hand as an episode of Medieval #MeToo, it has numbed us with so much flash and fustian that the heart of the story has almost been drowned."
The Last Duel,A historical epic that even those usually wary of the genre should enjoy.
The Last Duel,"A lengthy, two-and-a-half-hour film that feels lopsided and unwieldy."
The Last Duel,"A medieval yarn that is by turns gruesome, grotesque, gorgeous, and inconsistent."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,American Underdog doesn't ever really connect the modest virtuousness of Kurt and Brenda to Kurt's ascension as a quarterback.
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"""American Underdog"" is a thoroughly predictable yet hugely entertaining sports biopic that is bound to please almost anyone who's not a sourball cynic or a snarky critic."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,The film is sanitized to the point of sterility.
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"Warner's story is inspirational but intricate, and this wan film struggles to balance simple storytelling with the complexities of the sport."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,Each scene has its obvious purpose; you can almost see the scaffolding of the script behind the words. And yet.
American Underdog: The Kurt…,The just-good-enough tale of a nice guy who worked hard and believed in himself and eventually got his chance to shine.
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"As the QB and his tenacious wife, Zachary Levi and Anna Paquin do a fine job of selling the sometimes hokey material."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"American Underdog becomes scarily ecstatic, religious in its fervor for the manufactured thrills of a professional sport many believe has lost sight of its original core values."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"In this well-made crowd-pleaser of a biopic, the story of former Los Angeles Rams quarterback Kurt Warner is told with all the emotion and the abiding respect for the power of faith that it deserves."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"This down-the-middle crowd pleaser ultimately makes for a rousing enough portrayal of against-the-odds fortitude, pad-crunching gridiron action and good old-fashioned Midwestern decency."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"The Erwins sometimes rely too much on tight close-ups of their actors' faces, but they otherwise succeed where so many other feel-good hagiographers have failed simply by giving Levi and his co-stars room enough to sell their corny sports drama."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"The talents in front of the camera are MVPs -- ""Shazam's"" Zachary Levi and Oscar-winner Anna Paquin, with a fourth quarter appearance by Dennis Quaid as Dick Vermeil."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,"If you can swallow your cynicism long enough to watch any number of kids' movies with a ""believe in yourself and you can do anything"" theme, you can probably tolerate American Underdog as well."
American Underdog: The Kurt…,Traditional metrics of quality hardly seem relevant when it comes to a biopic that's less interested in satisfying any narrative conflict than it is in paying off its protagonist's spiritual investment.
Stillwater,"This is a thoughtful, knotty character study, albeit one nestled inside a polished, and less interesting, action thriller."
Stillwater,"It seems Marseilles's immigrant population, as with Knox herself, are treated as mere casualties in Stillwater's grand vision. If only that vision had some substance to it."
Stillwater,"The quality of the acting makes it easy to overlook how increasingly leaden ""Stillwater"" becomes - but not easy enough."
Stillwater,This is a man who has lost step with his times... but there is something touching about his earnest politeness and also something novel: when was the last time you saw a conservative blue-collar dad in a leading role?
Stillwater,"It'd be more openly ridiculous, feel far more manipulative, if not for Damon's performance... [His] magic is in making a certain plainness, a near-anonymity, defiantly charismatic."
Stillwater,"McCarthy's excellent, if sprawling, script is more interested in the humans behind the headlines and the messy ways people try to reconcile their grief and guilt after indescribable trauma."
Stillwater,"Admirable for its convictions, restraint and complicated insights."
Stillwater,"Though the intrinsic likability that makes [Damon] a movie star may be doing half the heavy lifting, you want to invest in this blunt, difficult man."
Stillwater,"This is a movie where I couldn't find my footing for a long time, but I found myself thinking about it a lot."
Stillwater,"Damon is quite good, withholding a lot of histrionics. I don't want to be self-contradictory, but it's a passively expressive performance."
Stillwater,"The one constant is Damon, who's turning out to be one of those great, casual American actors we didn't know we had anymore..."
Stillwater,Damon's versatile acting power onscreen overcomes the flaws of this provocative and stirring drama.
Stillwater,"""Stillwater"" should be a deep investigation into a moral quandary, but it just ends up being shallow and irresponsible."
Stillwater,"McCarthy's film, cowritten with two French screenwriters, seems to want to comprehend and empathize with this flawed hero, but the last word appears to go with the French, who think Americans are stupid -- but good with their hands."
Stillwater,"Stillwater runs long but doesn't run particularly deep -- or at least, not quite deep enough."
Stillwater,"An enthralling, exasperating, and, above all else, ambitious affair that doesn't soften or demand sympathy for its difficult main character but does insist on according him his full humanity."
Stillwater,"Deftly explores... the cultural barriers that prevent us from achieving basic goals, such as solving a murder, and connecting with people unlike ourselves."
Stillwater,"To be fair, it has moments of keenly observed honesty, and the actors are fully believable. But its attempts to engage the viewer's emotions are forced and ineffectual."
Stillwater,"Ultimately, the cacophony of all these plot lines converging and the weight of the messaging being conveyed is almost too much to bear."
Stillwater,"Structurally and tonally, the third act is a challenge. But the longer I linger on it, the more I admire the risk taken by McCarthy."
Stillwater,"As a blunt-force Oklahoma oil rigger trying to save his daughter jailed in France for murder, Matt Damon gives an indelible, implosive performance in a deeply personal human drama disguised as a crime thriller."
Stillwater,Can he change? Can he find grace? Those are the questions that constantly pop up in this overly long but thoughtful work.
Stillwater,"Though scattered individual scenes are compelling, as a whole it feels too torn between what it's ostensibly about and what it actually ends up focusing on."
Stillwater,"What's persuasive, beguiling and not at all formulaic is how the roughneck flourishes and changes under the influence of a good woman who has foibles of her own, and a smart, funny kid."
Stillwater,"""Stillwater"" is a good example of a bad movie despite its sincerity and the powerful gifts of the people behind it."
Stillwater,"The path to getting there isn't always a smooth one, but ""Stillwater"" manages to run deep."
Stillwater,"Most of the time, it's thoughtful and credible in the way it gives its characters second chances, then watches to see if they have the courage to take them."
Stillwater,[An] overstuffed but often thought-provoking movie...
Stillwater,"Ostensibly political stories rarely take partisan stands, and movies like the ponderously earnest ""Stillwater"" sink under the weight of their good intentions."
Stillwater,"Damon's chemistry with both Cottin and Siauvaud is charming to watch while his 'stoical, simple man seeking atonement' storyline is rather moving. You can't help but root for the philistine."
Stillwater,"If we're to empathize with Bill and Allison's plight, it's even more challenging if we question the filmmakers' empathy for these characters, and begs the question of why we're experiencing this story of a young woman's murder through Bill's perspective"
Stillwater,"""Stillwater"" feels like a movie filmed in a slightly blurry state of mind, then reshaped in the editing stage into a whole new blur."
Stillwater,"Mostly the film is guilty of stinting on action and suspense, which makes ""Stillwater"" a little too aptly titled."
Stillwater,"A nervy mixture of character study, romantic drama and thriller, ""Stillwater"" ends up a little out of its depth."
Stillwater,"For most of its length, ""Stillwater"" goes along as a meticulous examination of its central characters. And then suddenly near the end it jumps the tracks."
Stillwater,"Tom McCarthy has a hard time making the unconvincing thriller and procedural elements his own. They intrude on the tender and warm human drama, which is where the director behind The Station Agent and The Visitor excels."
Stillwater,"Whatever McCarthy and his three co-writers are trying to say is drowned out by the clanging ungainliness of their script. I have never wanted a film to end so quickly, and so differently."
Stillwater,Stillwater gives itself over to drastic plot twists that derail what was already a film over-stuffed with narrative incident and ideas.
Stillwater,"Audiences will come away feeling like they've really been somewhere, that they were moved by the people they met and expanded by the experience. You can't ask more from a movie."
Stillwater,"It's possible to be genuinely moved by that reckoning - and to admire the obvious intelligence and care that have been brought to bear on ""Stillwater"" - without fully buying the trail of contrivances and compromises it leaves in its wake."
Stillwater,"Unfortunately, the A plot keeps dragging the movie down"
Stillwater,"As for the ending, put it this way: when you ask an audience to sit for two hours and 20 minutes, it's only polite to give them something for their trouble."
Stillwater,"It doesn't coalesce completely, but Damon and Cottin keep it engaging."
Stillwater,"From one vantage point, Stillwater may just be a sentimental and lurid riff on the infamous Amanda Knox case. But I think McCarthy has something bigger in mind, which he pokes at intriguingly throughout his movie's considerable sprawl."
Stillwater,This is no swooning epic but it does hit some stirring emotional notes.
Stillwater,"As with that Audiard output, ""Stillwater"" takes a thriller form and roots it with a deep sense of context and place."
Stillwater,"Stillwater gestures towards prescient issues and questions that we rarely see white filmmakers grapple with, but overall the film feels unfocused and fails to pack a real punch."
Stillwater,"On the surface, that may not satisfy everyone, but then, to coin a phrase, ""Stillwater"" runs deep."
Stillwater,"Of course, no matter how beguilingly entertaining it is to watch ""Stillwater"" drift away from the movie you thought it would be, you know that it's only a matter of time before the devil gets his due."
The Runner,"Rooted thoroughly in its protagonist’s introspection, The Runner makes up for what it lacks in thriller pacing with an ambitious depth of fraughtness."
Loren and Rose,"Beautifully acted, intelligently scripted and sensitively directed, Loren & Rose showcases the undervalued, not always properly showcased talents of Jacqueline Bisset."
King Richard,"Brandi is a more interesting character, thanks to a superb performance from Ellis, and their scenes together are the best in the movie, although the tennis sequences are very well shot and edited."
King Richard,Smith is entertaining. His single-mindedness should make him a bore but he somehow retains his talent to amuse whatever else is on his mind.
King Richard,"Featuring a towering performance from Will Smith in the title role, proving that a hero is not necessarily easy to root for."
King Richard,"This is a dream role for Will Smith and he attacks it with gusto. Williams is a larger-than-life character who just happens to be real, and Smith embodies his underdog, combative, indefatigable spirit to perfection."
King Richard,"King Richard has a Will Smith problem. It is obviously meant to be award catnip for Smith and a cinematic crowning for Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena. And yet Smith's starring role may be the weakest part of the film."
King Richard,"In this compelling, well-acted but conventionally told biopic about the unconventional dad of tennis icons Serena and Venus Williams, actor Will Smith makes another convincing bid to collect some acting trophies."
King Richard,Smith's work here is quite effective; he expresses Williams' temerity with an easygoing slyness that is seductive enough to (briefly) look past problematic questions of exploitation.
King Richard,"It's a welcome addition to the biopic genre, buoyed by a career-defining performance from Will Smith."
King Richard,"King Richard spotlights the work to make a dream come true...and yes, I've seen it twice..."
King Richard,The conventions of the inspirational sports drama are too formidable an opponent to defeat.
King Richard,"Smith is excellent, fully inhabiting the character in one of the only roles to date that has required him to fully shed his habitual gloss of Will Smith charm."
King Richard,"Regardless of how much is true, how much has been softened and reshaped to suit the movie's perspective, and how much is fabricated, the end result is compelling drama with top-notch performances and a feel-good denouement."
King Richard,"Venus and Serena Williams are the names we rightly remember, but King Richard remains fixated on the male bravado that pushed for them to get their names out there in the first place."
King Richard,"Funny and inspirational, he disappears into the role of the man obsessed with bringing his daughters to the top of their game."
King Richard,King Richard is driving hard to be a feel-good movie that celebrates a Black father who overcame the odds to lift his family out of poverty and guided his daughters' to their full potential.
King Richard,"It's one of those impressive fusions between actor and character, which all comes across so effortlessly onscreen, but gives King Richard the lifeblood it needs to triumph as a film."
King Richard,"The Williams sisters' saga is so improbably inspirational that watching their ascent, coupled with Smith's crackerjack performance, had me grinning the entire time. It's the most sheerly pleasurable movie I've seen so far this year."
King Richard,"Whatever rough edges have been sanded off the real Richard Williams in this telling, it's still a hell of a story."
King Richard,"[Smith's] performance here is not a full-on impersonation, as far as I can tell. Instead, he seems to have brought his own poetic physicality to the part."
King Richard,"The movie's brightest-burning idea, and it is sincerely moving, is that Richard, for his flaws, does what he does on behalf of the young Black women he's raising. This rings true in real life and in fiction."
King Richard,"Though [Will Smith]'s putting the full weight of his significant charm behind the characterization, it's not quite enough to illuminate a puzzling figure."
King Richard,"Green's King Richard isn't a great movie, but it doesn't need to be when the characters are this warm, and its message is so earnest."
King Richard,It's one of those crowd-pleasing movies that doesn't make you feel embarrassed to be part of the crowd-you feel buoyed rather than talked down to.
King Richard,"""King Richard"" is inspiring and involving, based on truth, but it's not a conventional sports biopic by any measure."
King Richard,"If you are going to make a sports family portrait, this is probably the one to go for."
King Richard,"A straight-edge, inspirational sporting film of the old school - closer to Rocky than Hoop Dreams."
King Richard,"As the hard-driving daddy of Venus and Serena Williams, Will Smith gives the performance of his life in an unapologetic crowd-pleaser. You just may want to stand up and cheer."
King Richard,"King Richard is a spellbinding biopic of a complicated man and his two incredible daughters, all working together to do what was previously considered impossible."
King Richard,"a big, traditional crowd pleaser. It doesn't innovate the sports movie formula, but it works because star Will Smith is right in the pocket as Richard Williams."
King Richard,"Williams did something even more important and even more difficult than raising ""two Mozarts"" - he raised daughters who want the world to love him the way they do."
King Richard,"An engrossing family drama that doubles as a sharp rethink of how a family operates within the overlapping, often overbearing spheres of race, class, sports and celebrity."
King Richard,"The ""Fresh Prince"" is dead! Long live the ""King!"""
King Richard,"Smith aces the performance, which is the main attribute in elevating the story above the standard sports-movie conventions."
King Richard,Smith aces his performance as a homegrown tennis guru in this solid and satisfying biopic.
King Richard,"Mostly, it's a story about being a parent, about having faith in one's children and about being absolutely right."
King Richard,"It's a showy part, and Smith gives it all he's got, which is a lot."
King Richard,Smith elevates a standard-issue sports-drama into the stratosphere of sky-high entertainment.
King Richard,"In the best Hollywood tradition, ""King Richard"" stirs up a lot of emotion while remaining buoyant and engaging."
King Richard,"A grown-up crowd-pleaser, built on an old-school grandstand star turn."
King Richard,"It makes for a powerful journey, a thrilling success story and a stirring tribute to the strength of family. ""Richard"" is king."
King Richard,What we have here is moderately good sports biopic with a very fine performance at center court.
King Richard,"Will Smith delivers a ferocious, all-consuming performance in ""King Richard,"" a thoroughly entertaining portrait of Richard Williams - better known as Venus and Serena's father."
King Richard,"The difference between this and your run-of-the-mill ""bait,"" which is too cynical a term to glom onto something that's so sincere, is that King Richard is good. It's moving and inspiring, even if it's not exactly inspired."
King Richard,"That's what makes King Richard an unexpectedly compelling sports film: its focus on the subtle chaos bubbling just outside of the game, personified by one complicated, impassioned figure."
King Richard,"When I saw the film, with a big crowd, you could sense people leaning into the story and feeding off its verve."
King Richard,"A rousing if familiar sports drama that takes care of the surface-level narrative but doesn't delve deeply enough into the meatier stuff, at times seeming to have the wrong focal point."
King Richard,"the movie keeps enough of Richard's messy past off screen to feel like a hagiography with a few concessions, rather than a true warts-and-all portrait."
King Richard,"It's not really a film about tennis at all so much as yet another rehearsal of the American dream: the achievement of the apparently impossible by the individual, whatever the adverse circumstances."
King Richard,"King Richard is half sports movie, half biopic. As such, it hits the sweet spots and sour notes of both genres."
King Richard,"""King Richard,"" though perhaps a tad overlong, is as irresistible as the young legends at its center; you watch with pleasure, thinking of the many future champions it might inspire."
King Richard,"It's easy to enjoy this classic, disarming American saga. Easier to watch the father, mother and daughters shake up the stodgy world of tennis. Expect audiences -- in theaters or their living rooms -- to applaud everyone's efforts."
King Richard,It's to the credit of director Reinaldo Marcus Green and star Will Smith that this film makes the case for its counter-intuitive focal point.
King Richard,Rarely has a film used its foreknowledge of a happy ending as a reason to remain so uncritical and incurious of its central subject.
King Richard,"While King Richard expects you to play along with its fudges and elisions, its story still feels as momentous as the Williams sisters' own achievements - which, in a genre that naturally tacks towards cliché, is no mean feat."
King Richard,"A strong, confident picture with winning performances from Sidney and Singleton."
King Richard,"As stirring and heart-warming as you'd like, this is a hugely touching family opus. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's straight from the heart and gets you in the gut."
King Richard,"A towering turn from Will Smith, his best since Ali and one of the year's great screen performances, defines nearly every frame of this film."
King Richard,"The film is probably too long at 138 minutes, yet its dramatic and visual energy seldom flags. King Richard is a sports movie that transcends itself without losing track of itself."
King Richard,Manages to be both a surprisingly nuanced portrait of a flawed and deeply complicated man and the kind of classic-uplift sports movie that used to fill multiplexes once upon a time.
King Richard,"Green orchestrates these various elements into a symphony that's a tribute to hard-working parents, however difficult they may be, and to showing the origin story that begins a generation before our heroes became famous."
King Richard,"King Richard is perfectly timed; his performance is a sterling reminder of Smith's singular charge, seizing upon a mighty challenge with thrilling recommitment."
King Richard,"It is far from a perfect film, but it tantalizes, thanks to the strong subject matter and the sharp characterizations and performances."
King Richard,Will Smith hits a winner with King Richard.
King Richard,The film embodies its namesake's oft-repeated - if increasingly suspect - ethos of making sure that fun comes first.
King Richard,Indie director Reinaldo Marcus Green steps up his game big time in this engaging true-life drama about how Richard Williams steered his daughters to dominate the sport of tennis.
Rare Objects,It's a deeply moving film I liked a lot.
Rare Objects,"Unfortunately, none of the movie’s good intentions ever pan out."
Rare Objects,"As appealing a setting as this is for a movie, I couldn’t help but feel that the premise doesn’t quite parse."
Rare Objects,"For long stretches of its two-hour running time, “Rare Objects,” a story of recovery and addition based on Kathleen Tessaro’s novel of the same name, is a heavy, somewhat slow-moving drama that seems perhaps better suited to the stage."
Rare Objects,"Admirable premise, shaky execution."
Respect,ERROR
House of Gucci,"A very fine cast of American actors speaking with Italian accents ensures that, despite its length, there's always something interesting happening on screen."
House of Gucci,"Isn't that all we really want from the movies? Brain soft, Gucci soothing, and that's all she wrote."
House of Gucci,"Lady Gaga makes an immediate and indelible impression as Patrizia Reggiani, the future Signora Gucci, in Ridley Scott's film about the Guccis' fractured history."
House of Gucci,"It's long and poorly paced and plays too loose with the facts. Oh, well! The bonkers true story that chronicles the unraveling of the Italian fashion empire is also first-class frothy and fun entertainment."
House of Gucci,"This glorious melodrama is an instant cult classic, a joy to behold, a meme-factory in the making..."
House of Gucci,"It gave me everything I needed -- and then some. I wanted the film to be over-the-top, messy, silly, involving, gorgeous, stylish -- and it's all those things."
House of Gucci,Unambitious and underwhelming.
House of Gucci,"The rest, however, is left struggling to find its footing as it oscillates between soap opera and prestige drama."
House of Gucci,There are bad aspects of it that only make it more enjoyable.
House of Gucci,I think it's fun. I think it's extremely silly. I think it's tonally all over the place. I think it's defiantly worth watching.
House of Gucci,"The production is proficient and shameless, cut to operatic arias and bouncy Italian pop, edited mercilessly for effect."
House of Gucci,"Uneven, overlong and completely over the top, and has characters and plot turns that Marvel and Pixar would reject as 'a bit much'. The good news is that it is undeniably a proper drama and, for the most part, wildly entertaining."
House of Gucci,"A luxe, rather ridiculous look at the uber-rich."
House of Gucci,"A loud, enjoyably pointless opera buffa that fictionalizes the financial and criminal shenanigans of the famous Italian design family."
House of Gucci,Caught between the lure of campy excess and the seeming desire to tell a more somber tale of dynastic struggle.
House of Gucci,"When Lady Gaga is on screen, this movie is very watchable and compelling. When she is gone, it is about a bunch of guys sitting around conference tables in expensive suits talking about documents."
House of Gucci,"It's mostly that big fight over that fortune, about how absolute power corrupts absolutely."
House of Gucci,"If the film is remembered for anything, it's for being Exhibit A as what a great actor [Lady Gaga] is. Forget Gucci. Long live the house that Gaga built."
House of Gucci,"House of Gucci does a solid job of evoking its recent-history milieu, boasting a beige and brown palette that reeks of nicotine and caffeine, with occasional bursts of reportage-style monochrome."
House of Gucci,"House of Gucci is a titillating, ridiculous and utterly engrossing soap opera."
House of Gucci,"In short, this isn't a bad film, and it's probably worth seeing for Lady Gaga alone, but also it's not a great one."
House of Gucci,"This long, bouncy tale of the Italian luxury designers' fall never met a fast car it didn't slow down to capture. And it loves actors!"
House of Gucci,"Scott goes for broke, hitting the mark more often than he misses, but when those shots go wide, they do so by a country mile."
House of Gucci,"Scott is by no-means a ""can't miss"" filmmaker. Although this is far from the worst films he has made, House of Gucci is among his most disappointing."
House of Gucci,"What of great acting that looks and feels like acting, that draws on the performer's own outsize persona, that lands on the screen larger, lusher and more lavish than life? That's gone slightly out of fashion, and is all the more delicious for its rarity."
House of Gucci,There's a joyful campiness to House of Gucci that is firmly established by the pop star turned movie star's performance.
House of Gucci,"Smart, funny and camp, it's not interested in keeping a straight face, strutting its way to glory. This is all fizz and no faff."
House of Gucci,"Lady Gaga is never less than fascinating to watch and Driver, always impressive, gives one of his best performances in this bananas story of glamor, ambition, and betrayal."
House of Gucci,"The film is a tragi-comic triumph of operatic proportions. Thanks in no small part to stand-out star Lady Gaga, House of Gucci has made melodrama fashionable again."
House of Gucci,I found the film so insistently campy yet painfully mirthless-its style lies somewhere between opera buffa and telenovela-that my mental state of acute anguish may have skewed my perceptions of whatever the story has to offer.
House of Gucci,"You reach the end of the movie, sometimes having been entertained and more often irritated, and wonder, ""What were they trying to do here?"""
House of Gucci,"Say this for ""House of Gucci,"" it announces its basic silliness right off the bat."
House of Gucci,"It's a movie blueprinted to be a hit, and if it succeeds-whether with boomers, millennials, Gaga's Little Monsters, or some sort of broad coalition-it'll sadly prove its own point about the inherent, illicit, and insubstantial allure of wretched excess."
House of Gucci,"Like it or not, see this lavish soap opera and you'll know you've been to the movies."
House of Gucci,"This would have made such a better streaming series. As is, it's an overstuffed turkey."
House of Gucci,"It is, at times, nakedly and bewilderingly bad - but you have to admire Scott's energy."
House of Gucci,"House of Gucci is not only a bad film, but a bad advert for cinema."
House of Gucci,"...This melodrama à la mode is 150 minutes of goofy fun, filled with wild performances, killer costumes, and Salma Hayek playing a ... witch."
House of Gucci,"House of Gucci isn't aggressively bad, but it is undeniably tedious, threadbare, and unengaging."
House of Gucci,"There is indeed lots to be found in House of Gucci once you let go of your expectations of, say, learning anything about the Gucci company or understanding the characters' motivations."
House of Gucci,"Regrets, we have more than a few regarding ""House of Gucci,"" beginning with the underachieving A-list cast."
House of Gucci,A grisly carnival of poorly executed and just bad ideas. It's difficult to count the ways in which House of Gucci is undeserving of your time.
House of Gucci,"Amid the jumble of fake Italian accents and overall too-muchness, an Oscar-ready Lady Gaga is flat-out fabulous. Is this ravishing soap opera of high fashion and higher crimes outrageous camp or ""The Godfather"" in designer duds? I'm calling a tossup."
House of Gucci,"It opts for fun over quality, but there's no reason it couldn't have had both."
House of Gucci,"This old ""House"" can be enjoyed for the toothiness of its performances and the soapy situations without feeling like the attraction this mix of marquee names in front of and behind the camera was intended to yield."
House of Gucci,"House of Gucci is Ridley Scott's angry version of a fairy tale, in which glory walks hand in hand with treachery."
House of Gucci,"Something is missing. A lot of things, really, but mostly a strong idea and a credible reason for existing."
House of Gucci,"Gaga delivers a bravura performance as Patrizia, an alchemical blend of sheer charisma, power of personality, undeniable magnetism, and most importantly, commitment to the bit."
House of Gucci,"Director Ridley Scott seems firmly in American Gangster mode here, a by-the-numbers biographical approach that fits the film like one of Leto's pastel suits."
House of Gucci,A film that would have benefited from a coherent silhouette and a little hemming of its tiresome runtime.
House of Gucci,"""House of Gucci"" is no masterpiece, but it's often crazy good fun."
House of Gucci,"With a cast often unafraid to push the limits of camp, Ridley Scott's ""House of Gucci"" often works enough to be enjoyable."
House of Gucci,Gaga's performance is wonderful because she's alive to every moment.
House of Gucci,"""House of Gucci,"" in its briskly efficient professionalism, is the very exemplar of one-size-fits-all dramaturgy, of off-the-rack cinematic style, of directorial hack work."
House of Gucci,"Scott is not just at the height of his powers, he's breaking new ground."
House of Gucci,"It's hard to take House Of Gucci seriously, because it never seems to take itself seriously. Yet with such glee being had by those involved, it's an infectious, bizarro bit of fun."
House of Gucci,The fact that the major cast members can't seem to agree on what kind of film they're actually making is one of its most glaring hitches - and also one of its ripest pleasures.
House of Gucci,"The evolution of the Patrizia/Maurizio relationship is riveting and the highlight of House of Gucci. It's loaded with extreme ups and downs, but has just enough nuance to keep it human."
House of Gucci,"For those willing to take the uneven ride, ""The Godfather"" meets ""Hustlers"" meets ""The Devil Wears Prada"" turns out to be a pretty fun pitch for an awards-season contender."
House of Gucci,This true-crime saga of the Gucci family losing control of their own fashion empire could have been a full-blown camp classic were it not so frequently dull and tentative.
House of Gucci,"You'd have to squint pretty hard to see a howling high-camp romp in House Of Gucci. Instead, what we get is a fact-based family melodrama, and a rather meandering one at that."
House of Gucci,"While the rest of the cast are busy chewing the scenery, it is left to Driver to rein in the madness with one of his greatest performances yet."
House of Gucci,"House Of Gucci can switch into camp faster than you can swing a bamboo-handled handbag... But it's also unsettling, entertaining, and really quite unusual: like next year's fashions from a more extreme house, it grows on you."
House of Gucci,"House of Gucci meanders all too frequently, and yet it remains an entertaining ride even when you desperately want it to get back on the track Gaga's work so cleanly lays out."
House of Gucci,"It is stupidly watchable. If you don't know or remember the details of what went down, save the search for after. Just wear your gaudiest designer logo, order a martini at the bar and give in to the easy pleasures of House of Gucci."
House of Gucci,House of Gucci feels coldly calculating when it should have been flush and warm with scandalous sensationalism.
House of Gucci,"For Scott, ""House of Gucci"" is an entertaining if dramatically thin return to the fact-based machinations of the rich, famous and weaselly."
House of Gucci,"Apologies for making any of this sound like ""Gucci"" could be one of those so-bad-it's-good larks. For all its imperfections, the sin this movie is most guilty of is taking itself too seriously."
House of Gucci,"Locked in a heated conversation with its own campiness from the moment it starts, House of Gucci leverages that underlying conflict into an operatic portrait of the tension between wealth and value."
House of Gucci,"House of Gucci is an icepick docudrama that has a great deal of fun with its grand roster of ambitious scoundrels, but it's never less than a straight-faced and nimbly accomplished movie."
House of Gucci,Ridley Scott's film is a trashtacular watch that I wouldn't have missed for the world. But it fails to settle on a consistent tone -- overlong and undisciplined as it careens between high drama and opera buffa.
House of Gucci,"It's certainly no masterpiece, though not for lack of a great performance from Lady Gaga. It's an investment, but watching this cast do these things is worth the price of admission."
House of Gucci,"Every time Gaga comes on screen, you just can't help grinning at her sly elegance, mischief and performance-IQ, channelling Gina Lollobrigida or Claudia Cardinale in their early-50s gamine styles."
House of Gucci,"Even a ""House"" divided is still more fun than it probably should be: a big messy chef's kiss to money and fashion and above all, movie stars -- criming and scheming like they have nothing left to lose, until it's true."
House of Gucci,"It's a fashion show, figuratively and often literally, and its cutthroat dynamics are lightened with heavy dollops of foam and froth."
House of Gucci,"House of Gucci is big and bold, a colorful romp that knows when it comes to fashion, the most important rule is to look good no matter what. Consider that test passed with flying colors."
House of Gucci,"The abysmal ""Gucci"" would get a better grade, perhaps, if it was a term paper titled ""How to Make the Assassination of a Famous Person Boring."""
House of Gucci,Ridley Scott's tale of greed and revenge practically begs for melodramatic excess.
House of Gucci,"Lady Gaga again owns the big screen in the true-life drama House of Gucci, though this time it's not a pop star that's born but instead one of soapy greatness."
House of Gucci,House of Gucci is probably the funniest comedy and dopiest tragedy of the year. Everyone chomps on the scenery.
House of Gucci,"As Paolo Gucci would say, and indeed did wail, mid-way through the movie, ""Why-ah? Why-ah? Why-ah?"""
Found Wandering Lost,ERROR
Framing Agnes,"A fascinating, multidimensional, mosaic-like glimpse at transgender life from the 1950s to today as interpreted by — and through — a group of transmasculine and transfeminine performers and creatives and one uniquely impressive academic."
Framing Agnes,"With only Garfinkel’s archives to go on, Drucker is able to give a sly, necessarily mysterious air to Agnes’s life. And, yes: the format is quite fun to watch, too."
Framing Agnes,Essential viewing.
Framing Agnes,"Joynt’s scope as a researcher is admirably broad, but what his film lacks is a sense of purpose as a work of cinema."
Framing Agnes,"It’s a smart and inventive method of storytelling that nods to the reality that, until very recently, most trans people in pop culture have been relegated to trashy daytime TV, where they’ve tended to be cruelly depicted as aberrations."
Framing Agnes,"[A] richly heady, thoughtful documentary [that] is constantly welcoming us in by reflecting on itself."
Framing Agnes,Framing Agnes is a film of quiet but decisive radicality that builds its own genesis and production into it.
Framing Agnes,"Unfortunately, Framing Agnes gets too wrapped up in the questions surrounding storytelling to do any actual storytelling."
Framing Agnes,"It's a rewarding and informative hybrid film, which takes an academic gender studies foundation as a launchpad to explore the lived experiences of trans people then and now."
Framing Agnes,It's about the truths we share and the truths we will never know.
Framing Agnes,The combination of past and present makes Framing Agnes far richer and more thought-provoking than it would have been had it focused on only one or the other.
The Almond and the Seahorse,"Only when Sarah and Toni meet for the first time, an hour in, does the film allow a genuine conversation — and, gratefully, a moment of recognition."
The Almond and the Seahorse,"Much like the memories of its secondary characters, “The Almond and the Seahorse” is rife with gaps and oddities. This is often in the service of melodrama, which lands with a saccharine thud."
The Almond and the Seahorse,"It’s fertile dramatic ground, though it has been more fruitful in “50 First Dates” and “Memento,” among others. The cast is game. Unfortunately, what should be gut punches feel like glancing blows."
The Almond and the Seahorse,"The story... feels told rather than explored, keeping all the characters at arm’s length for most of the running time."
The Almond and the Seahorse,"This overstuffed narrative never quite finds its footing, wobbling between cutesy comedy and tearful histrionics."
Losing Ground,ERROR
The Modern Way,ERROR
Highway One,"[An] unfunny and laborious piece of work with... muddy lighting, flat sound design and torpid, almost indistinguishable performances."
Going All the Way,Going All the Way is worthy of a visit from those who may need to give it a second chance or those who need to discover a true hidden gem.
Going All the Way,"Pellington deserves praise for going back to the past, making Going All The Way the film it was meant to be. It's a lovely tale of friendship, a warm time capsule showcasing two strong performances that becomes more than just another ""coming home"" story."
Italian Studies,I don't really know what they're aiming for here... There needs to be a point to why we're telling this particular story in this particular way.
Italian Studies,It's only 81 minutes long but feels like an eternity or two.
Italian Studies,"Its idea of time is multidimensional, as is its idea of form."
Italian Studies,"Adam Leon's brief, stylish film never fully unpacks its intriguing premise, but gains feeling and texture from Kirby's performance as a writer in a dissociative fugue."
Italian Studies,"For a long stretch, Italian Studies turns this trip down memory-loss lane into a low-wattage livewire, an unpredictable stroll into the unknown."
Italian Studies,Mildly auspicious if ultimately disappointing.
Italian Studies,""" a unique curio of a film, a free sketch of time and place melting into a singular subjective experience that asks ""does memory matter?"" Perhaps, it does not."""
Italian Studies,"During an amnesiac's atmospheric nighttime ramble through Manhattan, the seeds of a narrative are sewn but never nurtured."
Italian Studies,What's most distinctive about writer/director Adam Leon's spacey NYC drama is its total lack of structure. Jean-Luc Godard fans will be pleased. Others maybe not.
Italian Studies,The looseness that worked so well in Leon's earlier films here just feels slack and empty.
Italian Studies,"The barrier between the real and the fictional encounters is increasingly permeable, as is the line between social norms and unacceptable behaviour, in this freewheeling, spontaneous voyage into the unknown."
Italian Studies,Kirby is so magnetic and half-opened as a woman who's forgotten everything besides her own force of will that no one will ever second-guess why Leon agreed to work with her before he even had an idea of what they would make together.
Gossamer Folds,"...offers hope that even during times and places we think of as stereotypically intolerant, underdogs have always found and helped one another out."
Gossamer Folds,"A tender, honest, and heartwarming tale, 'Gossamer Folds' is an absolute gem of a film."
Gossamer Folds,Much of the appeal of the film is down to Alexandra Grey's nuanced and charismatic performance as Gossamer.
There There,About half the vignettes are keepers...
There There,"There There skews its world ever so slightly, arriving at some nicely off-kilter insights amid its non sequiturs, but for all its neat tricks, function is definitely following form here."
There There,"If the resulting film feels like little more than the cinematic equivalent of a series of B-sides of varying quality strung together, it at least whets the appetite for the next proper cinematic album that Bujalski releases."
There There,"There There doesn't come to life, even as an intellectual or artistic exercise."
There There,"As was once said of Boston weather, if you don’t like what you’re seeing, just wait a minute. But what’s not to like?"
There There,"If the faintly amusing final product is pretty thin gruel when compared to the rest of its filmmaker’s output, the project’s high-concept construction is clever enough to sustain the meandering story it tells."
There There,"A funny and cleverly linked series of dramedic vignettes that doesn’t try to hide the stitchwork imposed by pandemic-period production restrictions. Instead, the film leans into them..."
There There,"The longer “There There” goes, the more it meanders and never into the realm of anything particularly funny or compelling."
There There,"Feels like a retreat to older work [Bujalski]'s thought to have long moved away from, and a somewhat haphazard retreat at that."
There There,A largely unsuccessful experiment about struggling to connect.
Learn to Swim,"Tommy... riffs freely, aping the moody, improvisatory style of classic jazz as he works some rich variations on the all-too-common story of an artist knocked around by a rough romance."
Learn to Swim,"In this feature directing debut, with a screenplay he co-wrote with Marnie Van Dyk, Tommy works well with his ensemble and is clearly intrigued by emotional states. Or at least the idea of them."
Learn to Swim,"Just like a jazz tune, the film establishes an image, elaborates on it and brings it back to a more-or-less satisfying close."

Wildhood,"It’s striking, certainly, but teasingly elusive when it comes to story resolution."
Wildhood,"There is an open-heartedness and gentleness in it, and a sense of style and place that reaches back to Malick and arguably even Mark Twain."
Wildhood,"Enlivened by elegant handheld cinematography and a galvanizing breakout performance from Phillip Lewitski, Wildhood is a beautiful testament to the power of authentic storytelling."
Wildhood,"Hannam’s feature might be conventional in structure, but it’s a lovely film with relatable characters you want to see overcome the roadblocks tossed at them."
Wildhood,"The quiet candor with which Hannam addresses issues of masculinity, and how it intersects with an Indigenous and queer identity, elevates this otherwise conventional story."
Wildhood,"It's immersive, visually stunning, and compelling."
Wildhood,"Rather than a run-of-the-mill coming-of-age road trip, “Wildhood” is a young protagonist’s quest to bring harmony to the intersections of his identity."
Wildhood,"As Wildhood unfolds, it soaks up its initial catalysts of trauma and applies the balm of tenderness, love, compassion, and the bliss of finding exactly what its protagonist was hoping for, if not more."
Wildhood,"The emotions are heavy and the sense of vulnerability unshakable in this open wound of a film about broken lineage, generational trauma and the yearning to find community."
Wildhood,"Wildhood combines the foundation of heartrending coming-of-age narratives with the feel-good elements of road trip flicks to create a delicate, not to mention visually appealing, sophomore film."
Wildhood,Wildhood is a worthy addition to the growing canon of Indigenous film and TV works.
Rite of the Shaman,"Rite Of The Shaman is an engaging, dramatic look at the obstacles life throws our way."
Charlotte,"While the soft pastel backdrops are rather lovely, the film seems cocooned by design in its own prettiness, doing little to illustrate the encroaching darkness."
Charlotte,"Though somewhat flawed and less artistically daring than it could be, Charlotte still makes for an emotional, humane viewing experience."
Charlotte,"Tahir Rana and Éric Warin make provocative storytelling choices, consistently accentuating the political darkness around Salomon with a festering sense of familial unease."
Charlotte,A sobering animated biopic...
Charlotte,An imperfect yet compelling overview of Charlotte’s life.
Charlotte,"This is an absorbingly told story; Knightley’s vocal performance is engaging and Charlotte’s face, in particular, is strongly and expressively drawn."
Charlotte,A tragic reminder that fleeing a nightmare may mean more than just keeping it in your rearview mirror.
Charlotte,"Charlotte is a museum trip of a movie: quiet, quaint and leisurely."
Charlotte,"Isnt afraid to confront the more morally complicated aspects of Salomons biography, although in an apparent attempt to keep the film tasteful, some of the horrors her family endured are kept so tidily off-screen that their impact is a little diminished."
Charlotte,"In the end, “Charlotte” is bereft of the spirit of the artist who made the uncanny “Life? or Theatre?” What an even better tribute the movie would have been had it also taken heated energy from Salomon’s art."
Charlotte,"For the chance to become acquainted with Salomon’s tragic and unique tale, as well as with her enduring output, this well-intended portrait is worth a look."
Charlotte,"This remains a remarkable story, even if told in a less-than-remarkable film."
Charlotte,"Why use animation to tell such a harrowing story? In the hands of directors Eric Warin and Tahir Rana and their creative colleagues, it's the perfect choice."
Charlotte,"For a film which is so consumed by the notion of painting as Charlotte's primary means of expression, the screenplay, by Erik Rutherford and David Bezmozgis is illuminated by some very elegant and articulate dialogue."
Charlotte,"The genius of Charlotte, directed by Eric Warin and Tahir Rana, is to recognize that the best way to tell this story is through animation that can reproduce Salomon's quick expressionistic gouaches as it recounts her life."
The Sound of Violet,"Once I embraced the film’s true intentions, I found The Sound of Violet a bold and engaging film."
The Eternal Daughter,"An extraordinarily moving drama of celebration, regret, creation, loss, and family, this latest feature by writer-director Joanna Hogg grabbed my heart in an icily intimate embrace and then refused to let go."
The Eternal Daughter,Swinton pulls off a rare trick with such conviction that you find yourself forgetting she’s doing it: playing the two leading roles in the film herself.
The Eternal Daughter,Tilda Swinton gives two stunning performances...
The Eternal Daughter,"How can a movie that seemingly does so little amount to so much? It’s because of the story lurking beyond it all -- the psychological battle being waged, so quietly, under the surface of everything."
The Eternal Daughter,"Very slow, very methodical, very moody and you do feel like you're in a ghost story... but it has a sense of dissatisfaction."
The Eternal Daughter,"What separates this film is the delicate handling of what both parents and children want from each other. Setting it as a ghostly, dreamlike story, Hogg is able to reveal truths while also showing the aspirational ideal of such relationships."
The Eternal Daughter,Sneakily and suggestively subverts our expectations of a ghost story… to create this eerie dreamspace within which Julie finds herself.
The Eternal Daughter,"Hogg's latest is either her slyest joke to date, or another swerve in an especially fecund career phase."
The Eternal Daughter,"The Eternal Daughter feels like a first draft, or a sketch to be filled in later ... Hogg's outlines, though, are more interesting than other people's finished products. There's always so much to think about."
The Eternal Daughter,A lovely and haunted dream of a movie...
The Eternal Daughter,Truly haunting.
The Eternal Daughter,"An eerie gothic horror movie that continues the story of The Souvenir films in an oddly abstract, confoundingly meta, and utterly mesmerizing way."
The Eternal Daughter,"“The Eternal Daughter” is haunting, as all the best ghost stories are. The best love stories too."
The Eternal Daughter,"A gentle and mournful spell is cast by Joanna Hogg’s The Eternal Daughter, a ghost story where memory is manifested -- visited, intruded upon and, finally, made to glow."
The Eternal Daughter,It’s moving and poignant and quietly extraordinary should you surrender to its spell.
The Eternal Daughter,"Hogg brings the creeping sense of dread to the film that great horror directors do. It keeps the audience on edge, even in the slowest moments. What’s wrong here? What are we seeing? More importantly, what are we not?"
The Eternal Daughter,"“The Eternal Daughter” is a keenly discerning movie about the relationship of mother and daughter, who are bound together by a fierce love but kept apart by unbridgeable differences of character and of experience."
The Eternal Daughter,Joanna Hogg’s new collaboration with Tilda Swinton is a gothic horror movie of living discomforts.
The Eternal Daughter,"Hogg nods at the ghostly conventions – fog, moon, lurking rooftop statuary – while subtly teasing out the protagonist’s not fully processed personal traumas. A low-key gem featuring one of cinema’s great dogs."
The Eternal Daughter,The Eternal Daughter offers an invitation to contemplation. There's something mesmerizing about watching Swinton expertly lobbing her dialogue back and forth between alter egos.
The Eternal Daughter,"The film is extremely tender in registering the affection between a mother and daughter, and there’s a penultimate shot that just about took my breath away. The movie’s a gift, to Hogg’s own late mother and to us."
The Eternal Daughter,"Like the best of the classic gothic ghost stories, The Eternal Daughter leaves you unsettled and unsure of what really is happening."
The Eternal Daughter,The film is honest and poignant in its kaleidoscopic refractions of the frustration inherent in a process that’s only just beginning.
The Eternal Daughter,"The Eternal Daughter isn’t just a ghost story but a song, sung by a daughter to her mother across a small table at dinner, or across the space that remains when the people we love have left us."
The Eternal Daughter,"The Eternal Daughter is also an ode to mothers and daughters that will leave a few teary messes in the stalls, and it’s beautifully acted by Tilda Swinton in not one, but two roles."
The Eternal Daughter,"A striking phantasm of affection, regrets, and remembered accounts that might be factually inaccurate but emotionally unfeigned."
The Eternal Daughter,"The Eternal Daughter is a minor film at least partly by design, but it leaves an ethereal trail of sadness and creepiness."
The Eternal Daughter,"The film’s time-and-logic bending finale reveal arrives as a gut punch, with a restrained parting note both ethereal and lifelike."
The Eternal Daughter,"There are as many potential ways to approach a parent-child relationship onscreen as there are parent-child relationships on the planet, but Hogg may have just discovered a new one."
The Eternal Daughter,"This slight story examines the mystery of the mother-daughter bond without getting much closer to solving it, and when the mist clears is revealed to resemble the hotel it haunts, in being elegant but empty, save for those elusive echoes."
The Eternal Daughter,"The more overtly personal Hogg is as a writer/director, the more resonant her work becomes."
The Eternal Daughter,"Where Hogg’s last two movies saw the filmmaker tracing a version of herself from memory, this one sees her tracing a memory from a version of herself."
The Eternal Daughter,"The Eternal Daughter is a serious, gentle moment of self-revelation for Joanna Hogg."
Ted K,A stunning performance by Sharlto Copley... finds emotional mercury in Kaczynski’s boiling cauldron of rage.
Ted K,Sharlto Copleys performance remains riveting throughout.
Ted K,"The film is a tad reductive, leaning too heavily on currently fashionable explanations for why lonely white men resort to violence. But Stone makes up for it with some magnificently eerie moments."
Ted K,"In the well-trod realm of forensic examinations of the notorious, Stone’s considered hike into the life and times of a very American-made extremist does have undeniable power."
Ted K,Even as Stone brings us right to the edge of Teds mind as he documents the brilliant passion curdling into narcissistic madness he knows that we cant fall into the ravine with him.
Ted K,"Tony Stones avoidance of emotional manipulation in dramatizing Ted Kaczynskis terror campaign is admirable, but only up to a point."
Ted K,"On the small screen, it's a quietly involving watch that gives an insight into Kaczynski's troubled mind with an atmospheric intensity; but with less information than a traditional feature or documentary."
Ted K,A biopic that effectively honors its subject with its opaque severity.
Ted K,The half-baked quality of the big picture leads to the conclusion that it may be impossible to ever fully comprehend the motivating factors that led to Kaczynski's fate - and perhaps that's how it belongs.
Ted K,"Copley, also on board as a producer, is captivating in the lead role."
Ted K,Mesmerizing.
Ted K,"It is a riveting, dreamlike evocation of this man's tortured, unhappy life, whose transient successes bring him no pleasure of any kind."
Elvis,"It's all very stylized and flashy and modern, self-consciously hip in a way that's clearly been designed to speak to generations for whom Elvis Presley may not be the King of Rock 'n' Roll so much as the guy on the soundtrack to ""Lilo & Stitch."""
Elvis,"Elvis is hyperbolic, one-dimensional and ludicrous – but as high-excess cinematic myth-making, it’s a blast."
Elvis,"Luhrmann's fast-cutting super-montage style overpowers the subject matter, and the result is an impressionistic, jumbled highlight reel of Presley’s many accomplishments, despite vivid recreations by actor Austin Butler as The King."
Elvis,Baz Luhrmann turns the life of Elvis Aaron Presley into a three-ring circus with more sensation than sense in Elvis. But it’s got a good beat and you can dance to it.
Elvis,"Flashes of color, lightning cuts, and the camera spins and needle drops are at times overwhelming, but it’s an overall enjoyable experience that washes over you in waves of excitement."
Elvis,Baz Luhrmann photobombs this Elvis portrait with over-extravagant filmmaking that dwarfs the iconic rock and roller. And that ain’t easy.
Elvis,"The most anachronistic element of Elvis is its cloying need to assure us that its hero was a good person, as if trying to preemptively counter some imagined onslaught of TikToks about why Elvis Presley is problematic."
Elvis,"Of the actors who have previously tried to bottle Elvis’s lightning-like magic, none has come close to the physical, emotional, electrical energy that throbs through Austin Butler’s titular performance here."
Elvis,"It’s an epic collage of images and sensations, but it is not a movie. Yet despite a surfeit of annoying flaws, I must add that it is also an occasional whale of an extravaganza."
Elvis,"Luhrmann's movie achieves its goals of highlighting Elvis' music while providing a capable, if imperfect, abstract of his life. For fans of the icon and his music, it hits enough sweet spots to be worthy of a theatrical viewing."
Elvis,Elvis is propelled forward — almost maniacally so — by Presley’s music... The relentless music makes the whole thing feel like a montage... But it’s infectious.
Elvis,A wildly over-the-top and extremely entertaining biopic of Elvis Presley.
Elvis,"Elvis, in the epic tradition of all of Luhrmann’s work, is a brash, overwhelming experience... It’s too much. Yet if it were any less excessive, it wouldn’t be as doggedly effective as it often is."
Elvis,"Through Luhrmann’s lens, Elvis transforms from someone striking and fresh to a relic clinging for relevancy in a changing world. Luhrmann presents the familiar narrative with enough verve to make it feel new."
Elvis,Baz Luhrmann brilliantly floods our senses with arresting sights and sounds.
Elvis,"It’s clear Luhrmann is more interested in mythmaking, era-hopping, and genre-melding than he is in trying to dig all that deeply into the complex cultural, racial, and political realities of Presley’s life."
Elvis,"I liked it, though my corneas did feel a little crunchy afterward."
Elvis,"Swept up in the glint of the leather and the bejeweled jumpsuits, Luhrmann overlooks the messy human who hid underneath. And so, he misses out on the heart that could have made his film truly spectacular."
Elvis,Every surface is cleanly wiped. Every fabric seems fresh out of the box. There is no journey to Vegas. We are essentially there from the opening scene.
Elvis,"Baz Luhrmann’s bejeweled battering ram of a biopic is all over the place, which can be distracting, but the grit and grace of Austin Butler’s performance as The King is a thing of beauty. A star is born right here."
Elvis,"Presleyologists will learn nothing here, and purists will find plenty against which to rail. Less knowing viewers, however, may well be sucked in by Luhrmann’s lively telling of the tale."
Elvis,"Instead of dramatizing this subject’s life, it dramatizes the extravagance of moviemaking."
Elvis,"Say this for ""Elvis"": It is never boring. But it also tells us virtually nothing about Presley."
Elvis,Never before has a movie spent such a disproportionate amount of time on a white man doing nothing about the civil rights movement.
Elvis,"When one politically powerful white man claps eyes on the gyrating young Elvis, he asks, “What in God’s sweet name am I looking at?” This remarkable movie suggests one possible answer is the future, in more ways than one."
Elvis,"Luhrmann sees Elvis as a mythic American figure or maybe even a full-on superhero — and he positions the tone of his film accordingly, somewhere between Orson Welles’ ""Citizen Kane"" and Sam Raimi’s ""Spider-Man"" trilogy."
Elvis,"Bloated, gaudy and at times bordering on self-parody. Those missteps, courtesy of director Baz Luhrmann and an ill-used Tom Hanks, squander Austin Butler's brilliant moments in the title role, which deserve a much better movie."
Elvis,"Mr. Luhrmann’s film, in keeping with his cartoonist’s soul, is less a tragedy than a 2.5 hour Looney Tunes offering, with Parker as Bugs Bunny forever outwitting the Elmer Fudd-ish Elvis."
Elvis,Exhilarating! Butler is a revelation.
Elvis,You can’t help falling in love with Austin Butler.
Elvis,"This zany biopic has its longueurs and is no more historically reliable than you’d expect. Still, as an antipodean fever dream it’s significantly more compelling than previous Luhrmann follies like The Great Gatsby or Australia."
Elvis,"Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis is as powerful, passionate and problematic as the man himself. Don’t be afraid to get caught in its trap."
Elvis,"A typical Luhrmann film: lush, grandiose, epic, stylish to the millionth degree."
Elvis,"It accomplishes what it sets out to do in reminding audiences of the power of Elvis Presley. He's Romeo or Gatsby or Satine at the Moulin Rouge. He's impossible to ignore. With Butler as his copilot, Luhrmann sets loins afire."
Elvis,"For most of the movie, Luhrmann fillets incident into montage, his slice-and-dice approach thwarting any possible momentum; we long for a scene that lasts more than ten seconds."
Elvis,"""Elvis"" is able to overcome a good number of its flaws and hiccups by the sheer ferocity of Butler's performance and Luhrmann's dogged determination to entertain."
Elvis,"[It] doesn't just fail at making the so-called King of Rock and Roll into a three-dimensional human being; it actively plunges him further into the recesses of memedom, while making his legacy out to be far less interesting than it actually is."
Elvis,"You may even be begging: Baz, come on, just hold still. But no, we’re off again. I’ve had fever dreams that have been less delirious. But on the plus side, even if it’s never deep or enlightening, it has a fizzing energy."
Elvis,"I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about Elvis. “Elvis,” for all its flaws and compromises, made me want to listen to him, as if for the first time."
Elvis,A very conventional and very overstuffed biopic.
Elvis,There are aspects of Elvis that is cinematic mastery and there are other parts that is bilge. It’s a mess of contradictions as well as being… just a mess.
Elvis,"Visually dazzling biopic of Elvis Presley, but its subject remains maddeningly out of focus."
Elvis,"The result is a dizzying, almost hallucinatory experience — akin to being thrown into a washing machine and mercilessly churned for 2 1/2 hours."
Elvis,"“Elvis” worships its subject, but beneath that worship is a condescension, presumably unconscious, that borders on contempt. Or perhaps the contempt is for itself."
Elvis,"God, the film can be weird. Yet in its cartoonish frenzy, Luhrmann does actually capture how thrilling and subversive the early Presley must have been."
Elvis,Elvis is structured like a nearly three-hour sizzle reel. It doesn’t so much have scenes as suites. It moves.
Elvis,"This is everything you might expect of a Baz Luhrmann biopic. It’s brash, loud, maximalist, and certainly never boring, but also keeps its subject at a distance, enthralled by his glamour not his soul."
Elvis,"It’s overstuffed, bloated, and succumbs to trite biopic decisions."
Elvis,"“Elvis” isn’t just a reinvigoration of the Elvis myth, it’s a resurrection of the King himself. Left the building? Not if Baz Luhrmann has anything to say about it."
Elvis,"“Elvis” is like watching a good Elvis impersonator, not really like watching the King himself."
Elvis,"It’s extraordinary how Luhrmann is able to tell this story honestly, while still making it palatable. It’s equally extraordinary that he can take this short and tragically misdirected life and make it feel like a triumph."
Elvis,"An overlong, narrative mess as excessive as one of the King's fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches. However, with Butler’s stellar portrayal, it’s never dull, and more enjoyable than not."
Elvis,"We get no real insight into the internal lives of either characters; there’s an emptiness to the film when Elvis is not on stage. That could be the point of the movie, but it never acknowledges it."
Elvis,"Elvis is too long, too melodramatic, too everything. But it’s also often wildly entertaining."
Elvis,"The protracted rubbernecking at Elvis’s inexorable decline epitomizes a film that regularly backs away from its keenest observations about the icon to merely, and superficially, bask in his star power."
Elvis,"Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis” is more than all right, mama. It blasts the screen with the Aussie director’s trademark glitter and bravado but also hits the right historical and musical notes for a biopic worthy of a legendary performer."
Elvis,"Raw, gyrating machismo turned Elvis into a god with the power to bring teenyboppers to instantaneous orgasm with a swing of the hips. Under Luhrmann's unthrottled tutelage, that overwhelming dynamo of charisma is made merely loud."
Elvis,"What happens when the director of Moulin Rouge! makes a film about Elvis? A lot of shake, rattle and razzmatazz."
Elvis,"As a strict 100% factual biopic, Elvis is probably a failure. But as a biography of an idea, it’s as much a triumph as you could hope for, a work of controlled and sustained mad love for an artist whose story is never-ending."
Elvis,"Surface-level take on The King, but a great time nonetheless."
Elvis,"When Austin Butler shakes his hips in Elvis’s first gig as a full-blown rock ‘n’ roller, it’s like watching two stars being born."
Elvis,"It may well be a star-making turn for [Austin Butler], a bold announcement of thespian vigor and ingenuity that even devoted fans of The Carrie Diaries didn’t know he had. A shame, then, that Luhrmann works so hard to drown him out."
Elvis,"To complain that “Elvis” is basically a compilation of musical-biopic conventions is a bit like complaining about a greatest-hits album; it also misses... [Luhrmann’s] ability to suffuse clichés with sincerity, energy and feeling."
Elvis,"There’s enough energy and flash... to overcome most nit-picking, and Butler throws himself into a performance that’s wildly physical but never cartoonish or disrespectful."
Elvis,"As it is, this is just another exercise in Elvis impersonation, its upper lip twitching to no purpose."
Elvis,Luhrmann has never been an accomplished dramatist. He has the instincts of a pop video supremo. And in pop god Elvis Presley he may have found his perfect subject.
Elvis,[Butler's] keen instinct for melodrama and burn-the-screen-down charisma give his Elvis a midcentury Method-acting rawness.
Elvis,"While you won’t find all that much truth in Baz Luhrmann’s cradle-to-grave dramatisation of his life, the Australian filmmaker has delivered something far more compelling: an American fairytale."
Elvis,Sometimes Elvis feels like a lost Oliver Stone film from his daring 1990s heyday: a big-canvas exploration of debauched American appetites.
Elvis,"A fizzy, delirious, impishly energized, compulsively watchable 2-hour-and-39-minute fever dream -- a spangly pinwheel of a movie that converts the Elvis saga we all carry around in our heads into a lavishly staged biopic-as-pop-opera."
Elvis,"If the writing too seldom measures up to the astonishing visual impact, the affinity the director feels for his showman subject is both contagious and exhausting."
Elvis,"It finds so little reason for Presley’s life to be the stuff of a Baz Luhrmann movie that the equation ultimately inverts itself, leaving us with an Elvis Presley movie about Baz Luhrmann. They both deserve better."
Elvis,"Luhrmann’s colourful house style can be frantic and shallow, but his desire to get our knickers in a twist, here, feels honest-to-god urgent. This is the most substantial thing he’s done since Romeo + Juliet."
A Chiara,"The plot is sluggish, but the film’s credibility is always intriguing."
A Chiara,A solid film bolstered by its gripping central performance.
A Chiara,"Jonas Carpignano’s impressive, slow-burning drama captures a milieu that is bound by rules that have little to do with the laws of the land."
A Chiara,This gripping and emotive drama follows Chiara’s attempts to come to terms with her father’s criminal legacy...
A Chiara,Another very impressive achievement from Carpignano.
A Chiara,"I never knew where it was going, and I was gripped... It was just so well done."
A Chiara,"Carpignano delivers a fascinating take and perspective in familiar territory, focusing on how a crime family’s fallout affects a young girl’s sense of self."
A Chiara,The limiting style and characterizations in A Chiara are only so thoughtful.
A Chiara,What’s best about “A Chiara” is its totality of naturalism and subjectivity — how it humanely complicates a teenager’s newfound self-possession...
A Chiara,"The essence of the film is Chiara watching and learning, and watching Swamy Rotolo observe is simply a marvel. With her dark eyes and eyebrows, she delivers truly fierce face, like all the great Italian actresses that came before her."
A Chiara,"In the neorealist tradition, “A Chiara” is a slice-of-life drama built around an idea and animated by a profound moral quandary."
A Chiara,"'A Chiara' contemplates a character who is forced to grow up too fast, acknowledging the cost of family secrets and weighing the consequences of upholding a status quo that obscures reality."
A Chiara,"Carpignano’s script is put together with an ingenuity that deftly avoids every looming cliche. He doesn’t romanticise the mafia’s corruption or its violence, but he doesn’t sensationalise it either."
A Chiara,"However uncertain we may be about who Chiara is or ultimately decides to become, Carpignano's trilogy has made it powerfully clear just how far that decision will resonate."
A Chiara,"The film's initial aimlessness is pleasurable for the way that it allows the viewer to stare at life being processed on the stunned, confused, and ecstatic face of a teenager."
A Chiara,"""A Chiara"" will likely expand the director's visibility and send people back to watching his earlier features."
Poser,"Ultimately, it's as profound as the stoned guy on a couch, musing on the taste difference between a single chip folded on itself and two chips stacked."
Poser,"No real person acts or looks like Lennon does, not until you’ve blown up their human qualities to a hatefully over-sized scale."
Poser,A drifting psychodrama whose menace builds with excruciating slowness.
Poser,"This is no navel-gazing, regional subcultural circle jerk; sometimes dark, frequently self-depreciative and often dryly funny, there is a sad, bleak heart to Poser that is where its ultimate impact is contained."
Poser,[An] intriguing psychodrama about fitting in and finding a voice.
Poser,"Spiky, funny, feverish, and more than a little nail-biting."
Poser,"The whole thing is oddly beautiful, absurdly compelling and even freakishly watchable."
Ali and Ava,"Barnard maintains her tough, realistic approach even as she guides this love story... Movies so rarely show us something as wonderfully, believably ordinary as Ali and Ava's love — which is precisely why it feels so extraordinary."
Ali and Ava,"Barnard has made an ode to the beauty of messy, imperfect lives and their ability to converge at improbably perfect moments. Maybe it ends a beat too soon, but then so do some of your favorite songs."
Ali and Ava,"What’s most satisfying about the movie is getting to know Ali and Ava separately. They’re endowed with warmth, depth and believability by Akhtar and Rushbrook, veteran supporting actors who are rarely cast in leading roles."
Ali and Ava,"In its understated way, the movie is a celebration of the miracle of connection."
Ali and Ava,"Its two protagonists initially seem like unlikely leads, but they embody a grounded emotional warmth that feels genuine."
Ali and Ava,"This understated indie film clings uncomfortably to the surface of their relationship, yet still delivers something pure, melodic and precise."
Ali and Ava,There’s an authenticity to Ali & Ava’s unshowy love story that hits deeper because it’s a drama that really could belong to anyone.
Ali and Ava,In the end this is a heart-warming film about seizing that second chance in life and not letting go.
Ali and Ava,"However long it takes the characters to put their feelings into action, there’s no mistaking the warm, teasing chemistry between Adeel Akhtar and Claire Rushbrook, who star as Ali and Ava respectively."
Ali and Ava,A pair of wonderfully winning performances from Claire Rushbrook and Adeel Akhtar lie at the heart of this unexpectedly warm and typically compelling drama from British writer-director Clio Barnard.
Ali and Ava,"Unusually for a film in this tradition, it makes almost no economic or political references either, staying committed to its own world. The optimism is endearing, though."
Ali and Ava,Barnard’s script is crammed with humour and unexpected details.
Ali and Ava,"Most viewers will get on okay with Ali & Ava, which has moments of passing beauty in Ole Bratt Birkeland’s cinematography, of blurred lights through rain on ambient night drives."
Ali and Ava,"A tender tale with two brilliant leads, and one of Barnard’s finest films to date."
Ali and Ava,"Akhtar and Rushbrook give crystalline performances, their characters looking at each other and seeing the chance to be their own whole selves."
Ali and Ava,"A compassionate and tenderly performed love story, with a musical current coursing through it. British cinema is lucky to have Clio Barnard."
Ali and Ava,"With a certain sense of whimsy and an exceptional ability to tell a unique love story, writer-director Clio Barnard gives two lost souls a new chance at romance."
Ali and Ava,The performances make this worthwhile.
Ali and Ava,"Akhtar imbues Ali with such an aliveness, an electric joyfulness teetering on the edge of sorrow, that he is a whole enough character to fill any unintentional gaps."
Ali and Ava,"You wish this couple well; you wish them a future together where there will be song, and happiness."
Ali and Ava,"Only going from strength to strength, Ali & Ava is another extraordinary achievement in Barnard's unrelentingly impressive filmography."
Ali and Ava,"A quiet study of its characters, Ali & Ava is a fresh take on otherwise well-worn rom-com narratives."
Ali and Ava,Ali & Ava once again showcases Clio Barnard's uncanny ability to capture the insoluble complexities of life.
Ali and Ava,Ali & Ava is a charmer: Barnard's most accessible and hopeful film to date.
Ali and Ava,[Filmmaker Clio Barnard] draws her characters and their worlds like an expert storyteller.
Ali and Ava,Barnard's film is an essay in acceptance and love.
Ali and Ava,Ali & Ava has an undeniable and attractive glow of authenticity.
Ali and Ava,"It's a tender and, eventually, joyful film, powered by two extraordinarily lived-in performances from Akhtar and Rushbrook."
After Yang,ERROR
Memoria,"One sequence, set by a riverside outside of Bogotá, depicts the thin line between life and death with heart-stopping clarity, making us aware of the smallest physical movements that prove more mesmerizing and rewarding than the typical spectacle..."
Memoria,It’s a beautiful work of cinematic concentration that’s purely Apichatpong.
Memoria,"You get caught up in it. You don’t ask why. You don’t wonder what’s going on, what will happen next. You just accept it. You trust Weerasethakul. Until about the 100-minute mark (the runtime is 136 minutes), he justifies that trust."
Memoria,Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s latest is more elusive and even more enveloping than his other beguiling films.
Memoria,It's mesmerizing and definitely not for everyone.
Memoria,"Everything in Memoria is far more calculated than you might first suspect, above all its sounds -- which are not just the subject of the film but its substance, finely textured in ways that seem intended to bypass the conscious mind."
Memoria,“Memoria” finally reveals itself as a vision from the future — a declaration of faith in a medium that hasn’t lost its power to astonish.
Memoria,"Even for the most adventurous viewers, it may prove taxing. But to embrace its strange singularity yields a thought-provoking experience, and perhaps even a transformative one."
Memoria,"True to its title, “Memoria’s” theme is memory and its shifting seams and sandlike substrate, on which the footing of the film — and, by extension, our footing as well — is never terribly sure."
Memoria,"""Memoria"" plays out almost like a hallucination... This enigmatic film is more attuned to mood than narrative. But even if ""Memoria"" is perplexing, it is also incredibly provocative and quietly powerful."
Memoria,"Like all of Weerasethakul’s movies, Memoria leaves you feeling like an out-of-body adventurer, tethered by only a slender thread of consciousness to the physical form in the movie seat."
Memoria,Te existential mystery of Memoria is universally applicable. Weerasethakul is unpacking a sensation everyone has probably experienced at one point in their life: the feeling that something is cosmically out of whack.
Memoria,Swinton fully immerses herself in Apichatpong’s vision and soundscape.
Memoria,"Weerasethakul leaves us trembling on the edge of uncertainty, providing just enough terra firma to keep the viewer engaged while leading them deeper into the realms of the unknown."
Memoria,"Designed and deserving to be seen big and loud, Memoria is a hypnotic, unquantifiable, occasionally inpenetrable sonic odyssey from a unique cinematic voice."
Memoria,"If anything, it's a living deja vu. Or the closest cinema can get to that disquieting sensation of meeting someone you're convinced you've encountered before."
Memoria,Top marks must go to the star Tilda Swinton... who energises the entire movie. And it needs her. For the ideas here are huge.
Memoria,"Rarely less than intriguing, the film transports you more than once to somewhere else entirely, and Swinton is the glue - even if the last act is such slow cinema it all but sets in place."
Memoria,How smoothly Memoria loops together all its unexpected moments is mostly rewarding. But that ending! It is a hurdle that inches the film from profundity toward tediousness.
Memoria,Rarely have a filmmaker and performer been so completely on the same page as Tilda Swinton and Apichatpong Weerasethakul are here.
Memoria,"""Memoria"" demands patience and attention. I found it an emotionally wrenching and intellectually fulfilling experience, but not one I can easily summarize or classify..."
Memoria,"Not since Todd Haynes' Safe has a murkily understood, possibly psychosomatic ailment been reconceived in so haunting and unforgettable a fashion."
Memoria,"At times, Weerasethakul's long takes and subtle observations seem to tune a viewer's perceptions to a hidden realm of being."
Memoria,"Swinton-whose roles in the past decade have been marked by maximalist acting flourishes-appears revitalized by Weerasethakul's signature hush and placidity. The tranquility, though, exists only on a superficial level; so much roils underneath."
Memoria,Weerasethakul's film is a feast of a sonic landscape
Memoria,It's a beautiful work of cinematic concentration that's purely Apichatpong.
Memoria,The celebrated Thai auteur's first English-language feature -- and his first to be made outside of his home country -- is as entrancing and wonderfully perplexing as any of his previous pictures.
Memoria,"In his own precise, abstract manner, Apichatpong has made an ecological disaster movie about the danger involved in ignoring the natural state of things and the people who respect it."
Memoria,"It's an exercise in mindfulness that asks you to give yourself over to it lock, stock and barrel. If you're willing to do that, you can cancel that meditation course."
Memoria,"From Memoria's attention-grabbing opening onwards, Apichatpong's latest feature proves to be by far his most accessible."
Memoria,"Again in a Weerasethakul film, we find spirits lurking behind the everyday world, but in Memoria, they might just be repressed memories emanating from a world that never actually forgets."
Memoria,Memoria is high-minded titillation of a sort that happened to find favor with artistic sophisticates. But it still feels like a cute little game calculated to captivate a special few.
Memoria,"Memoria lulls you into its rhythms, gives you the sparse outlines of an intellectual framework, then hits you with the full weight of accumulated lyricism that must be pure cinema."
Memoria,"The 'Uncle Boonmee' director broadens his horizons, but not so much his themes, in this Colombia-set collaboration with Tilda Swinton."
Memoria,"It is cinema that, if you let it, can check our heartbeats, frustrate our minds and connect with our very souls."
Memoria,"Watching this film reminded me of when I was 17, hearing Revolution 9 on The White Album for the first time. It left a residue of happiness in my heart."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The PG-13-ness of Where the Crawdads Sing buffs every rough edge off this story—the abuse, the abandonment, the betrayal, the sex, and even the alleged murder. It would be better off as trash."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Edgar-Jones’ easygoing allure isn’t enough to bind Where the Crawdads Sing together, though, leaving the film a generic, dull outing."
Where the Crawdads Sing,This film is like the Instagram-influencer version of [Beasts of a Southern Wild] — a Goop post about its beautifying effects.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A flat, flair-free and uninspiring adaptation."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Like the backdrop – marsh or swamp – it’s all a bit soggy.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A fairly engrossing entertainment -- a little bit slick and doesn't go in depth into the marsh.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Newman’s vision of rural South Carolina is scrubbed so clean you might as well call it #swampcore.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"... Even Edgar-Jones, at times firing on all cylinders as enfant sauvage Kya Clark, can’t quite save this much-hyped adaptation from an overdose of syrup and some deeply dubious subtext."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Everything feels both fussy and perfunctory, and not a bit of it real."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Overall one can’t help but notice that Newman’s adaptation feels too clean, too glossy and too neatly packed to be in any way plausible, even with a fair amount of suspension of disbelief."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I’d rather eat a box of Caran d’Ache pencils than rewatch this mess.
Where the Crawdads Sing,The book’s cliches have won out and all the literary elements that made it unique have completely evaporated. Film is remorseless when it comes to stripping a novel down to its essentials.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"You never feel Kya’s connection to her environment, even though I’m guessing that should be of utmost importance. For a film about what it is to be wild it’s incredibly tame. Plus you don’t even encounter any crawdads."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Box-fresh and laundered to a fault, the blandly attractive characters spend their time wandering along shorelines as if in an evasive American television commercial for prescription incontinence medicine."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A run-of-the-mill drama would be acceptable to many audiences who are looking for a diverting couple of hours, but it’s not going to cut it when the source material is so beloved,"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Plays like an all-white reboot of To Kill a Mockingbird with Edgar-Jones somehow getting to play Scout and Tom Robinson at the same time. And the big twist ending is an outrageously evasive cheat.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"There are a host of other things wrong with the film, from poor pacing, to a lack of character depth, to heavy-handed themes...but Jones does her best with what she has to work with, and it may still strike an emotional chord if they don’t look closely."
Where the Crawdads Sing,This 125-minute movie feels longer than that.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Slow, almost lazy, gothic kind of feel to it and I just wish it had more."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Kya’s [world] is so toothless and the aesthetic so rote that it feels like the creation of a committee of Instagrammers.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"What emerges on the screen lacks the pace, suspense and humor it needs to keep a general audience alert and riveted."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Where the Crawdads Sing is an old-school Southern melodrama told in big, broad brushstrokes."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The movie is resolutely faithful to the incidents of the novel, but it doesn’t seem particularly interested in standing on its own, in being a movie. It feels like an illustration more than an adaptation."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where the Crawdads Sing is not without flaws but it draws the viewer into its specific time and place and offers an engaging two-hour escape into the life of a memorable individual. More movies today could learn from such an “old-fashioned” approach.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"""Stupefyingly bad.... It is very much like a swamp: tepid and unmoving."""
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Detached from the lush nature writing in the book, the story’s plot beats stand exposed as bland contrivances familiar from a thousand romance novels about plucky, adorable damsels versus snaky and duplicitous men."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The film's script ultimately bounces between a knowing artificiality and a frustrating dutifulness. In a way, that’s apt for an adaptation of a novel with both an outlandish plot and a troubling backstory."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Where the Crawdads Sing is a heartfelt, and gorgeous picture, the kind which major studios used to make all the time, and now feel like a bit of an endangered species."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The movie has a careless, over-lit quality, and its director, Olivia Newman, doesn’t bring any mystique to the Louisiana locations that stand in for North Carolina... She has made a tourist board promo."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A cross between The Notebook, Fried Green Tomatoes and To Kill a Mockingbird, the romance will satisfy fans of the book but suffers from abuse overload."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The same ethical solipsism that enabled Owens’ past adventures abroad presides over Crawdads, and Newman’s film can’t escape it, either."
Where the Crawdads Sing,It is … acceptable.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Newman bathes the story in so many broad, dusty tropes and odd tonal shifts that nothing really feels real for a moment."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"While Where the Crawdads Sing is rich in atmosphere, it’s sorely lacking in actual substance or suspense."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The Delia Owens bestseller about sex and murder in the Carolinas comes to the screen as an antiseptic, airbrushed, miscast misfire that takes so few risks with the publishing phenom that it feels more embalmed than a freshly imagined version of the book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Those who do not already have a strong emotional commitment to the story are likely to come away finding the film superficial at best and morally bankrupt at worst.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Where the Crawdads Sing may be a chick flick in some people’s estimation, but I was thoroughly absorbed and recommend it highly."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Daisy Edgar-Jones’ performance and the gorgeous imagery redeem a book adaptation that’s uneven and sometimes implausible.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A strong, satisfying film welcomes movie audiences into the world of the marsh."
Where the Crawdads Sing,After an interminable wind-up... the bombshell ending is rewarding.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"All the buzz and talent around a tale that’s sold more than 12 million copies can’t thoroughly mask a sometimes corny, often clunky script, even if most of the lines are delivered by Daisy Edgar-Jones."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"It’s Southern-fried “The Blue Lagoon” meets “Murder, She Wrote” — and topped off with a sprinkling of “To Kill a Mockingbird.”"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Oh, the crawdads definitely sing in ""Where the Crawdads Sing."" Much of the time, you wish they'd shut the hell up."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The more involved the plot becomes, and it becomes quite involved, the slower the movie gets. “Crawdads” is Olivia Newman’s debut as a feature-film director, and it shows."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"For a story about sex, murder, family secrets and class resentments, the temperature is awfully mild, as if a Tennessee Williams play had been sent to Nicholas Sparks for a rewrite."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"This is a satisfying production that’s one part mystery, two parts romance and, ultimately, a message movie about being kind and embracing outsiders."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Unfortunately, this ripe-for-adaptation melodrama has been flattened, de-juiced and otherwise withered into a massively banal and flavorless porridge."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A finger-lickin’ family bucket of southern-fried twaddle.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where the Crawdads Sing spins a soapy yet dramatically inert and often tone-deaf yarn about societal rejection and female empowerment in the wetlands of North Carolina.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The result effectively overcomes its Lifetime-movie vibe, without feeling like something anyone needs to rush to a theater to consume."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"We don’t need a sweaty Tennessee Williams hothouse for these flowers, but such a torrid story set in such an anodyne South feels all sorts of wrong. Who wants a room-temperature barn-burner?"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"For a whole mess of reasons, the film is neither heartbreaking nor thrilling, often feeling like a blown-up version of a Hallmark flick-of-the-week, its ambitions far greater than its capabilities."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Though it is faithful, “Where the Crawdads Sing” is lacking the essential character and storytelling connective tissue that makes a story like this work — an adaptation such as this cannot survive on plot alone."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"This is the most basic kind of novel adaptation: rote and dutiful, reliant on memories of the book rather than creating a texture of its own. It is implied that characters are interesting -- it’s insisted, really -- but we never quite see it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A solid murder mystery with rich characters and a vivid Southern backdrop.
Where the Crawdads Sing,[Where the Crawdads Sing] plays more like a glossy Nicholas Sparks-flavored melodrama than a tale that actually has any meaningful connection to the messy real world — wetland or otherwise.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A sparkless romance, a limp murder mystery and a deadly dull courtroom drama all rolled into one, with little to grab onto or hold viewers' interests. Talk about singing the Carolina blues."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"As a movie, Where the Crawdads Sing never seems worthy of the hullabaloo that continues to surround the book, but -- much like its heroine -- Newman’s adaptation finds just enough ways to endure."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The performances in general renounce nuance for theatricality, and most storytelling decisions unfurl like a subpar pastiche of vague components we’ve seen and heard plenty of times before."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A lot of this gutless, often silly, film’s issues are the book’s, beautifully realized and thus reified by trying to make what is essentially a mud-splattered, civil rights-era fairy tale into a lifelike story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where the Crawdads Sing is the kind of tedious moral fantasy that fuels America’s misguided idealism.
Where the Crawdads Sing,This is a movie about fighting back against male intransigence that has the courage of its outsider spirit.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"The biggest faults of Where The Crawdad Sings are ultimately the ones it inherited from the book—a challenge to reconcile when changes risk betraying the integrity, even identity, of the source material."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A movie must stand on its own. “Where the Crawdads Sing” tries, but it can't quite do so."
On the Count of Three,"Simultaneously funny, depressing, and life-affirming, On the Count of Three isn’t a macabre masterpiece like, say, Barry, but it scratches a similar itch."
On the Count of Three,"Very well acted, with a refreshingly dark sense of humour and briskly paced, the film impresses on a number of levels."
On the Count of Three,"Comfort has never felt more discomforting than it does in On the Count of Three, a profound new comedy about suicide, mental health, depression, and the absurd lengths we go to help the strange people we love."
On the Count of Three,"On the Count of Three works more than it doesn’t, though the film, which is reaching theaters almost a year and a half after its Sundance 2021 debut, feels like something that its director and star has already outgrown."
On the Count of Three,Carmichael takes the unhappiness of these men seriously. That’s the precise needle the movie threads: It finds comedy in two people at the very end of their ropes without turning their depression into the butt of the joke.
On the Count of Three,A rousing tragicomedy that straddles a line between incredibly calibrated gallows humor and a devastating discourse on the burden of existence.
On the Count of Three,It's bleak to the point of nothingness.
On the Count of Three,"Carmichael clearly hasn’t set out to trivialize a serious subject. But the film may inadvertently end up doing that, by delivering a message that can be boiled down to a platitude..."
On the Count of Three,"It’s the acting that keeps the film afloat. Carmichael is a multifaceted talent, and one wonders what he’ll do next -- especially if next time his name is on the script, as well."
On the Count of Three,"The filmmakers don’t invest any time depicting what depression might actually look and feel like, so that those who suffer from it can recognize it, and those who don’t can empathize."
On the Count of Three,"With queries about trauma, loyalty, and race on its mind, On the Count of Three achieves something near impossible in its conclusion, distilling its themes into something both heartbreaking and disarmingly hopeful."
On the Count of Three,"What's on view lacks a well thought-out progression, insightful performances, astute directing, memorable cinematography or precise editing."
On the Count of Three,You really have to know what you're doing if you're going to make a comedy out of a suicide pact between two friends.
On the Count of Three,The chemistry between Abbot and Carmichael makes for buddy-movie magic.
On the Count of Three,"Despite its abundant artistic shortcomings, On the Count of Three connects on strictly emotional and sociological levels with feelings of despair and pointlessness."
On the Count of Three,A true marvel of pitch-black comedy.
On the Count of Three,"While the premise of the feature debut from actor and comedian Carmichael might seem crass for a comedy, there's an unexpected soulfulness in the execution."
On the Count of Three,"Shot in intimate 35mm, the whole thing is almost shockingly short (just over 80 minutes), and the style sort of poetically raw, like an old Jim Jarmusch movie."
On the Count of Three,"Jerrod Carmichael is a volatile director and an electric actor, but Ari Katcher and Ryan Welch's screenplay routinely force the characters into formulaic, trivializing scenarios."
On the Count of Three,"On the Count of Three is proof that Carmichael is a director to be excited about, hoping that perhaps he finds time to write his next script himself."
On the Count of Three,"""On the Count of Three"" doesn't overcome its directorial deficiencies."
On the Count of Three,An imperfect but serious-minded debut.
On the Count of Three,"This absurdity isn't easy to capture on screen, and On the Count of Three is an uneven movie, not quite sure how to balance its bleak subject matter with the comedy credentials of its writers and director/star."
On the Count of Three,"""On the Count of Three"" can ultimately afford the temerity to thread the needle between comedy and desolation because of how Abbott and Carmichael work together."
On the Count of Three,It's a lark of desperation that gives you a lift.
On the Count of Three,Carmichael takes on a challenging mix of tones and mostly succeeds as the story segues from the tragic to the comic and back again.
Summering,The ending is a tiresome new-agey cop-out and a lot of viable ideas have gone to waste. A disappointment.
Summering,"With its rare focus on girls’ friendship and growing up, 'Summering' has good intentions but that never actually makes it a good movie. Girls are owed their own 'Stand by Me,' but they deserve so much better than this."
Summering,"A movie that ultimately goes nowhere, with a narrative that too obviously echoes Stand by Me and underdeveloped characters whose stories and interactions never gel."
Summering,"That ethereal sort of thing could get gloopy and sentimental, but “Summering” balances the bucolic stuff with bits of acidic humor."
Summering,"""Summering"" is a bit of a drifter's tale itself, aiming for the kind of vibey, daydream-like feel of, say, David Robert Mitchell's ""The Myth of the American Sleepover,"" but coming up well shy of that mark."
Summering,The nostalgia of Ponsoldt's film is curdled and rotten underneath its summery sheen.
Summering,"The script by James Ponsoldt and Northfield's Ben Percy beautifully captures a sense of longing and loss, giving the girls and their mothers distinctive voices."
Summering,"Whereas Rob Reiner’s classic coming-of-age film romanticized a decades-bygone era, Ponsoldt finds the same magically complicated mash-up of naiveté and depth in a contemporary setting."
Summering,"Though admirable in its attempt to capture that hazy, searching quality of the purgatory between childhood and adolescence, “Summering” is also, as a result, sleepy and adrift."
Summering,Summering still captures the gentle doom of being aware that your life is about change forever.
Summering,"'Summering' may be a breezy little trip through the nostalgia of youth, but its stabs at deeper meaning are woefully immature."
Summering,"Summering works better as a mood than it does a movie, succeeding in channeling a certain feeling of transition despite ambling, or occasionally stumbling though more traditional kids-flicks narrative beats."
Summering,"""Summering"" is a very nice movie - sweet, affectionate, nostalgic, harmless, but ""nice"" and ""compelling,"" sadly, are not the same thing."
Summering,Summering fails to find that realistic flow that a film like this needs to work.
Summering,"As is, ""Summering"" is too scattered and silly for us to really care."
Summering,"Too much of ""Summering""... plays out in an unsatisfying middle ground: embedded neither in real life, nor in its heroines' restless, malleable imaginations."
Summering,"Alas, its potential for magic is dulled by uneven performances, unconvincing chemistry and an uninspiring script."
Summering,"A coming of age drama which brings a female-led freshness to some undeniably dark elements, and wears its thematic similarities to Stand By Me lightly."
Butter,"Butter limits itself to an artificial set-up and a superficial level of storytelling, more afterschool special than feature film."
Butter,"For all its ache and churning emotions, “Butter” winds up being little more than a meager “Afterschool Special.”"
Butter,"Ultimately, it is, like its conflicted hero, sweet and likable, and you wish it well."
Butter,"While it may resonate for some young viewers, anyone whose reality really resembles that of the film's protagonist should probably look elsewhere."
All My Puny Sorrows,"Alison Pill just tears it up in this. She is funny, raw, and complex."
All My Puny Sorrows,"Where many films would use this as a springboard for a tedious moral treatise on a hot-button issue, “All My Puny Sorrows” keeps the focus commendably and non-judgmentally personal."
All My Puny Sorrows,"The ensemble builds believable chemistry as intimate family members, and when their characters deliver their arguments for life or death, the stakes feel appropriately high."
All My Puny Sorrows,"While the adaptation is, in many ways, quite skilled, the pace of All My Puny Sorrows is so stately, and the overall tone so reserved, that it results in an emotionally muted film."
All My Puny Sorrows,I love this movie like a person. It pierced my heart the way certain paintings or pieces of music do. The way standing at the foot of a mountain does.
All My Puny Sorrows,"All My Puny Sorrows, in some ways, feels like a spiritual companion piece to Petite Maman, but it exposes the blood passed down through raw generational wounds that can never heal."
All My Puny Sorrows,Director Michael McGowan struggles to deliver Toews's inimitable voice... and only occasionally produces breakthrough scenes where humour and sorrow merge.
All My Puny Sorrows,Why sit there sighing as the actors strain to make Toews' prose sound like naturalistic dialogue when you could go straight to the source and read them on the page?
Death on the Nile,"""Theres so much good mixed in with the uncomfortable of this film that one cannot call it a hard pass. But an easy-going river cruise, this aint."""
Death on the Nile,It's very well done... It's darker and meaner than the original Agatha Christie [novel].
Death on the Nile,"Branagh remains a sublime Poirot, and his direction of the material is frequently marvelous."
Death on the Nile,Not a whisker out of place...
Death on the Nile,"As a whole, Death on the Nile has flaws that outweigh its old-fashioned charm."
Death on the Nile,"The camera whirls giddily, dizzy from the sparkle and spectacle, but not quite able to conceal the fact that this is an empty bauble of a movie."
Death on the Nile,That gaudy style — combined with the melodrama of the script’s modified take on Christie’s plot — remains diverting even if some of the supposedly Egyptian backdrops look phoney.
Death on the Nile,"Having just returned from two weeks in Egypt, I can tell you the only thing they got right is the scenery."
Death on the Nile,"While the gamble Branagh takes in disinterring Poirot’s long-neglected sensitive side may be regarded as sacrilege by some, I think it works. Poirot has a yearning heart."
Death on the Nile,"Branagh seems to be having a grand old time, so we might as well, too."
Death on the Nile,"The cast is game, the setting is luxe, the direction is a little fussy, but the whole thing feels slightly… routine."
Death on the Nile,Even a lackluster script and dodgy computer effects cant screw up the retro bliss doled out by director and star Kenneth Branagh as he sets sail for Egypt with an all-star cast that keeps you guessing whodunit.
Death on the Nile,"[Death on the Nile] has pizazz and period style in the same way today’s big-brand toothpastes have flavor -- artificial ingredients give them a taste that’s discernible, but too generic to name."
Death on the Nile,This whodunit mostly becomes a who-cares.
Death on the Nile,Ultimately it’s Branagh’s direction that makes the story a success.
Death on the Nile,"For all the problems here, Death on the Nile is more successful than Branaghs earlier Poirot adventure. The action is livelier. The humour is sharper. The cast seem more energised."
Death on the Nile,"Die-hard Christie purists may be disappointed by some of the changes but, on the whole, Death on the Nile is faithful enough to tell the story and different enough to work better with modern-day concerns about diversity than the original text."
Death on the Nile,"Death On The Nile often feels clunky, overinflated and very silly in parts. Granted there are some decent performances, mainly courtesy of Okonedo. Gadot and Mackey, but on the whole, the film simply fails to present a valid reason for its existence."
Death on the Nile,"It is beautiful to look at, and to listen to, with a superb soundtrack that includes sultry songs by a nightclub performer (Sophie Okonedo, the highlight of the film)."
Death on the Nile,"Death on the Nile has its joys and flaws apart from that Armie factor, but it’s almost like trying to assess whether the appetizer course could have been slightly undercooked while an elephant stampedes over the whole dinner table."
Death on the Nile,Branagh has killed again. He’s once again taken a perfect whodunit and mangled it beyond recognition into some sort of a mummified thriller.
Death on the Nile,"Branagh plays fair with viewers, lingering over crucial clues to make sure they register, and he gives ""Nile"" a sense of place that the 1978 film lacked."
Death on the Nile,"True to their main modes of transportation, if the last one was a speeding train, this one is definitely a leisurely riverboat."
Death on the Nile,Forgets the simple pleasures of ensemble excess and pure messing about.
Death on the Nile,"The cast of characters is a predictable mixed bag of types updated to include persons of color, but Branagh eschews an all-star approach in filling those roles in his pursuit of something other than pomp and circumstance."
Death on the Nile,Can a movie that runs just a few minutes longer than two hours feel padded? “Death on the Nile” does.
Death on the Nile,"The crime’s solution is fine and dandy, but it’s Poirot himself who most fascinates."
Death on the Nile,"I liked “Death on the Nile” a fair bit more than Branagh’s previous Christie film, partly because it’s a less predictable and schematic narrative to begin with, and partly because Branagh the actor has a way of outfoxing his own pedestrian direction."
Death on the Nile,"Much of the cast are spare parts before the gunplay begins. But the star-director is everywhere, the obsessive rough edges of this Poirot smoothed to avuncular wisdom."
Death on the Nile,Insultingly pedestrian. Suchet forever.
Death on the Nile,A murder-mystery that is only deathly in its relative dullness.
Death on the Nile,"the rest of the characters are unfortunately as disposable as this pulp mystery feels, despite its epic ambitions."
Death on the Nile,"Branagh has delivered a polished follow-up to his earlier Christie excursion that won't win any awards, but which seems to bring this conjoined chapter to a satisfying close."
Death on the Nile,"As it is, this Death on the Nile, for too long an affected and strained entertainment lacking any sense of place, floats well downstream from more bracingly constructed whodunits."
Death on the Nile,"Branagh’s second Agatha Christie adaption is a classy, captivating whodunit."
Death on the Nile,Its strengths remain evident in its classy source material and Branagh’s enjoyable take on its hero detective.
Death on the Nile,"A sort of sumptuous dinner-theater redux studded with stray bits of caricature, camp, and many CG pyramids."
Death on the Nile,"Christie’s cool flint is swapped out for tearful ruminations on lost love in Death on the Nile, an intermittently entertaining but otherwise tiresomely lugubrious trip down crocodile-filled waters."
Death on the Nile,"The kindest thing we could with Death on the Nile, after all that’s happened to it, would be to move on and forget."
Death on the Nile,Branagh’s lush take on the musty material looks great and registers a pulse.
Death on the Nile,"As the narrative gears grind through like the slow and steady paddle boat, there’s a sense that Branagh has lost a lot of the fun of Agatha Christie along with his passport..."
Death on the Nile,“Death on the Nile” works because of how effortlessly — and sometimes even charmingly — it bridges the gap between old-fashioned entertainment and modern appetites.
Death on the Nile,"The film is satisfying enough, though more so as glossy, old-school entertainment than diabolically clever mystery."
Death on the Nile,"Branagh’s indulgences can grate, but you also sense how much he loves it all, which helps."
Death on the Nile,"If a viewer didn’t know better, they might assume they were seeing the fourth or fifth entry in a sputtering franchise, not the direct follow-up to a global box-office hit."
Death on the Nile,"Whatever way you spin it, this is the Belgian detective as we’ve never seen him before. And, frankly, as I have no wish to see him again."
Death on the Nile,The performers are poorly served by the material and mostly deliver their perfunctory lines (“What is going on here?” says Brand) as if loaded with temazepam.
Death on the Nile,There’s a bit of jolly matinee fun to be had.
Death on the Nile,"Branagh clearly loves this character, leaning into the famously persnickety mannerisms even as he insistently locates an emotional core beneath the immaculate white suit and whiskers."
Death on the Nile,There is no sense of crescendo and climax.
Death on the Nile,"The action happens on a steam ship rather than a train this time, though still finds itself veering off the rails as it drags out the setup and rushes the reveals."
Death on the Nile,"It’s no great hardship to watch “Death on the Nile”; it looks pretty, feels pleasantly old-school and is over within shouting distance of the two-hour mark."
Death on the Nile,"It’s a moderately diverting dessert that carries you right along. It never transcends the feeling that you’re seeing a relic injected with life serum, but that, in a way, is part of its minor-league charm."
Death on the Nile,"While its still a cast full of big names, its not as dazzlingly A-list as the first film. When star-wattage is a big part of the sell, that matters."
Death on the Nile,"Kenneth Branagh improves on Murder on the Orient Express, delivering a Death on the Nile adaptation that's far more successful at encouraging viewers to play along as the murder mystery unfolds."
Death on the Nile,"Once things get moving, its smooth sailing to the double-shocker of a denouement."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Downton Abbey brings out the snob in everyone, but it also confounds the snob in everyone: just when you think you’re above it all... someone will show someone else an unexpected kindness, and you’re a puddle again."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,Downton Abbey: A New Era is cinematic escapism at its finest and perhaps that’s all it should be.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"The second film continuation of the Brit series knows it’s old-hat and out of touch. But it’s also comforting fan service and if you can shut out the real world in favor of a fantasy remembrance of things past, you’re in for a treat."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"While not showing any interest in deviating from proven formula, A New Era does exactly what you hope it would do, and gives series fans a little more time with beloved characters, even daring to alter the status quo in one or two major ways."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,There is no gas in the tank; there is no water in the well.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"The trials and tribulations of passive income earners, where every other scene seems to be a discussion over tea and crumpets on who is inheriting what, is almost delightfully absurd this time around."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"The new “Downton Abbey” movie eventually won me over, but I went kicking and screaming."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Elegant, occasionally adorable and at times quite emotional, series creator Julian Fellowes still knows how to pluck the right strings -- upstairs and downstairs -- to play a symphony with his sprawling cast."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"""A New Era"" is both more focused and more substantial than the first film, which makes it especially satisfying to step back into its cozily rose-colored, slightly ridiculous take on early 20th century England."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,This film represents an excellent job of fan service on several levels.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"A New Era offers the kind of comfortable, comforting experience that Downton Abbey aficionados have been awaiting..."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,I’m as shocked as anyone by just how much I adored Downtown Abbey: A New Era.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"“A New Era” is a misnomer of a title -- not much has changed, which actually may be the best gift to “Downton” fans. After a tough couple of years, you could do worse than this."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"If you’re hoping for happy endings for almost every character and a nod to the themes of changing times (like the jazz number and the movie production) and eroding class distinctions, then you will be as delighted as I was."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"What was once a sophisticated, edgy, witty, sexy drama series has become “The Love Boat” Season 10. Though these wax figures’ love is even less exciting and neeeeew than that old show."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,Downton Abbey: A New Era was as satisfying a filmgoing experience as I can remember.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"One may rightfully ask whether the world needs another Downton Abbey movie, to which I would respond in my best Violet Crawley “What is a weekend?” voice: “What is need?”"
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Will you enjoy a A New Era even if you’ve never seen a single second of Downton Abbey? As the Crawleys themselves might say, “I’d rather think so.” But this is a movie for the fans."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"The choppy waters of modernity are materializing on the horizon. To stay afloat, this amiable sequel decides to ever so slightly democratize itself."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Die-hard Downton fans aren’t going to grumble at the chance to spend more time with well-loved characters, and there are plenty of bright spots along the way."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"In the end, ""A New Era"" is a lot like each of the six seasons of ""Downton Abbey"" on PBS: Things start out shakily but end on a lovely, graceful note."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Affords its share of passing pleasures. And not just of the usual luxury-porn variety, although those who watch “Downton Abbey” for the pearls, frocks and waistcoats, the posh furnishings and elegant dinners will hardly be disappointed."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"The film’s sentimental plot may be thinner than a sheet of tissue paper, but it was still moving to this stalwart viewer."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"There is catharsis to be had for long-time “Downton” devotees — and, really, if you aren’t already invested why would you see this movie?"
Downton Abbey: A New Era,The hit British series returns to the big screen with another elegantly entertaining episode.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,All sequels should be so — there’s no other word for it — considerate of their audience.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"As a standalone film, the fatigued period drama goes in one era and out the other with little to add."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,Downton Abbey: A New Era goes down as easy as a Nice sunset.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"It’s a cozy comfort to return to this airy, nearly consequence-free world. As we arrive at A New Era, the story has already had so many endings that all of the characters seem to be reeling in a kind of loopy afterlife."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"There are some amusing one-liners throughout the film, visually it’s beautiful and it mostly has a happy ending."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"A chaste, mannered soap opera that feels like a relic of another time in more ways than one, but perhaps, that’s the entire appeal."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"A charming and soapy new chapter filled with enjoyably dry humor (mostly courtesy of the fantastic Maggie Smith), some heartbreak, a dash of mystery and a history lesson from old-school Hollywood."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Whereas the previous film is nothing more than a superfluous comedy of manners brought about by a royal visit to the estate, the sequel finds Fellowes revisiting some of his series’ most enduring tropes."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Just what the doctor ordered, bringing with it a warm sense of kindness and optimism."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"""A New Era"" isn't going to win over any new converts, but it will give existing obsessives of the series that feeling of warmth that the show gave them over its six-season run."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"‘A New Era’ gives each of these characters their due, remaining true to what fans love with its signature charm and comfort while still managing to surprise."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"As usual, the production design and costumes are museum-perfect, and even as things remain as complicated ever with the Crawleys et al., the film itself is the definition of a simple pleasure."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"The acting is splendid. Fellowes’ dialogue may not be subtle, but the actors are so familiar and at home in these roles that they make up for whatever is lacking."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,A New Era’s acknowledgement that some things must die for new things to be born works to justify the film’s title by quietly linking its themes of entitlement and survival.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"The great allure of the Downton sequel is, once again, Maggie Smith... When, watching the film-within-the-film being made, she says “I’d rather earn my living down a mine”, you can only believe her. Such a star."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,“All smile!” a photographer orders a group early in the film. You can hear the writer in that as well.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"The title of the second Downton Abbey movie promises a new era, but in fact this is a reheated serving of reassuringly familiar comfort food for fans of the series."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"This is filmmaking by numbers, but you can’t really complain. It’s arranged around the need to give all the main cast members their moment in the sun, whether it’s shining on the Mediterranean or the lush lawns and fields of Downton."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,It is afflicted by a ton of exposition and some truly terrible lines. And it’s as highly predictable as it is highly familiar.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Soapy it may be, but for those who’ve poshed it up with the Crawleys since the very start, this is an affectionate, escapist hug of a movie — like being wrapped in a doily."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,Claustrophobic Marks-and-Spencer’s mildness quickly decomposes in memory.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Its an unlikely but pleasant fantasy where good things just happen, the rich are benevolent and the poor all muddle along nicely."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Downton Abbey: A New Era delivers exactly the same as every other incarnation of Downton Abbey, with a tearjerker ending for the core fanbase."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"When Fellowes slips in a reference to David Copperfield, it’s hard not to cringe. Dickens, Shakespeare, Wilde and Christie. Fellowes loves these writers, but -- unlike them -- his success doesn’t seem built to last."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"A New Era is strictly high-toned formula, from its God's-eye opening over spire-tipped turrets and green-velvet lawns to its soft-focus finish, but it feels like home."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Is there still life in these bones, basically? The answer is yes, with caveats, many of them on display in Simon Curtis’ fluffy, frothy, occasionally quite moving, and often scattered-feeling followup, Downton Abbey: A New Era."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"More poignant moments tug at the heartstrings effectively, and are swiftly followed by smiles: This is a film designed to cheer people up."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,The humour never evolves far beyond chortling about the French or treating the working class as a quaint sideshow attraction.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,Often the film feels like a parody of itself...but it works
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Everyone, upstairs and downstairs, is merrily bourgeois together content to hug and kiss as if parlourmaids cleaned the dishes as a favour without any money changing hands."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,There is something diverting about the deadly serious melodrama and bizarre glassy-eyed pathos that Downton 2 is serving up.
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Fellowes gives us an affectionate group hug, which is effectively what these encore visits amount to."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Gosford Park it isn’t – but nor is it just TV writ large. Unlike the previous Downton film, this one feels cinematically worthwhile."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Despite the promise of sweeping change in its title, Downton Abbey: A New Era is very much more of the same, which will be just fine with devotees of the long-running PBS hit."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Now it touches on Disney-ish fantasy, where the drama isn’t even remotely dramatic."
Downton Abbey: A New Era,"Written once again by Julian Fellowes, the film opens with a wedding and goes on to feature a death, a birth and a proposal (not in that order), and yet it leaves the impression that nothing whatsoever has happened."
Firebird,"Even though this beautifully shot and generally well-acted British-Estonian co-production is based on a memoir, it feels too PBS polite, as if the edges have been rubbed away from the real story to appeal to as wide an audience as possible"
Firebird,"Prior and Zagorodnii are both so watchable, and their chemistry so electric, that it’s easy to get swept away in their romance. Historical accuracy be damned."
Firebird,A swooningly romantic love story.
Firebird,"With every ache measured and spelled out, the film’s dogged striving for poetry too often leaves it feeling disappointingly prosaic."
Firebird,"It’s a deeply felt tale made more so by the inherently dicey, if not impossible, nature of Sergey and Roman’s love."
Firebird,"The dominant creative force is cinematographer Mait Mäekivi, who gives the blues and reds of the uniforms and the flags on display an early-Technicolor sort of gleam."
Firebird,It lacks spontaneity in its moment-to-moment execution. Each line and image feels predetermined...
Firebird,"A tragic true story underpins director Peeter Rebane's earnest queer melodrama, but hoary symbolism and hokey scripting work against its authenticity."
Firebird,This ostensibly heart-rending tale of forbidden love hardens into something generic and prefabricated.
Firebird,"There are clichés and then there are only clichés, and Firebird is suffocated by them."
Firebird,"The film’s exploration of love, courage and the price of speaking your truth is as timely as it’s ever been, and for Russians particularly."
Firebird,"The chemistry between the two leads is off the charts in what comes off as a passionate, old-school melodrama that recalls the sweep and the emotional swell of a David Lean epic."
Inland Empire,"Quickly devolves into self-parody. Dern gives a virtuoso performance, albeit in an overwrought, numbing void."
Inland Empire,
Inland Empire,Inland Empire opens and contracts in your imagination while you watch it -- and you're still watching it well after it's left the screen. It's a long but thoroughly absorbing three hours.
Inland Empire,An amazing and unshakeable experience.
Inland Empire,"A bucket of Lynchian leftovers, stirred slightly and left to ferment in the dark."
Inland Empire,"You may find Lynch's experimentalism and willful obscurity to be the work of a poseur, ultimately pointless drivel. I can understand that, but I think you would be wrong."
Inland Empire,A can't-miss experience and likely one of the year's very best films.
Inland Empire,"The great eroto-surrealist David Lynch has gone truffling for another imaginary orifice of pleasure, with results that are fascinating, sometimes very unwholesome, and always enjoyable."
Inland Empire,"Whether shattering or boring, you'll still have your eyes wide, wide open from begin to end."
Inland Empire,"A dazzling and exquisitely original riddle as told by an enigma, featuring a superb, multi-layered performance by Laura Dern."
Inland Empire,The man's still a genius; he just needs to be more ruthless in the editing suite.
Inland Empire,"A free-fall plunge through David Lynch's imagination, a curious and often astonishing place. The film is dazzling and bewildering in equal measure."
Inland Empire,"With Inland Empire, the whole thing feels stuck in Lynch's noggin."
Inland Empire,"Undeniably, Inland Empire has moments that seem like transmissions from cinema's future."
Inland Empire,"Inland Empire is full of good and bad girls, but [Lynch] gives this obsession an interesting spin by having most of them played by the same actress."
Inland Empire,"While you suspect Lynch's digital video acumen will flower into something extraordinary in coming projects, this one's intermittently extraordinary at best."
Inland Empire,"Inland Empire is essentially a journey inside David Lynch's mind, sometimes burrowing very deep indeed. Nobody else could have made this film; nobody else should try."
Inland Empire,It's a bit like watching the final 40 minutes of Mulholland stretched to three hours and filmed with digital-video cameras available at a Circuit City near you.
Inland Empire,"It's worth watching as yet another example of Lynch's extraordinary collaboration with Dern. It may be overstating things to call her performance heroic, but it's nothing if not brave, as she dares to embody Lynch's most brutal impressions of Hollywood."
Inland Empire,"The effect, after an hour or two, begins to resemble a very anxiety-fraught session of watching music videos on MTV."
Inland Empire,"...The film, which begins promisingly, disappears down so many rabbit holes (one of them involving actual rabbits) that eventually it just disappears for good."
Inland Empire,"The way to watch it is to skip uneasily along its surface and steel yourself for those moments when Lynch pulls you into the vortex. More than any working filmmaker, he knows the dreamlike power of undertow."
Inland Empire,"Inland Empire might be David Lynch's masterpiece -- or it might just be a total mess. Either way it's vintage Lynch and designed exclusively, it seems, for hardcore fans -- or perhaps solely for the director himself."
Inland Empire,"Not only is the storytelling murky, so is the picture quality. Video technology may have enabled the director to experiment with long takes and extreme close-ups, but it also yields a movie that's dull on several levels."
Inland Empire,"What is Inland Empire -- which Lynch is understandably distributing himself -- about? What is it trying to say? If you figure that out, let me know."
Inland Empire,"The film is a detailed analysis of Nikki's creative process, of her struggle towards that transcendent point where her art... only connects."
Inland Empire,I can't totally recommend Inland Empire. But something tells me I'd be a fool to totally dismiss it.
Inland Empire,"David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film is as cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse."
Inland Empire,"It's an experience. Either you give yourself over to it or you don't. And if you do, don't miss the end credits."
Inland Empire,"Lynch serves up enough irrationally disturbing images for 100 classic Asian horror films, and the bedraggled Dern is so overflowingly open that you can't dismiss the movie as an arty exercise."
Inland Empire,A great big puzzle movie that even Lynch appears not to have figured out.
Inland Empire,Inland Empire is so locked up in David Lynch's brain that it never burrows its way into ours.
Inland Empire,"My advice, in the face of such hallucinatory brilliance, is that you hang on."
Inland Empire,An interminable bore.
Inland Empire,"Inland Empire may mesmerize those for whom the helmer can do no wrong, but the unconvinced and the occasional admirer will find it dull as dishwater and equally murky."
Inland Empire,Lynch's epic about the movie biz and identity seems less a depiction of the dark recesses of the human mind than an actual product of it.
Inland Empire,"Despite its moments of inspired terror and mystery, this isn't a cult hit in the making like Mulholland Drive, or a contrarian critic's delight like Lost Highway. It's an opaque and baffling work, difficult to follow and difficult to like."
Inland Empire,"The Atlas Shrugged of narrative avant-garde films, compulsively watchable and insanely self-devouring."
Carnal Knowledge,"Nichols has broken thoroughly now with his stage beginnings, integrating camera and action easily, using space and silence with the fluency of a man at home behind a lens."
Carnal Knowledge,A rather superficial and limited probe of American male sexual hypocrisies.
Carnal Knowledge,"The picture has its moments of chilling insight, though essentially it is one more quaint early-70s stab at an American art cinema that never materialized."
Carnal Knowledge,This was never quite the major assault on sexism and male chauvinism it set itself up to be.
Carnal Knowledge,"Stays within the universe of its characters, and inhabits it totally. And within that universe, men and woman fail to find sexual and personal happiness because they can't break through their patterns of treating each other as objects."
Carnal Knowledge,"In addition to being the toughest comedy since Little Murders, and the most imaginative comedy since Catch 22, Carnal Knowledge represents a nearly ideal collaboration of directorial and writing talents."
Carnal Knowledge,
Benediction,"There is no happy-go-lucky ending here, only the sense that an ineffable longing we have, to know and be known, is so precious and rare that most of us never find its fulfillment here on Earth."
Benediction,"Davies is a remarkably empathetic filmmaker, attuned to his characters’ subtlest moods and intent on equally depicting their joys, hardships, and mundane middle grounds."
Benediction,"Davies’s careful craftsmanship and keen sense of melancholy (as opposed to melodrama) keeps the film subtle, but not benign; its portrait of the artist as a broken man gets under your skin."
Benediction,The recountal is tinged with documentary footage and nigh-experimental scintilla attempting to visualize the stuff of poetry that hint at this being something exceptional from a master's intellect.
Benediction,Vividly moving.
Benediction,"Benediction isn’t bad; even a lesser film by this man is better than most, but it is very much a curate’s egg."
Benediction,"Beautifully designed and photographed, sensitively written and directed by England’s acclaimed Terence Davies, and impeccably acted by a distinguished cast that turns life into art, Benediction is one gorgeous motion picture."
Benediction,"I admired the film more than I liked it, but it does have a sort of cumulative power and floating melancholy that does stay with you ."
Benediction,"Alexandre Desplat's score is rapturous, it's just insane. It's Terence Davies, and he's on point completely in this film."
Benediction,To call Benediction a biopic would be giving biopics a bit too much credit. They don’t deserve Benediction.
Benediction,"This is one of Davies’ best films, as equally detached as his earlier work yet brimming with emotions that are a little closer to the surface than we expect from him."
Benediction,"Mr. Davies’s wit is admirable, but his structure is nonexistent. He devises no problem to be solved, no goal to be met, no riddle to be answered."
Benediction,"With every scene a stanza, “Benediction” is a lyrical triumph."
Benediction,"Davies’ masterly portrait of the man and his work is both a loving tribute to him, and a commanding statement against the senselessness of war, a sentiment that could not be more timely."
Benediction,A movie of acute sadness and intense pleasure.
Benediction,Benediction is both expressionistic and vivid in recounting selected particulars of an outwardly fascinating life.
Benediction,"Davies is always fully alive to Sassoon’s pain and disappointment, his artistic genius, and the acute sense of not belonging in a country he understood so uniquely."
Benediction,The sections don’t cohere.
Benediction,The movie is a tour de force for [Jack Lowden and Terence Davies].
Benediction,"We’ve thought about the war, heard it rendered in poetry and caught glimpses of its brutality. And then, through the filter of Sassoon’s tormented memory, we feel it."
Benediction,"A brittle, full-bodied portrait of a troubled artist, decorated soldier and struggling gay man."
Benediction,"Davies’ handling of the material is so exquisite that the overbearing melancholy becomes, in the end, a work of poetry."
Benediction,Turns Sassoon’s story into a virtual opera.
Benediction,"Quibbles aside, “Benediction” is a major work by a gifted and original filmmaker."
Benediction,"Davies tells Sassoon’s story with his typical formalistic and sensual style, elevating what could easily have been an ornate period piece about lingering trauma and living passionately as a closeted gay man."
Benediction,"The dialogue is quietly scathing, and the production values are sumptuous."
Benediction,"In Sassoon’s story, Davies finds a narrative that cuts right to the heart of several of his personal preoccupations."
Benediction,"It’s one man’s breathless search, careening back and forth through the chapters of his life in search of something concrete and true. It’s beautiful, but only in the way it tends to its tragedies with such care."
Benediction,"If you love Davies, you’ll know what to expect and be transported by scenes that hint at deep feelings, as opposed to nailing them down."
Benediction,"The overall tone is melancholic, as dictated by Lowden’s terrific performance as a man searching for something he will never find because he doesn’t know what it is. But it is also wonderfully funny in places."
Benediction,"Benediction, once again so beautifully filmed, so restrained and tactful in its visual world, is nothing less than a perfected statement of a life unredeemed."
Benediction,"Benediction finds both sorrow and hilariously withering wit in the eventful life of a famed wartime poet, offering some of the sharpest, nimblest dialogue of writer-director Terence Davies’ estimable career."
Benediction,Terence Davies perfectly balances heavy themes with the champagne fizz of a London society that just wants to forget everything.
Benediction,"The sheer depth of Sassoon's personal misery feels like a brutally unfashionable thing for a contemporary film to confront, but Davies, who's never given a fig about fashion, confronts it head on."
Benediction,Sassoon's identity struggle makes for an intriguing journey of self-discovery even if his final revelations are cynical. A sad but telling and expertly composed biofilm.
Benediction,"Over its roomy, expansive running time, ""Benediction"" rather devastatingly shows how we become strangers to ourselves as the years march by."
Benediction,"This is Davies' second portrait of a sequestered poet, following 2016's A Quiet Passion, and his third film set against the backdrop of war, after 2011's The Deep Blue Sea and 2015's Sunset Song. It might be the saddest and most tragic of the lot."
Benediction,Terence Davies's film is a rhapsodic portrayal of an upper-crust milieu in which words are wielded like weapons by people who might otherwise be pariahs.
Benediction,"The dialogue is quietly scathing, and the production values are sumptuous. But Davies seems most interested in Sassoon as a symbol of hemmed-in Englishness."
Benediction,"Benediction is not an easy experience and some of the caustic, brittle dialogue scenes with Sassoon's celebrity acquaintances are grating - yet deliberately so. The sadness is overwhelming."
Benediction,"This biographical drama, grounded in the anguished poetry of its protagonist, is hushed and decorous to a fault. But it does eventually wind its way to a profoundly affecting conclusion."
Benediction,"Lowden's clenched jaw of a performance is more filter than focal point, but the actor sets the tone for a film that spends most of its time in the no man's land between repartee and revenge, lovers and frenemies."
Benediction,"It's an elegant piece of filmmaking, if a little too decorous at times."
The Silent Twins,"Some wonderful visual flourishes and two brilliant central performances by Wright and Lawrence help to illuminate the Gibbons sisters’ headspaces. But without important context, true insight and understanding remains elusive."
The Silent Twins,"It’s hard not to be moved by how smoothly Smoczyńska drifts away from the biopic elements of Andrea Seigel’s screenplay to instead inhabit the rich, internal world the Gibbons occupied."
The Silent Twins,Perhaps it’s entirely appropriate that a film about an impenetrable pair should itself prove somewhat impenetrable.
The Silent Twins,"Though skilfully made and formally structured, the film occasionally takes on the quality of “outsider art” – to use the fashionable phrase for works such as June’s book."
The Silent Twins,"What this singular film captures so well is that the sisters, far from being silent, had plenty to say."
The Silent Twins,Some suitably perturbing stop-frame animation sequences set the tone but it’s mostly the deeply sympathetic turns from Wright and Lawrance that convey the true tragedy of lives that were lived in retreat.
The Silent Twins,"If you’ve ever been curious about the psychic link between twins, this film is for you."
The Silent Twins,"The film wants us to share space with the sisters, rather than diagnose them. The impulse is admirable, but narrows the field of vision. But it also feels right that question marks remain."
The Silent Twins,"Unevenly intriguing, The Silent Twins perhaps works best as a portrait of the outsider artist as someone held captive inside their own all-encompassing gesamtkunstwerk..."
The Silent Twins,"Smoczyńska's idiosyncratic vision distinguishes what otherwise might have been an overly literal telling of their story, and of their own stories."
The Silent Twins,"I like the daring of it -- not just stylistically, but tonally."
The Silent Twins,"For all its stylistic flourishes, The Silent Twins winds up a relatively superficial entry in the genre of mental health biopics."
The Silent Twins,"While there's undeniable creativity in the film's visual and metaphorical aspects, there's a glaring neglect in the power needed for this film to find its own voice."
The Silent Twins,"What we’re being presented with is, in effect, two very different movies, each in fundamental opposition to the other."
The Silent Twins,"Despite this reluctance to engage with some of the harsher realities of their story, “The Silent Twins” is an incredibly unique viewing experience rendered in Smoczynska’s singular cinematic vision."
The Silent Twins,"The events of the plot barely register and the girls still feel like strangers by the movie’s conclusion. Yet Smoczynska and her cast still manage to conjure something somatically beguiling, akin to being put in a trance."
The Silent Twins,"The twins’ baffling but compelling story is one that touches on artistic impulses, racial division, female identity, idiopathic psychology, the inadequacies of our educational and psychiatric institutions, and so much more."
The Silent Twins,"Smocyńska’s knack for visual originality is largely unparalleled, but where “The Silent Twins” falters is in its static script."
The Silent Twins,Agnieszka Smoczyńska’s film is unwilling to really sit with the peculiarity of its protagonists’ unique psyches.
The Silent Twins,A tricky one to pull off as both a revealing character study and as commentary about the ‘70s and ‘80s cultural “norms”... works from beginning to end.
The Silent Twins,"A jarring, eerie and sinister experience."
The Silent Twins,"“The Silent Twins” doesn’t try to explain its protagonists’ affliction, but the movie does express its crushing sadness."
The Silent Twins,"In The Silent Twins, the Gibbons sisters are let down by a script that undercuts the unique circumstances of their lives with familiar and ultimately less compelling storytelling tropes."
The Silent Twins,"Smoczynska, Wright and Lawrence find the humanity and empathy in their story, if not the complex psychological reasons behind their unique lives."
The Silent Twins,"The Gibbons twins’ story is an important one to tell. Smoczynska gets a lot of it right, infusing the sisters’ actual passages, songs, and writings into the script. However, the nuances of their Black experience are barely highlighted..."
The Silent Twins,"[A] curious, careering, unshakeable wallop of a film..."
The Silent Twins,"Smoczynska and Seigel’s interpretation of the material feels off somehow — a little too pleased with its own quirk, and too preoccupied with surface texture and color to help viewers truly understand its troubled protagonists."
The Silent Twins,Only scratches the surface of a grave injustice.
The Silent Twins,"This is an engrossing, well-acted story – disturbing but also tender and sad."
Father Stu,... A Christian movie with a bit more heft than the schmaltzy tales routinely served up for middle America’s churchgoers.
Father Stu,"The star’s wild-card charisma motors the story along, even if events sprawl beyond the control of first-time director Rosalind Ross when tragedy enters."
Father Stu,"“(Wahlberg) feels out of place and, dare I say, a little bit ridiculous in the role… he gives a lot to it, but he doesn’t quite pull it off. The plot (also) feels quite heavy-handed in terms of its message."""
Father Stu,Father Stu is so lifeless that saccharine would’ve been an improvement.
Father Stu,"Well-intentioned but ultimately mishandled, it commits the cardinal sin of indecisiveness, middling out in a purgatory of daddy issues and Sunday service pamphlets."
Father Stu,"Playing out to the histrionic squalling of a country-infused score, this is film-making that aims to smite its audience into submission."
Father Stu,The strength of Father Stu is that Stu himself is fully imagined.
Father Stu,"Mark Wahlberg is convincing and committed as a foul-mouthed Father, but this is ultimately just religious propaganda — preaching exclusively to the converted."
Father Stu,"The movie isn’t awful, just sapping and strained."
Father Stu,If Gibson weren’t part of the package it might be possible to like it more.
Father Stu,"Not so much a movie as a test case for the professional rehabilitation of Mel Gibson, this is a film that asks us to separate the dancer from the dance."
Father Stu,Holy hokum.
Father Stu,"""Father Stu"" fails to make Long's saga resonate, capturing the remarkable elements of his life without locating the transcendence within the biographical details."
Father Stu,"Father Stu’s marketing materials make it seem like a faux movie, a parody. But after being invited to a press screening the other week, I can confirm that Father Stu is indeed a real-deal film – although it probably shouldn’t be."
Father Stu,"Father Stu is competently made and Wahlberg puts in another turn as an entertaining loser with a heart of gold. Narratively though, the inspirational story loses inspiration as the film suffers from front-loading..."
Father Stu,"Father Stu is intended to be inspirational, but viewers may find any sense of elevation elusive."
Father Stu,"Told with sensitivity, earnestness and no small amount of sly, rascally charm, it is first and foremost a sure-handed match of material and a movie star’s strengths."
Father Stu,"Its clumsy, inert storytelling seems less interested in converting nonbelievers than in convincing us of Wahlberg’s piety."
Father Stu,"Ross’ script is never able to pull this out of the depths of trite banality, every line and emotional beat clocked from a mile away and cribbed from every other faith-based drama you’ve ever seen."
Father Stu,"Wahlberg compellingly inhabits his character's struggles, and the screenplay is decently structured even when it sometimes lacks persuasive depth or context."
Father Stu,"It can be entertaining but its rarely truly engaging, and the tell-not-show approach to the screenwriting renders the characters two-dimensional and hollow."
Father Stu,"Instead of reaching a broader audience, Wahlberg and Gibson preach to the choir."
Father Stu,"Rosalind Ross, a writer directing her debut feature, and Wahlberg buck the expectations of the religious-salvation story by mostly keeping it light and barely taking a breath, with an extra nudge from a country-heavy soundtrack."
Father Stu,The film is a Hollywood-approved show of Old Testament judgment that sees all people as sinners and thus deserving of all the punishment they receive.
Father Stu,"""Father Stu"" has an R-rated edge that separates it from the majority of faith-based offerings, but it still has a hard time reaching past the first few pews."
Father Stu,"Faith can only get you so far without structure, and the sincerity of this movie’s pivot from punishment to salvation doesn’t stop it from stalling out in purgatory along the way."
Father Stu,"Wahlberg is simply miscast, out of his depth, and the overly long, poorly edited Father Stu never finds its rhythm. Good at humor, sweet with regret but the film ironically ends up short when it comes to the most important part: handling faith itself."
Father Stu,"Anyone who's sat through enough of those Christian films can easily tell that the basic craftsmanship of Father Stu is on a different level. That doesn't necessarily make this an admirable production, but at least it's a proficient one."
Father Stu,Just because something is based on real life doesn’t mean it can’t be cliched.
Father Stu,"“Father Stu” breaks no new ground in the biopic game, but it’s a solid and worthy tribute to the real-life Father Stu..."
Father Stu,"Beside Gibson, the best thing about “Father Stu” is how it’s consistently sincere without ever descending — ascending? — into piety."
Father Stu,"Despite some R-rated language, the whole enterprise seems bland and perfunctory."
Father Stu,"It’s a surprisingly sincere movie about religious feeling, but it is also, too often, a dramatically undernourished one."
Father Stu,"“Father Stu” is often entertaining, thus avoiding the sin of omission committed by many movies made to proselytize. It’s just too damn likable to judge harshly."
Who We Are Now,"Though similar in plot to the 2006 indie Sherrybaby, this Brooklyn-set drama owes more in tone and style to the searing character studies of John Cassavetes."
Who We Are Now,Every minute of this film is absolutely mesmerizing.
Who We Are Now,"Superbly acted and confidently shot, ""Who We Are Now"" delivers substantial dramatic pleasures while posing pertinent questions."
Who We Are Now,"Once again, [Newton] refuses to pretend that lives in disarray can be magically repaired by good intentions, while simultaneously avoiding the defeatist attitude that insists there's consequently no point in even trying."
Who We Are Now,"While Nicholson's onscreen, it's impossible to pay heed to anything but her. She scorches the film with her barely bottled ferocity and vulnerability."
Who We Are Now,"Richly written and sensitively acted, and if some of the big monologues are a touch theatrical, well, these actors really move the merchandise, so that doesn't much matter."
Who We Are Now,"Who We Are Now just ticks too many cliched boxes, particularly in the dialogue department."
Who We Are Now,"Told with the full texture of real life, Nicholson's second collaboration with ""From Nowhere"" filmmaker Matthew Newton is a close-up character study that explores notions of forgiveness and self-worth with surgical precision."
Who We Are Now,"Newton has made a beautiful little film about sacrifice and redemption, and he earns it one tiny brushstroke at a time."
Who We Are Now,"Newton's storytelling is skittish and a bit too on the nose at times, but his palpable generosity toward his cast is rewarded with committed, passionate turns from the ensemble."
On the Come Up,"In her impressive directorial debut, actor-turned-filmmaker Sanaa Lathan delivers a poised and upbeat adaptation of The Hate U Give author's second book"
On the Come Up,Bravo to Lathan for making On the Come Up shine bright like a diamond.
On the Come Up,"On the Come Up is a thoughtful and generous-spirited entertainment, and a reminder of how hard it can be, when you’re young, to figure out who you really are."
On the Come Up,"Even when Gray doesn’t always sell us on her prowess as a potential star rapper, she never fails to embody a young girl on the brink of womanhood struggling with her emotions and looking for a way to use her voice and to have her say."
On the Come Up,"At best, “On the Come Up” lacks the voice, craft and perspective to reshape its source material; at worst, it is content — even celebratory — of its own undeveloped nature."
On the Come Up,"The predictable narrative arc, the happenstance lighting from scene-to-scene and Lathan’s minimalist take on the material all adds up to something you might watch once and promptly forget about."
On the Come Up,"Jamila C. Gray lends credibility to Brianna Jackson, who happens to be searching for just that. She plays the damn role."
On the Come Up,"Where this all lands might feel expected, but Lathan finds surprises at every turn, mostly in her loving and respectful treatment of Bri, who is here oriented as nothing less than a mythic heroine."
On the Come Up,"""On the Come Up"" has an old-school quality to it regarding the shooting style and aesthetic. John Singleton, and the Hughes Brothers, clearly influenced Lathan’s direction."
On the Come Up,"Sanaa Lathan’s cliched, visually inert directorial debut On the Come Up is both dishonest and manipulative."
On the Come Up,"Lathan, who’s had a long and fruitful career as an actress in TV shows like “The Affair,” does well in her first go as a director."
On the Come Up,"Even when it stacks the clichés, becoming a bit too reliant on the requisite melodramatic beats, the film doesn’t lose its heart."
On the Come Up,"As frank and tough-minded and as it is warm and sweet, “On the Come Up” is a hugely promising debut from the actor-turned-director."
Paul’s Promise,A faith based film about a mother's devotion. Simple story but an effective one.
Mothering Sunday,"The film as a whole succeeds superbly both in its evocation of a sensual, erotic love affair and in its treatment of the bereaved families who, despite their elevated place in society, can never replace all that they’ve lost."
Mothering Sunday,O’Connor is an actor who always seems to be regarding life with a raised eyebrow and the rapport between him and Young turns them into loving co-conspirators meditating on the fluidity of time.
Mothering Sunday,"Mothering Sunday, a heart-wrenching drama directed by Eva Husson and based on the novel by Graham Swift, shows that people are more than what they do. They are also the sum of their traumas."
Mothering Sunday,"There’s a Malickian quality to the film that’s cheesy at moments, and the disjointed chronology is more aggravating than affecting."
Mothering Sunday,"While the movie’s nonlinear construction is its selling point, at least for those moviegoers who prefer a bit of a challenge, an underlying vibe of melancholy gives Mothering Sunday thematic weight."
Mothering Sunday,It proves — yet again — that the best books are probably better left alone.
Mothering Sunday,"A really good, solid film for the people who love Downton Abbey and who maybe want to see it with a bit of a kick."
Mothering Sunday,"Count “Mothering Sunday” as a breakthrough for Young, as well as one for Husson, who deserves the international career that “Mothering Sunday” all but guarantees."
Mothering Sunday,"On an intuitive, sensual level, Mothering Sunday is intoxicating. As a story with plot and characters, its nothing we havent seen before."
Mothering Sunday,"Shimmers with confident filmmaking, fine performances and a belief in the melancholic resonance of a lovers’ sanctuary as something difficult to let go of."
Mothering Sunday,"The picture is a bit arty and decorous; it could do with fewer swimmy camera moves. But Young vests it with a fascinating, flinty grace."
Mothering Sunday,"“Mothering Sunday” never conveys the intensity of erotic passion, the ardor of creative ambition or the agony of grief. Even though it is ostensibly about... those feelings, it handles them with a tastefulness that is hard to distinguish from complacency."
Mothering Sunday,"Something went wrong (or got lost) in the translation of Graham Swift’s novella to the movie adaptation, directed by Eva Husson from a screenplay by Alice Birch."
Mothering Sunday,"For all of the films somberness, its depiction of an era of rigid class divisions and incalculable loss still comes through the hazy, soft-focus goggles of nostalgia."
Mothering Sunday,"Memory is selective, memory is jumbled, memory travels in different directions. And so does Mothering Sunday, Eva Husson’s affecting and visually pleasing -- if languorous -- meditation on love and loss."
Mothering Sunday,"The costumes from Oscar winner Sandy Powell are gorgeous, but can hardly compete with Jane’s Pre-Raphaelite silky skin gorgeously lit by award-winning cinematographer Jamie Ramsay."
Mothering Sunday,This movie isn't especially subtle but it is well-intentioned and involving.
Mothering Sunday,"Birch inventively shuffles the cards of Swift's source in a manner that, at its best, makes the film feel more like an emotional memory than an unfolding narrative."
Mothering Sunday,"While so much of Mothering Sunday focuses on how grief, or the lack of grief, shapes its characters, it comes to an oddly inconclusive end."
Mothering Sunday,"Mothering Sunday just falls short of a great movie; a radical attempt to shake up period-picture staidness, shot through with strong performances, impeccable craft and a strain of sadness, but it's never enough to tug vigorously at the heartstrings."
Mothering Sunday,A thoughtful and deeply affecting meditation on the loneliness of the lifelong writer.
Mothering Sunday,"Great gowns, beautiful gowns..."
Mothering Sunday,"A moving drama that shifts back and forwards in time to paint a portrait of its characters' lives, Mothering Sunday is particularly satisfying when it focuses on Jane, who's beautifully portrayed by rising Aussie star Young."
Mothering Sunday,Well-crafted. Well-told. Fits the genre neatly. Husson shows great promise.
Mothering Sunday,"""Mothering Sunday"" pushes toward cut-and-dried conclusions, sewing up certain storylines with a finality that doesn't befit the early sense that nothing is really ever over for Jane or the wounded world she inhabits."
Mothering Sunday,Audiences will likely be seduced by the combination of Brit star power and the unapologetic steaminess of the central relationship.
Mothering Sunday,"This script, by Lady Macbeth's Alice Birch, does remarkable things to make the story breathe on film."
Mothering Sunday,"The director moves fluidly between the time periods, helped by a transcendent score from Morgan Kibby."
Mothering Sunday,"There is a lot to admire in this film, though I wanted a bolt of lightning to burst through the cloudcover of sadness."
Mothering Sunday,"It's flawed, but this may be one of the sexiest heterosexual period dramas in some time."
Mothering Sunday,"""Mothering Sunday"" is best when it trades in this kind of cruel, poignant precision, as opposed to gauzy interludes of less specific but gorgeously rendered atmosphere."
A Love Song,The landscape has a certain gaunt beauty and so does Dickey’s performance.
A Love Song,"[Walker-Silverman] lets his film play out, as naturally as the performances of his leads, who never seem to be acting. Instead they are exploring, whether it’s their surroundings or each other."
A Love Song,"This is a film of grace and beauty, and deserves to give [Dale] Dickey awards recognition."
A Love Song,"Beautiful, quiet, tender, and borne aloft by that rejection of the idea of hopelessness."
A Love Song,It's a pleasant film to hang out with for a while.
A Love Song,"This is a very gentle, low-key humanistic tale told with a lot of subtlety and grace."
A Love Song,It’s the cinematic equivalent of a deep breath and a cool drink.
A Love Song,"Like life, A Love Song offers no easy conclusions—just simple realizations. In expert hands, that’s enough."
A Love Song,"Like a coy, concise short story you might remember having read years ago, A Love Song is the simplest of tales, but there’s a complex universe of longing contained within it."
A Love Song,"It’s well-photographed, unobtrusively edited, full of wondrous sights, and acted by a couple of masters of warm underplaying."
A Love Song,"“A Love Song” has the narrative economy and the sneaky emotional power of a well-crafted short story, plus a feel for isolation and rootlessness that harks back to some of the great drifter portraits of American independent cinema."
A Love Song,"Make no mistake: A Love Song is, first and foremost, a love letter to Dickey... It’s the sort of performance that makes you stop taking great actors for granted."
A Love Song,"Slow, sweet and subdued, “A Love Song,” Max Walker-Silverman’s lovely first feature, is about late-life longing and needs that never completely go away."
A Love Song,"As a viewer, you may leave the theater with more answers than when you arrived -- and that’s refreshing. Walker-Silverman has no interest in putting pretty bows on things, loads of past histories or sentimentality."
A Love Song,The film relies on wide shots of distant mountains to stand in for a fruitful interrogation of what it means to occupy the open terrain of the U.S.
A Love Song,"This is a quiet, lovely film about the kinds of people rarely afforded such a humanistic portrayal in cinema."
A Love Song,"Max Walker-Silverman writes and directs this small, satisfying drama about what love looks like when you’ve lived your life and are wondering what’s next."
A Love Song,"Both Dickey and Studi deliver deeply spiritual performances, harmonizing their gazes and bodily moves in an achingly restrained dance, against nature's mystical grandeur."
A Love Song,"A steady pace, gently beating hearts and a bevy of amusing co-stars make this film go down as smoothly as one of the yearning country songs on Faye's transistor radio."
A Love Song,"A showcase for two actors who have long been grounding, realistic presences in films that didn't quite give them this kind of platform."
A Love Song,"A quiet movie, very in tune with the outdoors, but one that slowly fills the heart."
A Love Song,Both Dickey and Studi shoulder the lesser material through a charming naturalism that papers over the script's artificiality.
A Love Song,"[A] subdued but affecting drama which showcases both a stark and striking backdrop and a pair of lovely, intimate performances from character actors Dale Dickey and Wes Studi."
A Love Song,"If the film doesn't exactly transcend its familiarity... it succeeds, often with understated magnificence, in finding ways to sidestep it - to make you not mind in the slightest."
A Love Song,"It's uncommon to stumble upon a first-time director with a sensitivity to such feelings, but Walker-Silverman's clearly a romantic."
A Love Song,"Dickey steps into a rare lead role, a showcase of hardwearing grace and the best of her decades-long career on screen. The perceived sternness of her previous roles is substituted in A Love Song by a measured openness to people and to the land."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"A deliciously twisty remix of the classic British-style murder mystery, with a fabulous location and a group of suspects who all have motive and opportunity. Also like its predecessor, it has an all-star cast clearly enjoying themselves enormously."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Glass Onion is a perfect reminder that great art need not be serious. Sometimes, it’s just about having fun. If you look closely, even the Mona Lisa is smiling just a little."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Blanc is bland, and despite all its bells and whistles, so is the movie."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"The twisty plot isn't quite as ingenious as Johnson's last one, but the writer-director has gone all-out to make everything in Glass Onion as big, broad, funny and colourful as Daniel Craig's southern drawl."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Glass Onion is saturated with enchanting moments and quick-witted dialogue, along with Janelle Monáe’s wonderful performance as Bron’s estranged best friend..."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Johnson certainly delights in creating puzzling distractions, but even if his film is as deep as a layer of onion skin, it is immensely engaging. ""Glass Onion"" gently mocks its characters, which what makes it so enjoyable"
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Everyone in Rian Johnson’s Glass Onion, the sequel to his unexpectedly delightful 2019 murder mystery Knives Out, seems to be having a blast -- especially the highly accomplished director."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,Glass Onion is not a perfect film... but it makes for a really good time.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Craig, shed of his dour James Bond stiffness, is enough to carry ""Glass Onion"" over its rough patches, while Norton and Monáe dine on the meal Johnson puts in front of them."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"A bright and bubbly whodunit, perfect for holiday-season escapism."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Rian Johnson has pulled off the impossible. He’s followed up his wildly successful Knives Out with a second instalment that is just as fun, just as clever and just as brilliant as the first."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,It makes for a profoundly empty viewing experience.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It's so glossy, over-produced, and swank... I didn't find the cast all that sterling."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,We should have several movies a month like this. I'm glad Rian Johnson is the person who keeps making them.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Glass Onion wisely avoids trying to top its predecessor’s sentimentality. Rather, the film pushes deeper into playfulness, while still maintaining a poignant streak."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"The actors evidently consider this type of movie to be a frolic, and their sense of fun is contagious."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Knives Out may have bottled a cultural moment, but Glass Onion seems built for longevity: it’s populist entertainment with its head screwed on right. And there’s plenty of value in that."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Johnson is clearly more tickled by the Who than the Dunnit. Once it arrives, the actual murder case is treated like a chore."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Looser, flabbier but fun."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,Glass Onion is a late year present from a director who rarely disappoints.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Glass Onion is a marvel to watch, at once gleeful and diverting while not lacking thematic resonance. It elicits a sense of wonder as Johnson pulls off a feat of engineering, creating pure pleasure with a finale that delivers satisfaction..."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It’s whip-smart, joyful, and more than a little bit mischievous, yet another manipulation/reinvention of the classic whodunit, made with a cast whose thrill to be working produces an experience that’s as exuberant for them as it is for viewers."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Blanc feels one draft, one rewrite away from a truly distinctive creation. Easier said than done; meantime, Craig’s filling in the blancs very nicely indeed."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"As he did in “Knives Out,” Johnson craftily weaves in a strong plot thread of the haves versus the have-nots. That inclusion feels less clunky this time; the outcome is equally enjoyable in its schadenfreude."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"When pop cinema is powered by ruthless intelligence, it’s good for everyone."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"While different in tone and structure from the previous film, this one is even more rapturously entertaining than its predecessor. It is also quite a bit funnier."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,[An] uproarious if slightly inferior sequel.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Johnson, who once again also penned the script, has no shortage of ammunition for his rat-a-tat takes on pop-culture ephemera and the navel-gazing delusions of wealth and fame."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,There’s a good deal of fun in Glass Onion... [But] the movie has a slight case of the diminishing-return blues.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Writer-director Rian Johnson again assembles a solid cast behind Daniel Craig, but it’s his use of language -- where nary a word is wasted -- that finally gives the sequel its edge."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"The joy of Glass Onion is that you can read into it, or just let it flow over you and enjoy the ride."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It’s bigger, wilder and funnier than its predecessor."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Glass Onion still has the edge over the year’s other whodunnits, if only because of the sublime Monáe."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It’s a bigger, showier follow-up, from the A-list cast to the twistier twists, even if it doesn’t have the same witty punch as the original."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"The first one was good … this one is better: an ingenious, headspinningly preposterous and enjoyable new whodunnit romp featuring Daniel Craig as the legendary detective from the deep south, Benoit Blanc."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"This is a whip-smart, consistently funny and sure to be crowd-pleasing affair."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Let’s give thanks for this wicked, whacked-out whodunit sequel.. Daniel Craig is back as southern-fried detective Benoit Blanc and all is right with this crazy world as a cast of merry pranksters (yay Janelle Monae) turns murder most foul into comic gold."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"For all that self-aware fuss, Glass Onion works darn well as a mystery romp. It is a little smooth to the touch, but there are beautiful chicanes along the route to a satisfactorily clamorous conclusion."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Leave it to screenwriter/director Rian Johnson to give us the perfect holiday after-dinner aperitif, a sparkler worth imbibing more than once with family and friends."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,The enormously appealing thing about “Glass Onion” is watching the cast have an obviously good time with their characters and with each other.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"One of the purest pop pleasures of the season, the kind of irresistible crowd-pleaser that balances its franchise obligations with a clear sense of wit and creative purpose."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Whether they see it on a big screen or small, viewers will no doubt instantly recognize the new batch of characters invented by writer-director Rian Johnson, whose timing and satirical targets have once again proved utterly uncanny."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"A fizzy, gaudy, joyfully entertaining couple of hours. If there’s any right in the world, Rian Johnson and Daniel Craig will continue making films in the Benoit Blanc Cinematic Universe forever."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"A breezy caper that mostly sustains its novelty, even if it stumbles a bit in the last third."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"I can’t say much about what happens in “Glass Onion” without giving away some surprises, but I can say that some of the pleasure comes from being wrong about what will happen next."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,Daniel Craig is just through-the-roof entertaining as Blanc; his Foghorn Leghorn accent is even more welcome the second time around.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"You watch “Glass Onion” relaxed, feeling like you’re in good hands; everyone on-screen is clearly having a wonderful time, so you can’t help but join right in."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"As entertaining as the first Benoit Blanc mystery was, I think this one is slightly better."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,Johnson’s twist-packed script and sight-gag-packed frame offer something few contemporary blockbusters do: attunement to the audience’s emotional response in the moment.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"The bottom line is that Johnson has established a tone, a style and a lead character that should serve him well for years."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"The real star? Johnson’s crisply mischievous screenplay, which crams in so many laughs you almost don’t notice the occasional plot holes."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,The only gripe one could have against it would be Johnson’s decision to move the film from classic whodunnit to something altogether sillier and more out there.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It is shiny with mischief, crafted with guile, and performed with eager wit... Why, then, should the whole enterprise feel so curiously thin and cold to the touch?"
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,Glass Onion is so cleverly and distressingly prescient. Some of its timeliness is serendipity; the larger share is a smart writer and director who understands that the roots of these sad farces are as old as our country.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Johnson sits midway between Wes Anderson and Christopher Nolan, while being much breezier and more likeable than either. Glass Onion is as irresistibly entertaining as all his work, though not lacking in layers of ambiguity if you look for them."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"An electric standalone sequel by writer/director Rian Johnson with nearly all of the same bugs and features of his predecessor, albeit with new flavoring."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"This smart, sassy murder-mystery establishes Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc as a Poirot for the super-rich era."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It’s bold and pays off; even if you think you know who’s behind it all, the crafty way information is doled out ensures you would never know how or why."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"A serious case of sequelitis — it’s bigger, louder, emptier."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Like its precursor, Glass Onion doubles as a dazzlingly engineered gizmo and a raucous cautionary satire, with implications that billow out into the world even as its mechanisms snap satisfyingly shut."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"If you like your gaudy whodunits stirred but not shaken, this might be for you."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"The appeal of Craig’s magnanimously verbose super-sleuth is real, as is Johnson’s ability to craft—and execute—a multilayered suspense plot whose solution is, as per the Beatles-derived structure of the title, visible in plain sight."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Another masterful murder mystery from Rian Johnson. Just like the first film, Glass Onion will warrant multiple viewings to fully soak in the wild amount of precision and passion that went into the film."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Johnson has presented a puzzle box sequel, Glass Onion, that's phenomenal, fun, gorgeous, and absolutely thrilling."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"As a film about the intricate joys of puzzle-solving, it’s plain to see Johnson getting his kicks in the same way, reveling in complexity and bringing us with him as he untangles it."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Rian Johnson’s follow-up to 2019’s Knives Out is a wholly superior whodunit contraption, at once more complex, cunning, and laugh-out-loud amusing."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,The first Knives Out remains a delight that repays return visits; Glass Onion is a very funny one-and-done.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It might be foolhardy to claim that Johnson has produced a socially conscious murder mystery, and yet there’s a sobering motif within the plot: namely, the moral compromises that proximity to great wealth tempts people with."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"The climax has a certain primally cathartic power, but it doesn’t quite dispel the air of self-satisfaction that envelops the script."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"... A one-location whodunnit that feels less Agatha Christie and more The Long Goodbye. At least, this is how it feels when its comedy is working, its twists are twisting, and its satire is the good kind of heavy-handed."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It will probably take no time at all for spoilers to start arriving online, but Johnson is ahead of that too. Glass Onion will be just as much fun to watch a second time, knowing even more than Blanc does."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Fear not: Glass Onion is a zippy ride just like Knives Out. I just hope that in his third outing, Detective Blanc finds himself in a humble old regular-sized mansion. That’s where he works best."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,The more expansive story makes this sequel feel less tightly wound or exhilarating than its predecessor. But it goes harder on bringing the entertainment and maintaining the magic of Benoit Blanc’s sleuthing expertise.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"A lot has happened since 2019, and “Glass Onion” acknowledges the Covid-19 pandemic in its opening sequences. But it hasn’t anticipated genre-shifting game-changers like “Bodies Bodies Bodies” and “Triangle of Sadness” now driving the conversation."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Glass Onion is bigger and more precisely designed than Knives Out, but what makes it a more satisfying movie is that it sits with its characters more rather than immediately showing off their decay."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,Murder. Mayhem. Mediocrity.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"Subtly echoes and departs from its predecessor, maintaining the usual high quality standards without lapsing too blithely into formula."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,How do you give audiences more of what they liked while still surprising them? Glass Onion is the answer.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,It's all just so much fun. There’s a contagious aspect to the ensemble in that one can easily tell that they just had a blast making this movie on a Greek isle with dialogue as incredibly smart as Johnson's.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"An immensely enjoyable movie which is at least as funny as the first outing, if not more."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"This picture offers more action, more delicious comeuppances, more daring design and a few genuinely surprising cameos just for good measure."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"It’s hard not to have fun when Johnson pulls the strings, I just wish he’d not pulled quite so many and quite so hard."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"“Glass Out” expands into something even more extravagant than the first “Knives Out,” which is what you want, even if at moments it can feel like a little more than you want."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,If you loved Benoit Blanc in “Knives Out”... seeing him tossed into the deep end of yet another wacky-rich whodunit will only further bewitch you.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out M…,"In “Glass Onion,” the filmmaker shows absolute mastery of his genre and his craft. It’s pure pop pleasure."
Montana Story,Introduces an element of finality to the American West...part of a new wave of films that herald the death of the Western.
Montana Story,An intimate story of tragedy and reconnection that is no less riveting than the terrain where it transpires.
Montana Story,"This is a reflective, sensitive feature in which the stunning cinematography of stark Montana landscapes compliment the mood and further the accomplishments of the thoughtful performances and story."
Montana Story,The film constitutes a breakthrough for Teague and confirms the promise that Richardson showed in “Five Feet Apart” and “Edge of Seventeen” — a powerhouse in the making.
Montana Story,"A very heavy family drama. Ultimately it is very uplifting, which is what I like most about it."
Montana Story,"Richardson and Teague, meanwhile, are magnetic...Their story is personal, yes. But their performances make it universal, and make “Montana Story” a story worth telling."
Montana Story,"The expansive widescreen images of Montana landscapes and the impeccable lead and supporting performances carry the picture, and it's generally a pleasure to see a film done in this mode at a time when so few filmmakers dare attempt it."
Montana Story,"The interactions between the people may seem small in comparison to the wide-open landscapes and rolling hills. In the hands of everyone involved with this moving drama, however, they echo long and loudly nonetheless."
Montana Story,"The flawed young characters grow on you, their troubles gradually becoming as mythic as the landscape that surrounds them."
Montana Story,"Montana Story, for all its beauty, grows tiresome because it has nowhere to drive other than toward reconciliation."
Montana Story,"The script is a touch too novelistic and the ending rather predictable, but pitch-perfect performances keep this melodrama from slipping too far into mawkishness."
Montana Story,"While the events that transpire are minimal, the poignancy of “Montana Story” resides in watching these two strangers, once inseparable, reconnect now as different people but with the same scars."
Montana Story,"There’s much to like in “Montana Story,” including Teague and Richardson, who, whether together or alone, retain an emotional integrity."
Montana Story,Teague and Richardson establish a compelling interplay; their bond is like a tossed-away blossom that uncrumples and comes back to life.
Montana Story,Movies about childhood trauma rarely come as powerfully understated as Montana Story.
Montana Story,"The film is initially distinguished by its poetic understatement, only for it to eventually succumb to staleness."
Montana Story,"This is a minor-key modern Western whose melancholy probe into the bruising past gives way, in a quietly satisfying conclusion, to the hope of reconciliation, even healing."
Montana Story,"Two excellent young performers hold enough of it together, but a languid pace that feels almost designed to mimic the speed of life in Big Sky Country goes too far."
Montana Story,"While the occasional exposition-laden monologue rears its ugly head, the directors offset their familial drama with plain-spoken filmmaking that foregrounds the beautiful panoramic vistas of Montana in epic fashion."
Montana Story,"""Montana Story"" doesn't reinvent the Western wheel. Rather it offers tender mercies as a sentimental work that explodes in well-earned fury."
The Forgiven,"The Forgiven takes the harder road, and actually proves more engrossing and haunting in retrospect than when you’re actually watching it. In an era of instant gratification, that, for all the film’s evident flaws, is still worth chin-stroking respect."
The Forgiven,This brutal clash of cultures forms the core of the drama.
The Forgiven,"Comes closer to embodying the tragic futility of two irreconcilable cultures attempting understanding, rather than properly deconstructing it."
The Forgiven,... A gathering of cartoon ciphers who seem to have been created solely to allow McDonagh access to his favourite anti-woke whipping sticks.
The Forgiven,"Beneath the garishly brittle portrait of ghastly westerners lording it up in Morocco, there’s a low-key, brooding quality to this accomplished if somewhat inert screen adaptation of Lawrence Osborne’s 2012 bestseller."
The Forgiven,"The stiffness in the writing and general lack of subtlety leave this feeling underwhelming and overwrought. As a moral fable, The Forgiven offers little genuine critique."
The Forgiven,Ralph Fiennes and Jessica Chastain are brilliantly loathsome but it’s a journey not everyone will want to take...
The Forgiven,"It’s a compelling, tense journey even if it’s a pitiless one. Human nature doesn’t come out of this at all well."
The Forgiven,"McDonagh has crafted a complex tale of crime, punishment and guilt, much in the manner of his earlier work. Here, the morality is as shifting as sand, and just as uncomfortable when it gets inside your clothes."
The Forgiven,"As a portrait of a hell on earth, The Forgiven makes every bit of the globe seem sulphurous."
The Forgiven,"The cast look like they had a great time playing useless snobs, which must be one of the easier acting assignments going, but that’s not to say they all do it equally well."
The Forgiven,Too muted and thinly written for its acerbic bite to really make a mark.
The Forgiven,"The Forgiven is film noir, tough and unrelenting, making no effort to charm. It is superbly acted, particularly by Fiennes, and makes effective use of these extreme landscapes, including their silence."
The Forgiven,"The Forgiven luxuriates in the grey zone, a provocative and incisive film that asks more questions than it provides answers."
The Forgiven,"It’s an odd melange, at times reminiscent of the weaker films of Paolo Sorrentino, the moralistic elements co-existing with gaudy costumes and mannered performances that push the whole enterprise at least halfway towards camp."
The Forgiven,"It's very good... Great performances, and it left me feeling ambivalent about a lot of things."
The Forgiven,"Richly designed and exotically executed, The Forgiven is an unusual film that holds interest even on the rare occasions when it challenges credibility."
The Forgiven,A wonderful film noir that feels like something straight out of the 1940s.
The Forgiven,McDonagh’s film is well-crafted throughout but ultimately has nothing fresh or insightful to say about the ugliness of white privilege.
The Forgiven,"This sharply written, though fuzzily realized, drama launches with a twist reminiscent of Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities."
The Forgiven,"There may have been higher ideals in mind, but “The Forgiven” fails to gracefully reach them."
The Forgiven,"Mostly, though, it allows you to spend time with Fiennes, whose performance says more about this world’s nihilism than all the brittle chatter."
The Forgiven,"Even considering that numerous subplots might benefit from a mini-series approach to the material, the transformation of the central character is handled in a powerful, credible manner."
The Forgiven,"Sneering at slick emptiness becomes itself a kind of slick emptiness, only worse, since it’s self-congratulatory."
The Forgiven,Whatever satire of white elite society is intended by The Forgiven has been blunted by monotony.
The Forgiven,"There have, if we're being honest, been quite enough stories that sacrifice the disadvantaged so that the privileged can learn a little lesson about themselves."
The Forgiven,"A dark and dirty morality play where nobody's very concerned with morals, John Michael McDonagh's ""The Forgiven"" takes some extremely questionable behavior and makes it as intriguing as it is off-putting."
The Forgiven,"McDonagh loves his monsters, and in casting someone as adept at conveying the nuances of the character's transformation as Fiennes, he shows that he understands the core tragedy of ""The Forgiven."""
The Forgiven,"[McDonagh] seems wholly amused by tearing asunder a Dionysian display of the rich and bored, gathered for a debaucherous jamboree in the neocolonized North of Africa."
The Forgiven,"A wrong-footing combination of crime thriller, dark comedy and shaggy hangout movie."
The Forgiven,"Scripted, directed and acted with intelligence and panache, it's a very grown-up film but never a bore, a morally alert drama that leaves the scolding to us."
The Forgiven,"Fiennes and Chastain loathe each other well, convincingly bickering about whatever emerges from the other's mouth while still ensuring enough care to suggest a history."
Selena,"Take away that ending, and you haven't got a movie. Fortunately, Selena also has actress Jennifer Lopez, who is good enough to hold your attention when the movie is not."
Selena,"As conventional mainstream filmed entertainment, then, Selena may not succeed completely. But as a ritual of celebration and closure it will provide its audience with an opportunity for some cathartic memories, laughs and tears."
Selena,"While Olmos is the soul of the film, Jennifer Lopez as Selena is its playful heart. Lip-synching to popular recordings by the singing sensation and bopping to her irrepressible beat, she personifies girlish high hopes."
Selena,"Director Gregory Nava might have done us all a favor by tightening up the script. Still, fans of the music, which mixes traditional Mexican styles with rock music, should enjoy the movie for its many songs and Lopez's convincing portrayal."
Selena,"The result feels like a work produced for the Family Channel, to be followed by a panel discussion about family values and a sales pitch for the new Selena doll."
Selena,"In a performance captivating enough to lend validity to some of the more heavy-handed ""message"" dialogue, Lopez emerges as a talent to watch."
Selena,"Selena is well-made, hummable, too long yet quite watchable. At its center is a plaster saint."
Selena,"If Olmos brings dignity and stature to what could have been a problematic role, Lopez overcomes what must have been a lot of curiosity if not outright skepticism on the part of Selena's fans. They should be satisfied, though."
Selena,"When Lopez is allowed to shine in a few numbers, she generates heat. But the movie flattens out when she is off stage."
Selena,"Even as hagiographies go, Selena misses the inspirational beat."
Selena,"Facing the conflicting pressures of this assignment, Nava achieves an honorable compromise -- a sweet if simple-minded fan letter which, like his previous films... amounts to a warmhearted celebration of the indestructible bonds of family."
Selena,"All in all, it's a serviceable tribute, but hardly a memorable experience for those who don't already remember her."
Selena,"Well-intentioned by clumsy, Selena hints tantalizingly at the more compelling movie it might have been."
Selena,"In capturing the essential appeal of Selena to the millions of Latinos who adored her, Nava has come up with one of the most joyous and effective celebrations of an entertainer's life in memory."
Selena,"Selena's fans should find it respectful and appropriately celebratory, but it doesn't have much originality or insight to offer."
Selena,"Although Gregory Nava's film is full of sentimental moments of family life, it never quite captures the adulation Selena enjoyed, despite scenes of frenzied crowds."
Selena,It tries to satisfy too many different groups at once and ends up watering down the art so much it satisfies no one.
Selena,"Gregory Nava's 1997 biopic about the Mexican-American pop star Selena Quintanilla Perez... is typical of the genre's excesses, but I enjoyed quite a bit of it, in large part because of the energy and charisma of Jennifer Lopez in the title role."
Selena,"What makes this movie work is Jennifer Lopez's electric performance as Selena, capturing the charismatic aspects of Selena's stage persona and the essence of her maturity as a growing woman."
Selena,"The best thing going for Selena is Selena herself, played with verve, heart, and a great deal of grace by the increasingly busy Jennifer Lopez."
Selena,"The result is not a sad film but a happy one, coming across like a big party for her, with lots of smiles and even more music."
Selena,"Lopez's presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom, and with Selena she's seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film's numerous musical numbers."
Selena,"At its best, Selena suggests why so many people reacted with such great heartbreak to her death."
Selena,"Selena surmounts its connect-the-dots approach to its heroine's life to create an appealing, energetic look at a too-briefly soaring musical star."
Selena,"By the end of the film, Selena has been all but canonized."
Selena,"Nava, who started his feature-film career with El Norte, is a good director who invariably finds a strong rapport with his actors. He's not much of a writer, though, and he should think twice about creating dialogue for his future projects."
Selena,Missing is a sense of the interior life behind the smiling face that Selena showed the world. What of the drive that led her to music? What comfort did she find in it? What pain?
Selena,"Selena succeeds, through Lopez's performance, in evoking the magic of a sweet and talented young woman."
Selena,
Selena,"This is a simple story of hope and triumph, of one girl with the drive to succeed defying the odds and following her dream. It's not an original tale -- movies like this abound -- but Nava's point-of-view is fresh."
Selena,Why create a film biography so generic that it serves only to trivialize its subject and posthumously extend the celebrity-packaging process?
Selena,"Selena Quintanilla Perez's life was too short to fill a screen bio with traditional dramatic components, yet Selena infectiously salutes the Tejano singer who had a rapturous fan base when she was slain in 1995."
The Inspection,The Inspection succeeds in the end because this powerful real-life character study is firmly rooted in reality.
The Inspection,"It’s Ellis’s story and [Jeremy Pope] keeps you on his side all the way with a performance so direct, intuitive -- and restrained -- that you feel as if he’s letting you in on his every thought."
The Inspection,"Fiercely candid, in its condemnation of the brutality that is enmeshed in the training programme, and in its celebration of the bonds and brotherhood that grow between fellow cadets."
The Inspection,"The ending is a tad contrived (it gets a bit O Captain! My Captain!), and Gabrielle Union seems slightly one-dimensional as French’s cruel and bigoted mother. But there is much to appreciate here."
The Inspection,"The Inspection may be by the book, but the layers of personal detail and emotionally resonant core lend it an authenticity that hits home and hits hard."
The Inspection,"Some brilliant performances, but mixed messages cloud the overall impression."
The Inspection,Gabrielle Union just blows me away. She's in the film for about 10 minutes... but it's the most amazing 10 minutes of her career.
The Inspection,"""The Inspection"" does feel unfocused at times, or like it's playing the Greatest Hits of other movies that came before it. It's not until Union's character returns that the film comes full circle..."
The Inspection,"Observant, insistent and unsparing, wrapped around characters that feel real and rounded."
The Inspection,"It is the type of film — brave, raw and poetic — that will rightly put Bratton on the map as someone to watch, not to mention the standout performances of Jeremy Pope and Gabrielle Union."
The Inspection,"With The Inspection, Bratton has continued working with the humanist lens through which he shaped his captivating 2019 documentary Pier Kids."
The Inspection,"A stunning look at a gay man’s terrifying, triumphant time at Marines boot camp."
The Inspection,Bratton’s unique perspective is so much more interesting when you hear him talk about “The Inspection” that you often wonder where it is when you’re watching it.
The Inspection,"A powerful, poignant, and complicated look at what people will do for acceptance."
The Inspection,Elegance Bratton’s autobiographical story The Inspection is one of learning to accept love on one’s own terms.
The Inspection,"Jeremy Pope gives a searing performance as the young man lacking direction, with Gabrielle Union a powerful force as the mother who initially disowns him."
The Inspection,"Bratton brings a surreal, rubbed-raw realness to “The Inspection” — reflected in the performances, the film’s gritty look and unconventional style."
The Inspection,"Where most films that recount military training ultimately lead to the battlefield, this one is preparation for a different sort of combat."
The Inspection,"A well-meaning, sometimes moving, but at times exasperating movie."
The Inspection,"Bratton, who has an eye for compelling framing and unexpected beauty, has made something more complicated than a treatise against the power structures enshrined in the military, though he’s very aware of them."
The Inspection,"To be successful in confronting, understanding and dismantling the institutional homophobia that continues to be a cancer in American life requires depth, perspective, and a sense of inquiry—three qualities in short supply in The Inspection."
The Inspection,"The Inspection isn’t a perfect movie, but there are times when it feels like it’s tantalizingly close."
The Inspection,"Bratton’s movie largely looks and feels like a capable, confident bit of arthouse fare. But it opens up as Ellis’s mind goes places that it perhaps shouldn’t."
The Inspection,"You see everything coming from miles away... Bratton's command of the material compensates, and his re-creation of Parris Island without the participation of the military is impressive."
The Inspection,"A beautiful, heartfelt muddle."
The Inspection,"For all the intense physicality of his performance, Pope does much of his acting with his eyes, which can signal fear and anxiety one moment and radiate a defiant seductiveness the next."
The Inspection,"The metamorphosis that Bratton explores, and that Pope embodies — the way Ellis both changes and remains ever faithful to himself — is subtle, bittersweet and beautiful."
The Inspection,"Every frame of Elegance Bratton’s first fiction feature, set in 2005 and based loosely on his own experience, thrums with passion and purpose."
The Inspection,"Viewers with a high threshold for pain, suffering and humiliation may stay connected to this bio/drama. Others might not."
The Inspection,The ultimate goal of turning these young people into patriotic killing machines is framed as noble.
The Inspection,Has the trappings of an instant queer classic.
The Inspection,"Bratton crafts a raw and surreal viewing experience with ""The Inspection."""
The Inspection,The film is too invested in treacly cinematic optimism for its character dynamics to feel sketched out beyond their basic narrative function.
The Inspection,"[Witer-director Elegance Bratton] is not solely interested in a litany of struggle. He fills The Inspection with style, with spiky humor and alluring edge. It’s a promising feature debut."
The Inspection,There’s no denying that Elegance Bratton’s The Inspection is a moving drama. It wears that intention like a uniform.
The Inspection,"This is a human story, as messy and complex and maddening as any ever told, and while Bratton makes it his own (how could he not?), the generosity with which he shares it with us make it special indeed."
The Inspection,"[Bratton's] confidence as a film-maker might ultimately outpace his ability as a writer in the last act, but The Inspection still marks him out as one to watch."
The Inspection,"This deeply personal narrative debut is one gay Black man’s way of showing how he not only survived [his] experience, but was strengthened by it."
The Inspection,Pope is the beacon in a story interested in the personal pursuit of this heartbroken son but not in the vicious system surrounding him.
The Inspection,"Marks an accomplished narrative feature debut for writer-director Elegance Bratton, who draws on his own story to create one of the most stirring portraits of queer Black masculinity since Moonlight."
Tyson’s Run,Director/writer Kim Bass has put together a script that goes beyond how an underdog can find the courage to succeed and takes it to such an unbelievable level that the film suffers.
Tyson’s Run,Tyson's Run is a feel-good film and that's exactly what it's meant to be.
Tyson’s Run,"Ultimately Tyson's Run has enough heart and an uplifting story ""inspired by a real boy"" to balance out and offer a film that may speak especially to those with friends or family members on the spectrum."
Tyson’s Run,Just a feel good movie that tugs at your heart strings all the way through.
God’s Country,Julian Higgins takes this very intimate and specific story that could have been a lurid B-movie and makes it art.
God’s Country,Newton braids every thread of generational trauma into a lived-in symbol of defiance and anger.
God’s Country,Profound and haunting.
God’s Country,"Higgins has a feel for the poetry of the landscape, and he and his cinematographer, Andrew Wheeler, make effective use of the region’s majestic, sometimes eerie beauty."
God’s Country,"Higgins and Newton leave us with a bad taste in our mouths, and that’s a good thing."
God’s Country,It becomes as a whole an intoxicating watch.
God’s Country,It’s easy to dislike the bullies. Too easy. They’re cliché.
God’s Country,"It’s a thriller, a twisty one, and Newton is terrific in it."
God’s Country,"It's not perfect -- the symbolism cup overfloweth here, and don't get us started on the main character's backstory -- but Newton's performance and a palpable f----you-patriarchy righteousness pack a serious punch."
God’s Country,"A film that understands both form and content, merging the two in a story that feels less like a piece of suspenseful entertainment and more like a warning."
God’s Country,"It's a movie that keeps one eye on this local dustup and the other on a long, sorry sweep of American conquest and neglect."
God’s Country,Julian Higgins' auspicious feature debut employs genre violence to make social revolution explosively real.
God’s Country,"This is a spoiled land, presented confidently and with a contemporary focus that offers a nuanced take on white and male supremacy."
God’s Country,"Provocative, raising critical questions about boundaries, environmental stewardship, community, inclusion, grief and more. It is, however, a slow burn, requiring patience and attention."
God’s Country,"God's Country is a film from new voices, bristling with ambition."
God’s Country,"A disturbing, unusually class-and-race-conscious modern Western that paints a pretty despairing view of human relations in red state America."
God’s Country,"Higgins' excellent film constantly dangles redemption in front of our faces, begging us to imagine a better world, but ultimately delivers a stark reminder of how bitterly divided the country is."
God’s Country,"Race, class and cultural divides are probed with intriguing understatement in ""God's Country."""
God’s Country,"[An] often exhilarating, if occasionally overcooked, film."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Manville is perfect in the title role and the film, though fanciful, is very easy to take."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,It's a familiar formula but that's part of the charm.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"The film’s designers spent a lot of time exploring the Dior archives and it shows. It’s Mrs Harris’s story, but it’s also a fond tribute to a world that has changed beyond recognition."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,What’s so lovely is that Mrs. Harris Goes To Paris is a celebration of beauty and the importance of cherishing those special things in life that may seem silly to others but make us feel most like ourselves.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"It’s unabashed froth, as substantial as a tulle skirt. And perhaps that’s exactly what we need right now."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"... Against this backdrop of exploitation, decay and corruption, we’re asked to cheer for a brainwashed blue-collar cleaner who’s about to blow half a grand on a posh frock? The genius of the film, of course, is that we do."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"It is handsomely mounted, Manville mostly keeps the sentimentality under control, and if you are in the mood for something pleasantly untaxing you will be pleasantly untaxed."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,Director Anthony Fabian has made a broad and cheery snowglobe of a film.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"It’s a thoroughly pleasant if flimsy film... with a distinct perfume of nostalgia wafted towards us, say by the sight of Gitanes lit up on cross-channel flights."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Preposterous though it may be, this is a terrific family movie in a style audiences may not have seen since Mary Poppins."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Mrs Harris Goes to Paris could never be mistaken for a Ken Loach polemic. But whilst showing us a lot of pretty frocks, it gets awfully close to giving the finger to feudalism."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"It may sound dismissive to call a film ‘nice’, but that’s exactly what this is. It’s beautifully produced, entirely uncynical niceness. If you’re after just a lovely time, come on in and put your feet up."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,It benefits from the breathtaking couture of three-time Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan — dresses the movie treats as sacraments worthy of slowing down time — and for Lesley Manville’s performance in the lead.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"If viewers get stuck on the “this would never happen in real life” notion, they will miss the point of this charming tale."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,Manville... brings her own set of dynamics to the role and scores a huge personal triumph.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Lesley Manville delivers an effervescent performance that reminds us of her formidable comedic, as well as dramatic range."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,Few films from the past few years have given me as much continuous pleasure as Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris stretches a bit to make high and low meet harmoniously, but it often manages the feat, thanks especially to Manville. As a force of British charm, you could imagine her Ada one day teaming up with Paddington."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"It’s rare to find movies that value the mere idea of beauty, and this one—directed by Anthony Fabian—does so unapologetically."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,[Lesley Manville is] basically giving Paddington in a Phantom Thread setting.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"An engaging wisp of magic realism, featuring a London and Paris fit and stage-lit for a 1950s musical."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,This mid-century-set treat is as pretty and heartwarming as you can imagine.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Through it all, Manville treads a delicate line perilously close to making Mrs. Harris cloying, but somehow never oversteps."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,Longing for a sweet little surprise that transports you to a place of pure movie enchantment? Then check out the glorious Lesley Manville as a struggling London maid who travels to Paris to fulfill her Cinderella fantasy of owning a Dior gown.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"While Mrs. Harris may not always see herself that way, Manville shows us in every moment that the character’s discovery of her courage and value is as much a work of art as the meticulously constructed gowns of Dior."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"So benign and enjoyable viewers may find themselves uttering one of its heroine's oft-used refrains, ""Oh, that's lovely."" And for the romantics — not the cynics — in the audience, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"If everything else in ""Mrs. Harris"" is off the rack, she's [Lesley Manville] a hand-crafted designer dress."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,Lesley Manville charms as the good-natured London heroine.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"I was charmed by this unapologetic fairy tale about a cleaning woman who dreams of wearing a beautiful ball gown designed by Christian Dior. Lesley Manville is a marvel, and this film is a lovely vehicle for her—the perfect embodiment of Ada Harris."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,The movie delivers its chuckles and elicits its sighs in a calibrated narrative arc that softens the hard edges of its late bloomer’s life.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,If you’re allergic to this sort of thing it all sounds insufferable. But the film is very good at what it does -- gorgeous to look at and put together with manifest affection and care by director Anthony Fabian and crew.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Manville carries it all off effortlessly... She is playing a character who, without ever descending to easy sentiment, radiates goodness. At its best, that’s what this film does too."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Despite its gleeful showcasing of beautiful clothes and vibrant midcentury Parisian sights, the film is caught between its fantasies and its principles, landing somewhere more annoyingly clueless — and dull — than it ought to be."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"""Mrs. Harris"" is the kind of pleasingly old-fashioned movie that could have come out in its late-'50s time period, starring Deborah Kerr or Jennifer Jones."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"“Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris” never devolves into a preachy treatise. Instead, it’s a soothing tonic, a nice little escape from the troubles of the world."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,Mrs Harris and her journey to Paris might not be one that stays with you for very long – one’s memory of the film might be as fleeting as her trip – but it’s so far the best escape many of us will have had this summer.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,Gives us an everyday superhero to root for.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Manville in any incarnation is one of the great pleasures of screen storytelling, especially now. And even at its most patronizing, “Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris” provides a generous, gentle stage for her most endearing qualities to shine through."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,It’s entirely inoffensive (not to mention a little boring) in its pursuit of a moment or two’s frothy confection.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris is a nourishing, if fleeting, summer holiday that can be enjoyed for far less than the cost of couture."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"It is perhaps the ultimate fantasy, that all good deeds go rewarded; making Mrs. Harris’s world punishing enough to drive suspense, but decent enough to work out, is a balancing act that director Fabian skillfully manages throughout the entire film."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"If director Fabian’s touch is a little heavy and coy, the actors lighten it every preordained step of the way."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"If you’re anxious and world-weary and you want the next season of Emily in Paris to hurry up and arrive, this film may be just the ticket."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"You want to know something special about this movie, don’t you? Well, it’s Lesley Manville. The script can be nonstop lies, but she finds the truth in it."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,Enchanting.
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"In the tradition of Britain’s class comedies, what makes 'Mrs. Harris Goes To Paris' comes down to the difference between, say, your average fashion designer and someone like Dior."
Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,"Fabian’s film is charming enough, though his attempts at romance remain largely earthbound as he makes a clean break from the earlier TV version, offering a different interpretation of the character."
Call Jane,"If Call Jane’s narrative is largely paint-by-numbers, its closing scene eschews narrative conventions. We are left with names, circumstances, the then-as-now cries for help, and the knowledge that there is so much more still to burn."
Call Jane,"[An] entertaining, if not exactly heavyweight, movie."
Call Jane,"Well told and well acted, but go seen the documentary [The Janes]."
Call Jane,A crowd-pleasing feel-good movie of personal empowerment.
Call Jane,"There is much to admire about it... However, it is painful to report that the script is a hot mess, often egregiously on the nose, and feels like the product of both pre and post-production editorial triage."
Call Jane,"Hardly as revolutionary as the activists it draws inspiration from, Call Jane is nonetheless a charming, big-hearted story of a fight for justice, and might just change a few minds along the way."
Call Jane,Call Jane is a drama that carries the ring of historical truth.
Call Jane,Call Jane would be more effective if it stuck to human drama rather than having its characters make sweeping assertions that sound like stump speeches given at political rallies
Call Jane,"[Nagy] is sensitive to the details, and sensitive to what the story needs."
Call Jane,"The film, despite its heavy subject, has a bright, vibrant energy. It’s not so much optimistic as galvanizing."
Call Jane,"We may all have the power to be Jane, but the image of Jane remains frustratingly hazy in Nagy’s depiction."
Call Jane,"Banks, a gifted and spirited comedic actress whose dramatic work is underrated... brings the right amount of defiance, warmth, strength and sparkle to her role. Not all the pieces here fit into place, but her Jane is worth a call. [Full review in Spanish]"
Call Jane,"A career-best performance by Elizabeth Banks and a spicy, Earth Mother turn by Sigourney Weaver are more than enough reasons to see Call Jane..."
Call Jane,"Should you see “Call Jane”? You bet. And not just because it’s satisfying to watch Banks, Weaver, Mosaku et al as feminists fighting the patriarchy with wit, intelligence and medical know-how. This is a story that needs to be told, again and again."
Call Jane,"Call Jane delivers a striking and affecting message that self-autonomy is crucial to survival, and that the fight for reproductive health is one that we can under no circumstances back down from."
Call Jane,"The writers clearly intended to personalize the abortion conversation through their Everywoman protagonist, and Banks ably fills that role. Still, turning this into one woman’s story shrinks the narrative at least as much as it universalizes it."
Call Jane,"Few know how to tease out threads of repression in a society like Nagy. The conventional approach of Call Jane is a statement, itself. This could be anyone’s story."
Call Jane,"For a heavy-duty subject, Call Jane is anything but, moving along almost like a lighthearted Lifetime movie."
Call Jane,[Nagy] strains to shepherd a narrative that zips along in a haze of underserved storylines.
Call Jane,"Nagy and Banks simply give us the privilege of watching someone slowly grow at a real, measured pace."
Call Jane,"Nagy’s accessible crowd-pleaser rallies around two passionate performances, one from Elizabeth Banks... and another from Sigourney Weaver."
Call Jane,"I’m grateful for this solid, serviceable tribute to activists who provided a blueprint for mutual aid and community care. We can really use it right now."
Call Jane,"The insightful script wisely takes a touchy subject, makes it personal and centers it around the most unlikely protagonist."
Call Jane,"""Call Jane"" uses a light touch to make the abortion experience feel exactly as it should: normal."
Call Jane,"Banks is very good, but the decision to tell this story through its most privileged character feels like a misstep, a screenwriter's calculation that limits rather than widens the movie's scope."
Call Jane,It's too shallow and more interested in what it's about than how it is about it.
Call Jane,"While you know the stakes are high, Call Jane never seems particularly interested in proving it."
Call Jane,"A meticulous, if not revelatory, film..."
Call Jane,The film consistently fails to underline the risks and pressures faced by the women in an underground abortionist network in Chicago in the late '60s.
Call Jane,"It approaches its serious subject with a smile, falling comfortably alongside the likes of On the Basis of Sex and Misbehaviour as a cheerful, accessible feminist drama."
Call Jane,"Banks is asked to do a lot to portray Joy, tracking her through major changes in a minimum of time, and the actress delivers."
Call Jane,"Keeping the film grounded in character, Nagy eloquently reminds us at every turn that what has been labeled a crime is a medical procedure, and underscores how personal all this is for the women."
Call Jane,"Without giving in to bromides, the cha-cha, surprisingly feel-good rhythms of Nagy's direction make this heroine's sudden sense of purpose rather exhilarating."
Call Jane,"The female empowerment message comes through loud and clear in ""Call Jane,"" especially in Banks' performance. What's missing from the picture is the threat of discovery..."
Call Jane,"Avoids the trap of issue-film sensationalism, focusing on the spark and spirit of communal endeavor even as it addresses pitfalls of race and privilege in the Janes' efforts."
Met Opera: The Hours,ERROR
The Tiger Rising,"Stodgy storytelling... plays out with no mystery, ambiguity or subtlety."
The Tiger Rising,"Too bad the rest of the movie isn't as captivating as the big, beautiful cat at its center."
The Tiger Rising,The metaphors are so obvious that the film becomes trapped in its own cage of archetypes and clichés...
The Tiger Rising,"Director/screenwriter Giarratana occasionally summons up a lovely moment, although the overall tone is inconsistent."
The Tiger Rising,Exceptional special effects lend a touch of magic that both softens some of the harsher material and helps keep us inside the children's point of view.
Man of God,"The ""find-your-way-back-to-your-church-and-your-family"" premise is ludicrously illogical given the movies warts-and-all treatment of Big Time Protestantism in one of Africas most populous countries."
Man of God,"Man of God ultimately foregoes the complexity of its religious subject matter for a simplistic, troubling message."
Redeeming Love,"This movie thinly scatters a parable’s worth of plot across 134 minutes and resembles HBO’s Deadwood recut for Sunday-school purposes: pious, puzzling and punitive, with a sternly wagging finger never far from entering the frame."
Redeeming Love,Redeeming Love could have tried to reach a broader audience but settles for preaching to the choir.
Redeeming Love,"""Love"" might be best embraced by the faithful, but it is well made and has much to say about the healing power of love and how we all deserve second chances."
Redeeming Love,Redeeming Love is like the most expensive community theatre production you've ever seen. The acting is just not there.
Redeeming Love,"It's so hard to shake the lingering icky feelings about this text, which plays like ""tradwife"" fan fiction, the 19th-century setting protecting the story from the pesky ""women's lib"" movement, which would suggest that Angel have her own autonomy."
Redeeming Love,There's something icky about this love story.
Redeeming Love,The film is too narrow-minded to explore the notion that a saint-like man may want to satisfy his normal carnal desires.
Till,"The screenplay, by the director in collaboration with Michael Reilly and Keith Beauchamp, is filled with rich detail, such as the different ways in which attendees at the trial are treated according to their colour."
Till,"Till distinguishes itself with the intimacy of its approach. As well as possessing a luminous beauty made for close-ups, Deadwyler, displays a deep understanding of Mamie’s grief and her urge to make her son’s memory stand for something."
Till,"A sensational acting showcase for Deadwyler, as Mamie shifts from devastated mother to reluctant activist."
Till,Chukwu prefers humans to saints and fluid film-making is her thing.
Till,"Chinonye Chukwu, working with a talented and mostly flawless cast, has established the film’s venomously racist Jim Crow-era milieu so profoundly that the exchange bristles with shock and sickening dread."
Till,Chukwu asks us to look beyond individual legal outcomes and see the bigger picture – to take strength from tragedy and find hope even in despair.
Till,"Against the distress, Chukwu and Deadwyler find purpose in Mamie’s transformation into a hugely influential civil rights activist. This is a woman’s account of striving for racial justice."
Till,Till honours something more important: the power of a picture that speaks the truth.
Till,"... An absorbing, slow-burning study of a broken woman’s politicisation. She is superbly served by star Danielle Deadwyler, who transforms Till from a good film into a gripping one."
Till,"Well worth your time, especially if this story is a blind spot."
Till,Till is a fierce portrait of courage and a sombre study of the human cost involved in resisting this kind of barbarity.
Till,It is an honest depiction of an American tragedy. It forces us to remember a time that many would prefer to forget.
Till,"She's [Danielle Deadwyler] got something, and it's on full display in this film."
Till,"An impassioned melodrama on the surface, unafraid of facing tragedy head-on and allowing ample space for grief, anger, and fear, but which is also a wise movie about the complicatedly political world Mamie Till finds herself in."
Till,Danielle Deadwyler gives the breakout performance of the year as a Black activist mother who used the 1955 lynching of her son Emmett Till to galvanize the civil-rights movement. Chinonye Chukwu crafts this emotional powerhouse into essential viewing.
Till,What distinguishes Till from most other well-intentioned films telling similarly themed stories set during this tumultuous era of American history is the absence of white saviors.
Till,It’s but one aspect of Deadwyler’s performance which is such that “powerful” is an insufficient term to describe it.
Till,An engrossing Civil Rights drama that could turn its little-known star into an Oscar winner.
Till,"Ultimately and unfortunately, Till is a film that covers important events, but doesn’t quite feel like it adds enough to the story to be an important film."
Till,"“Till” is a quintessential Good For You movie, but it’s also a good movie, rich with detail and beautifully directed..."
Till,You have to witness Danielle Deadwyler's performance.
Till,"“Till” feels slightly old fashioned, usually in a good way."
Till,"Sometimes the love between a mother and son is so strong it doesn’t die, even after death. That’s what audiences will see here. That’s what they will take away. A love and strength that endures."
Till,A film that offers a stinging historical reminder of America’s history of racial injustice at a time where some are seeking to prevent that history from being taught.
Till,"Till favors convention, sticking to familiar beats even in a story that forced people to open their eyes."
Till,"Mamie Till-Mobley is just one of countless Black mothers in America who have lost children to hate crimes. ""Till"" painfully reminds us that we're still waiting for justice in the majority of these cases."
Till,"For the second film running, Chukwu has given a black actress one heck of a showcase."
Till,“Till” confirms Chukwu as an actor’s director and should establish Deadwyler as a major presence in movies.
Till,Deadwyler... instantly cements her status as one of the most exciting performers working today.
Till,"Through Deadwyler’s powerful performance, viewers will feel the palpable fear of Black mothers knowing they can never fully protect their Black children in white America."
Till,"While it eschews the familiar rhythms of the biopic, it’s never able to commit to being about Mamie’s journey as deeply as it would like to be."
Till,"Till is an affirmation of just how much Emmett Till’s life mattered, and continues to matter long beyond his last breath."
Till,This film will put a knot in your stomach from the very beginning.
Till,"a true achievement of filmmaking to create an emotional, affecting portrait of a mother and an unlikely civil rights pioneer, and to pay loving tribute to the life and death of Emmett Till."
Till,"Anchored by Danielle Deadwyler’s towering performance, it’s a wrenching portrayal of reluctant heroism under the most horrific of parental circumstances."
Till,"It bridges the past and 2022, when the Emmett Till Antilynching Act defined lynching as a hate crime."
Till,"As Mamie Till, the previously little-known actress Danielle Deadwyler gives an astonishing performance, shimmering first with tenderness and later with the kind of agony no mother should ever have to contemplate, much less bear."
Till,"“Till” is a work of mighty cinematic portraiture, with a range of closeups of Mamie that infuse the film with an overwhelming combination of subjective depth and an outward sense of purpose."
Till,Mrs. Bradley is played with infinite grace and dignity by Danielle Deadwyler in a performance that is one of the most thrilling of the year.
Till,Quietly stunning scenes emerge throughout.
Till,"Deadwyler... brings a haunted immediacy to Mamie even when the screenplay doesn't rise to meet her, grief and fury and fierce dignity passing across her face in annihilating waves."
Till,"Chukwu revisits the past while doing something extremely difficult. She makes this grim American history insistently of the moment — and she does so by stripping the story down to its raw, harrowing emotional core."
Till,Chukwu has shown a great knack for collaboration with actors and drawing marvelous performances out of them (see Alfre Woodard and Aldis Hodge’s staggering work in Clemency). She evidences it again with Deadwyler in Till.
Till,Danielle Deadwyler makes powerful choices as Chicago’s Mamie Till-Mobley.
Till,"Propelled by Deadwyler’s unforgettable portrayal, “Till” leaves us with a sense of an indictment still unanswered in 2022."
Till,It’s the specific way Chukwu maps out and steers us through the terrible events that gives “Till” its stark and sometimes revelatory power.
Till,"Deadwyler gives a career-making performance as Mamie, perfectly poised between grief and strength. The film, which is dedicated to Mamie, ultimately belongs to her."
Till,"Rising to challenge viewers’ qualms about the movie’s existence is Deadwyler, whose stirring performance may be reason enough to see the film."
Till,"If nothing else, see it for Danielle Deadwyler’s incredible performance. She truly is unforgettable."
Till,"Danielle Deadwyler takes all of that pressure, pain, and misery and transforms that into a powerful performance that anchors the entire film."
Till,"It’s that kind of rich detail, regarding Deadwyler’s star-making performance and the deliberateness of the creative choices, that makes “Till” such an assured and daring, well-calibrated feature by Chukwu."
Till,The film has a powerful weapon in its arsenal in Danielle Deadwyler’s transfixing performance as a broken woman who finds formidable strength within herself.
Till,"In her terrific performance as the mother of Emmett Till, Danielle Deadwyler wrestles a ghastly American tragedy into a story of resilience crucial to the civil rights movement."
Till,"Important history told seriously, real people rendered sensitively. There is a purpose in that."
Till,This magnificent performance elevates Deadwyler to the ranks of the great actors of our time.
Till,The film taps into to a deeper well of emotions than most biopics.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Visually rich and thematically dense, Three Thousand Years of Longing muses on romance and possession, as well as the slow death of mythology and folklore at the hands of science and capitalism."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,A feast for the head and the heart and the eyes.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Rhythm is essential when talking about Miller. Three Thousand Years certainly isn’t the intricate symphony of chaos that Fury Road was, but there’s an underlying musicality that glides it along."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Where Mad Max: Fury Road was lean, Three Thousand Years of Longing feels like a rough draft that should have stayed in a dusty bin somewhere in the middle of a tourist shop."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"At the heart of this romantically grand “chamber piece” is a passionate declaration, and as well a sincere defense, of the innate human desire for fantasy."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"There’s something rather sterile and bloodless in the film’s approach, with its synthetic and soul-sappingly clean-looking CGI. Plus there’s the palpable lack of chemistry between the leads..."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Something very different, and succeeding so spectacularly."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,Three Thousand Years of Longing stands in defiance of all of Fury Road’s sagest lessons. The film sags where it should speed; it mumbles when it should pronounce; it narrows when it should expand.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"It’s no blockbuster. It wasn’t designed that way. But it’s audacious, funny and consistently inventive with a lot of charm."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"On paper, Miller’s film sounds more than little out there, but there is something pleasing and more than a little satisfying about a film which completely commits to its narrative without added airs and graces."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,Elba is great as the hopelessly romantic immortal. Swinton’s even better as the no-nonsense human hiding a tender core.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,Three Thousand Years of Longing has much to recommend it and anyone who loves a good story will appreciate George Miller’s ability to tell not one but many.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Miller finds in it something gentle, ingenuous and heartfelt: like rediscovering a forgotten children’s movie previously available only on VHS."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"An impossible movie. A strange and bewitching fairy tale for adults, unfashionable in its cerebral whimsy and mid-budget wizardry."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,'Three Thousand Years of Longing' doesn't realize its romantic fantasy is a horror story.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Three Thousand Years of Longing actually ends on a creative high note, but the path to that conclusion is filled with muddled adventures that play like something out of a 1980s B-movie. We find ourselves longing for the credits to roll."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Elba’s performance as a lonely Djinn with a bottomless reserve of charm, paired with Miller’s unbridled energy, make this a modern fairy tale worth seeking out."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"For all the film’s sprawling movements across history, the small-scale love story at its core is what makes it as arresting as Miller’s loudest hits."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Miller asks the audience to level up its existential exploration, posing questions about the purpose of storytelling... but the film doesn’t offer any concrete answers, leaving us adrift in a sea of provocative queries."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"It is the story of life, and as frustrating and maddening as that can be, it’s also quite beautiful: the continual hope for a better tomorrow is a wish worth making, no matter what the risks."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Three Thousand Years of Longing is indeed a cautionary tale, but it’s a complex, beautiful one, suggesting that love, longing, and loss are all parts of a vast, wondrous life."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"It's always visually wondrous, but the actual stories at play, strangely enough, are kinda dull."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,It’s charming to see George Miller take a long-standing interest in the power of storytelling and craft a fairy tale that still somehow feels raw and intimate.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"The movie is a mixed bag, almost by design. It doesn’t always work. But gosh, does it try."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Even with its lumps and misdemeanors, I not only enjoyed it, I prize it and celebrate its existence."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"This romantic fantasy from visionary director George Miller is all over the place structurally, but odds are you won't be too bothered given the sparks ignited by Tilda Swinton and Idris Elba as a magical djinn hellbent on granting her three wishes."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Some of these tales are vivid and involving, but what they add up to is less than the sum of its many shimmering parts. Even still, the movie has its undeniable pleasures."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Suffused with hypnotic visuals and anchored by a tremendous performance by Idris Elba, the movie takes its cues from the fantasy workings of Guillermo del Toro and is only occasionally found wanting."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"The movie, though a frantic treat for the retina, is also oddly inactive."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"The visionary Miller has a gift for wonder. with striking, gorgeous images and swoon-worthy stories of passion — greedy, jealous, ambitious, angry, lustful, romantic."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"The result is a film that uses its own clichés to undermine expectations, turning age-old tropes into thrilling fantasy."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"A floaty head-trip with some keen ideas. But its potential is never fully realized, and it comes off like a wish gone ungranted."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"I loved ""Three Thousand Years,"" even as I remained aware I'm destined to be part of a small group."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"'Three Thousand Years Of Longing' undercuts its own effectiveness as a singular piece, presenting less as a unified vision of an auteur director than a scattershot assemblage of motifs, philosophies, and themes in search of a spine to hold them together."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"While the last half-hour is lovely — it’s here that you see the movie, and feel the tenderness, that Miller himself clearly yearns to convey — by then, alas, the clock has almost run out."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,[Miller's] mastery makes the movie eye-popping; his freedom and audacity make it surprising and unsettling.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Miller’s go-for-broke visuals and his stars’ fiercely committed work allow Three Thousand to speed by on wit, energy, and gushy, bleeding-heart passion."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"What should be a cinematic journey into amazement and otherworldly adventure instead becomes a tedious, word-heavy slog — all the more disappointing considering the director in charge is George Miller."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Having nothing to prove, Miller can flirt with silliness and embrace idiosyncrasy. Having a lot to offer, he can get away with the one and enjoy the other."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,The trouble with “Three Thousand Years of Longing” is it’s just not that wondrous or interesting.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,Those who elect to submerge themselves into Miller’s fantasy will walk away with a renewed sense of hope and maybe even a lump in their throats.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"There is not a cynical molecule in the makeup of George Miller's Three Thousand Years of Longing, a patient and occasionally dazzling fantasy about love, myth, hope, companionship and perhaps, most of all, about storytelling."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Despite being stuffed full of inventive, near-visionary visuals, “Three Thousand Years of Longing” winds up feeling a little incomplete. The story lacks the one thing the djinn promises: magic."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"It’s a flawed, but intoxicating kaleidoscope of stories. If only the film ending were as strong as its beginning and middle."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,George Miller’s film is a passionate exploration of how image-making is inextricable from storytelling.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"A more mainstream, milquetoast variation of The Fall, and doesn’t come even close to matching this former film for heart and aesthetic flair."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Sentimental, fantastical, and unabashedly moony, it’s a romance and a storytelling apologia all in one."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,A visual dazzler that wears its fantasy elements lightly and with playful humour.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"The fundamental problem is that the djinn's anecdotes just aren't enchanting enough. They are sprinkled with wonderful little details, but none of them has compelling characters or a satisfying pay-off."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"It makes interesting observations about how stories help us make sense of our world, but suffers from a glaring lack of chemistry between the two leads."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"A man cannot live on Thunderdomes alone, apparently."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,It’s a film that passionately believes in the power of storytelling and its ability to make sense of the world — but it’s also about the value of accepting love.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Feels like a folly at times, but always a worthwhile folly."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Even though Three Thousand Years of Longing offers plenty of rapturous imagery, the arrow it shoots from its mighty bow just doesn’t pierce as it should."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"If I could have one wish, it would be that I had rewatched Arabian Nights (or Wishmaster) instead of this. But that’s okay – there will be more than enough people for whom this off-beat fantasy is everything they ever longed for."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"While Swinton and Elba make smooth work of the fairy-tale-toned dialogue, they simply lack the chemistry to make their tryst convince as romance. And the fantasy flashbacks too often sink into chintz..."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Miller has earned the right to make whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and to hell with the fans who demand more road warrior movies. I think that he made this one just for him. I suspect it’s turned out exactly as he hoped."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,George Miller returns to with a sumptuous banquet of storytelling in service of storytelling.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,This cerebrally sexy shot of One Thousand and One Nights-adjacent whimsy strains so hard for beguilement and timelessness that it’s ponderous and heavy.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"I’m not sure what Miller is trying to say about desire and fulfilment but Swinton and Elba are such soulful, beautiful creatures. Even if they don’t have physical chemistry, they share a sense of beguiling preposterousness."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Like Mad Max: Fury Road before it, Three Thousand Years of Longing is another kind of blockbuster that tries to lead by example, a big-budget fantasia that argues there are more imaginative and original ways for Hollywood to employ its tools."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"Great pleasure ensues from the constant presence of both Elba and Swinton, who are alert to every possibility presented by the script and then add so much more to it in the bargain; both performances are nothing short of marvelous."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,Maybe jaded audiences will appreciate how self-consciously innovative Miller’s spin on the djinn movie is trying to be. Or maybe they’ll find themselves asking why someone with Alithea’s training can’t tell a more coherent story.
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"George Miller could find more cinema in a single hotel minibar than some contemporary directors could squeeze out of an entire galaxy far, far away, and he manages to do exactly that without unbalancing the delicate soul of [this] intimate two-hander."
Three Thousand Years of Lon…,"It’s a curious film, messy in all its ambition but consistently transfixing, an earnest labor of love -- and one about love."
After Ever Happy,Can’t even charitably be said to be blah. It’s the space between the blahs.
Spoiler Alert,Sometimes the tone is a little too cute but Showalter and his writers have a persuasive ability to defuse the looming threat of sentimentality with comedy.
Spoiler Alert,"It sounds like a really heavy, sad story, and it is, but there's so much fun and joy... it's about life and the messiness of love."
Spoiler Alert,"Spoiler Alert is a delightfully effective melodrama, one that pulls few punches and isn’t afraid of wearing a plethora of emotions out in the open for all to see."
Spoiler Alert,This is a nice film. A sweet film. A film you can watch with your mother-in-law.
Spoiler Alert,"... While it eventually finds its sweet core, its surrounded by the shards of a much more interesting story."
Spoiler Alert,"A tender, inspiring story."
Spoiler Alert,Parsons and Aldridge have fantastic chemistry together.
Spoiler Alert,"As you’d expect, Sally Field and Bill Irwin are great together as Kit’s parents, who are so loving and accepting, you wonder why Kit waited so long to come out to them."
Spoiler Alert,"Spoiler Alert is at its best when it's not afraid to be mawkish, sentimental, soppy, honest, and downright charming."
Spoiler Alert,A beautifully balanced and well-paced film that knows when to be brutally honest and when to give viewers a moment of reprieve.
Spoiler Alert,"When the film lets its guard down—namely, whenever Aldridge gets to deploy his charm as Kit or manages to let Field echo a weathered kind of Steel Magnolias screen presence—the film sings."
Spoiler Alert,"Unlike so many “illness movies” — I’m looking at you, Nicholas Sparks — Kit’s life is not mined for the lessons it teaches us."
Spoiler Alert,"Reaches for humor without jokes... once in a while a few films achieve that, and this is one of them."
Spoiler Alert,"At times “Spoiler Alert” feels like an edgy, clever film that plays wittily on the main character’s lifelong obsession with TV. At others, it feels like a more formulaic, holiday-themed tearjerker."
Spoiler Alert,"The film is a testament to the beautiful greys in love that may sting in the moment, but when a bigger picture is forced upon us, are appreciated for the balance they provide."
Spoiler Alert,"This is probably best to skip if you have history of helping a loved one through cancer, but for everyone else it’s a solid weekend watch once it hits streaming."
Spoiler Alert,Showalter ultimately succeeds because he never loses focus of the heart at the core of his story.
Spoiler Alert,Spoiler alert: we deserve better.
Spoiler Alert,"We know from the beginning where the witty and warm Spoiler Alert is headed, but not how moving that journey will be."
Spoiler Alert,"A bigger problem is that the so-called sincere dialogue is either blunter than a soap opera (“It’s his mother. He told her not to come. I’ve never even met the woman.”) or hammier than a Hawaiian pizza (“Hey honey, I’m cancer! I mean, I’m home!”)"
Spoiler Alert,"Despite the narrative elements that are part of Michael’s coping mechanisms, Aldridge and Field effectively salvage the emotional core of “Spoiler Alert,” bringing us back to the heart of the matter."
Spoiler Alert,"It’s heartfelt, genuine, funny and yes, terribly sad but it also celebrates love and life, even when it’s dealing with a tragic illness."
Spoiler Alert,"The film challenges itself to be both amusing and emotionally involving where matters of life and death are concerned. Fortunately, it manages to more or less succeed on both counts due to its ever-ready wise-crack nature and sympathetic direction."
Spoiler Alert,"It made me cry at the end, but my tears were as canned and untrustworthy as the sound of a sitcom laugh track. I could barely remember what I had just watched."
Spoiler Alert,"Unfortunately, too much of the movie simply doesn’t work."
Spoiler Alert,"Many of the scenes here seem to have been shot in a spirit of tense desperation; the comedy doesn’t land, the romance takes too long to get going, and the tearjerking scenes are spoiled by a meta framework that makes Showalter’s job even more difficult."
Spoiler Alert,"This is a love story that’s frank about the waning of passion, the ebb of sexual desire, the curdling of affection into irritation, infidelity and the seeming death knell of the trial separation."
Spoiler Alert,"To the film’s credit, it never wallows in false sentimentality or asks us to feel pity for these characters. I’d say more, but I don’t want to spoil the ending."
The Godfather,"I could have sworn it was a gay fantasia of what toxic masculinity sounds like. It's that ""off."""
The Godfather,"There was a possibility of using the same story and making something worth a viewer's time, but this isn't it."
Running The Bases,"Running the Bases is also sure to capture baseball lovers' attention with its realistic portrayal of the sport. The plot sparks laughter, tears, and a feeling of sentimentality."
Running The Bases,"As a faith-based drama, Running the Bases has the expected religious preaching. Some of the movie's supporting performances are subpar. But this good-natured movie is saved by an appealing lead performance by Brett Varvel and some laugh-out-loud comedy."
Running The Bases,"A grand slam! A warm, captivating and genuinely heartfelt journey well worth taking."
Infinite Storm,"It is well-photographed, the epic adventure is harrowing, and Naomi Watts earns more deserved applause for being one of the gamest actors in films today."
Infinite Storm,"I don't think a lot of the ideas in it land that much, but I enjoyed it as a sort of physical exercise."
Infinite Storm,"It’s exhausting. Watts is game, fit and makeup free, but it’s starting to seem like the actress has a rescue-or-be-rescued fixation."
Infinite Storm,There are crackerjack action scenes that make the most of the real locations as well as the actors' phenomenal tenacity and strength.
Infinite Storm,"Not to get all Aristotelian about it, but for a plot to be more than just a succession of incidents, it needs some kind of mindful opposition to the protagonist’s efforts. This “Infinite Storm” lacks."
Infinite Storm,"This misframed effort does itself no favors by claiming its nonfiction bona fides so prominently to its promotion and opening credits, and then flogging them so repeatedly."
Infinite Storm,"The details of the story are emotionally draining, but that sensation derives mostly from the situation rather than the characters."
Infinite Storm,Watts is particularly brilliant at articulating a character’s inner being; she brings out what lies beneath so clearly and persuasively that you can see every thought and emotion fluttering into existence.
Infinite Storm,"Quibbles aside, this is a daring and memorable depiction of trauma, compassion and resilience."
Infinite Storm,"A harrowing, life-or-death story that has been drained of power to score melodramatic points that feel — however true — unearned."
Infinite Storm,A resonant ending elevates Naomi Watts’ mountain thriller...
Infinite Storm,"Remarkable as the true story behind this emotionally detached survival drama might be, the non-fiction label it staples to itself during the opening credits steels viewers for an urgency that never develops."
Infinite Storm,"If it falls a bit short as human drama... Szumowska’s latest — a 180-degree turn from her last, the excellent Polish allegorical tale “Never Gonna Snow Again” — is fully satisfying as an appreciation of Nature as magnificent adversary."
Infinite Storm,A paper-thin but gorgeously shot survivalist drama.
Infinite Storm,"As survival cinema, it has a certain rough, unpredictable energy. Its the aftermath, in which we learn the roots of Pams own trauma, and what her experience with John meant, that exposes it as a well-intentioned but uneven film about grief."
Infinite Storm,"Not only does Infinite Storm lack for a complete vision, its all too comfortable in settling for mawkishness."
She Said,"It's a great, strong film. Those two leads are incredible in it."
She Said,"It’s pulsing with emotional and social depth, and given that She Said is a familiar story, it’s remarkable it can still be insightful and surprising."
She Said,She Said is a powerful film and a timely one.
She Said,It's very powerful and well-acted... A tribute to dogged journalism.
She Said,"No gratuitous reenactments of assault, no horrifying climactic events... It's riveting."
She Said,"She Said is not self-congratulatory; it’s a reminder that empathy can require immense effort, and that even then, such effort might not lead to certain success."
She Said,"... The movie has a frankness and clarity of purpose to defy even the edgiest troll, a sturdy pulse embodied by a coolly furious Mulligan."
She Said,"Schrader’s sensitive, unshowy approach to the directing choices is a smart decision; this is a film that is respectful of and in service to the stories of the women."
She Said,[P]acks a punch.
She Said,An exciting and often powerful piece of mainstream film-making that allows its heroes to emerge as normal people who make everyday mistakes. Highly recommended.
She Said,Even if you know where it’s going — which you certainly do provided that you’ve had internet access at least once in the last few years — there’s a thrill in getting to the inevitable takedown of Harvey Weinstein.
She Said,"While Kazan often feels a little out of her depth, the film’s narrative is carried throughout by its peripheral characters rather than the main protagonists with Morton rescuing the film from its needlessly detailed and repetitive tone."
She Said,"I admire the way it takes the macho cliched nonsense out of journalism in movies: these are not boozy guys being adorable and chaotic, but smart, persistent people doggedly doing their job."
She Said,Pedestrian in style but compelling and deeply moving at times.
She Said,She Said is as enthralling as it is infuriating.
She Said,"For all She Said employs crescendo strings, it is not a thriller: there is not one moment of tension or fear. What are the “stakes”, you ask? The leads worry Ronan Farrow’s New Yorker article will come out first. With respect: are you kidding me?"
She Said,She Said is good. But grubbiness could have made it great.
She Said,"[She Said] doesn’t add much to the existing record. What it does do, when it’s good, is something the news headlines could not: It dramatizes the survivors’ voices on camera."
She Said,"For the most part, She Said provides involving material that doesn’t forget the victims in the process of telling how their stories brought down one of Hollywood’s ogres."
She Said,A worthy entry to a film genre that includes Spotlight and of course All the President’s Men.
She Said,"At a time when journalism is often under siege, there’s value in displaying its noblest qualities and loftiest aspirations. Even with hiccups and quibbles, She Said achieves that central mission."
She Said,"As an exercise, the movie is an admirable endeavor. Still, that doesn’t make it entirely successful. The result reveals little and is almost suffocatingly restrained."
She Said,"Regardless of this story’s ultimately explosive impact, She Said is simply a story of journalists at work."
She Said,"A solid, conventional film, skillfully made."
She Said,"Despite pokey pacing, the human drama of how two female reporters, superbly acted by Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan, persuaded women to go on the record about being sexually harassed by producer Harvey Weinstein is the year's most gripping detective story."
She Said,"As a lover of movies about journalism, I ate up every detail of the drama inside the Times building, even while knowing that I was watching a more polished and streamlined version of events."
She Said,"The movie is artfully balanced between its leads, and both Mulligan and Kazan excel."
She Said,"Most art about journalism screws up the journalism part. ""She Said"" does not."
She Said,“She Said” is successful where it matters most: It shows just how easy it is for predatory men in power to be kept there by an equally corrupt system of people who either look the other way or protect them.
She Said,She Said is not a ground-breaking tale. What makes it interesting is the depiction of Megan and Jodi as working moms who are forced to struggle within a system that prioritizes male needs.
She Said,"Even at the mighty New York Times, journalism is less romantic than it was in the days of All the President’s Men; She Said is not a thrilling movie but rather a satisfying one."
She Said,It’s a bore.
She Said,"With care, thoughtfulness and rigor, Schrader and the filmmakers of “She Said” craft a film that shows the process of building this paradigm-shifting piece of journalism in a manner that is simultaneously thrilling and grindingly methodical,"
She Said,"It falls into nearly every trap that awaits a journalism film, even featuring sequences in which characters type or stand around gazing into computer monitors, both of which exert considerable deflationary pull on drama."
She Said,"She Said is a very measured movie — it makes Spotlight look bombastic in comparison — that never hits a false note. On the record, it's absolutely one of the year's best."
She Said,She Said seems less intent on dramatizing the events of Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey’s investigation than simply relating them.
She Said,She Said gets it right in showing the work that went into exposing Harvey Weinstein.
She Said,"She Said feels not just important, but urgent."
She Said,It’s a natural companion piece to Spotlight... Both give you an authentic taste of the workings of a great newspaper when it chooses a cause and goes for broke.
She Said,She Said doesn’t pretend that wrongs have been righted once and for all. It just wants to pay tribute to two people stood up to a Goliath and took him down not with one good shot but a million tiny cuts and a lot of hard work.
She Said,"A riveting cinematic quest for journalistic truth – especially one like “She Said,” which tackles an issue that means so much to so many – should always be embraced, no matter the era."
She Said,"Perhaps 'She Said' will age well for future audiences looking back on this moment in time, but here and now it feels like Kantor and Twohey’s reporting does just fine speaking for itself."
She Said,"It's faithfully acted by an earnest, intelligent cast, and directed with fervent purpose by Maria Schrader."
She Said,"Schrader makes many wise choices, including using taped testimony, rather than a re-enactment, to illustrate the abuse without exploiting the case."
She Said,“She Said” details a triumph of journalistic sympathy and precision.
She Said,"A well-made, old-fashioned journalism movie about the New York Times investigation that brought down Harvey Weinstein."
She Said,"A moving and engaging film about finding truth, told through the perspective of two people who are very, very good at their jobs."
She Said,"It lags in a few places, but “She Said” gives you a journalism story to cheer for."
She Said,A solid dramatization of the reporting that launched the #MeToo era and changed workplaces around the world.
She Said,"“She Said” takes a story we thought we knew and gives it new, utterly shattering life."
She Said,"You watch. You listen. You learn. A reckoning, regarding the maltreatment of women, happens right before your eyes. Astounding drama."
She Said,[An] artless Wikipedia entry of an Oscar competitor.
She Said,"The film’s strength is in its slow-build, the cross-cut and a screenplay which pays close attention to every little detail."
She Said,"As the camera lingers on the dreadful scenes of an abuser’s hotel room, women’s voices fill the space he once inhabited. Survivors become bigger, louder, and more powerful, with their own enduring cinematic legacy."
She Said,"She Said aspires to be a great journalism movie, but All the President’s Men and Spotlight feel like action romps compared to director Maria Schrader’s committed slog through modern reporting. Her sets function largely like Zoom backgrounds."
She Said,"The script frames the profession as mentally taxing and unglamorous, far from how Hollywood typically portrays journalists in New York City."
She Said,One of those films that mistakes loud-and-clear moral positioning for satisfying drama.
She Said,"Powerful drama, artfully told."
She Said,"Maybe it’s strange that a film about rampant abuse should feel so warm, but She Said is heated by its steadfast compassion, its determination that the right thing be done and remembered."
She Said,"In Maria Schrader’s artful and incendiary She Said, we’re reminded of something else that makes for one hell of a movie: It was women who did it."
She Said,"A marvel. It’s not smug or preachy and gives space to the non-glamorous figures, many of them men, who helped Twohey and Kantor in their quest."
She Said,"It's powerful stuff, made all the more haunting by the fact that history is very much the present."
She Said,Sensible and engaging.
She Said,"“She Said” is a tense, fraught, and absorbing movie, one that sticks intriguingly close to the nuts and bolts of what reporters do."
She Said,"Like the book, She Said imparts the mountain of turmoil, obstacles, dead-ends, relationships and uncertainty which undergird a single story – all the work and doubt and strength we cannot see at first."
She Said,"It’s not a particularly artful film, with one too many exterior shots of the Times’ office and a rote score by Nicholas Brittell, but it’s tough not to get increasingly invested in Kantor and Twohey’s work."
She Said,"Wholly inert, and no more evocative than the reportage upon which it’s based."
Armageddon Time,"Armageddon Time is the rare case where the bitterness overwhelms sweetness, and true enlightenment comes from rejecting nostalgia at every turn."
Armageddon Time,"Preteen drama is amplified by robust and fairly obvious musical choices, but more interesting is the sound design: the city is everywhere, grumbling and fractious, the sound of a short fuse burning out."
Armageddon Time,"Gray’s latest, Armageddon Time, is a flawed work. But it sees the filmmaker at his most vulnerable, as he twists the camera back on himself and asks: of all the paths that brought me here, how many were carved out by my own privilege?"
Armageddon Time,"Both young actors give strong performances, which is more than you can say for Jeremy Strong and Anne Hathaway, both laying it on too thick as Paul’s highly strung parents."
Armageddon Time,"Both a coming of age and an exploration of an era, this self-biographical reminiscence feels both regretful and hopeful – a filmmaker trying to make peace. It’s not sugar-coated, but it’s full of love."
Armageddon Time,"The real nourishment comes from unflinching honesty, served with compassion, insight, and a bit of sadness. In that sense, Armageddon Time is a full meal."
Armageddon Time,His coming of age feels more like something out of the Marvel Universe than the childhood of a real living boy.
Armageddon Time,"Gray’s latest film, and his most personal to date, returns to the ’80s Queens milieu where he was raised, excavating from the filmmaker’s past a powerfully observed and deceptively wide-reaching chronicle of the American moral crisis."
Armageddon Time,"A great, solid, intimate effort."
Armageddon Time,Armageddon Time is emotionally honest storytelling.
Armageddon Time,"Am I bringing something to the table that keeps me from bonding with writer-director James Gray’s achingly personal – yet, to me, painfully pat – memory film? Or, to quote the Simpsons meme, is it the children who are wrong?"
Armageddon Time,"Sometimes it simplifies huge societal problems, but what makes it really great are the performances by Jeremy Strong, Anne Hathaway, and Anthony Hopkins."
Armageddon Time,The movie still uses its young Black character as a prop to process white guilt.
Armageddon Time,"Gray isn’t just well-intentioned... while the world around Paul may want to move on from Johnny, we can’t."
Armageddon Time,"Some of the individual moments are impactful or effective at evoking nostalgia. But, as they say, the whole is less than the sum of the parts."
Armageddon Time,"[Gray has] given his life story the tidy, well-meaning structure of a college admissions essay."
Armageddon Time,"Armageddon Time has a loose construction and a plot that follows natural beats rather than chasing grand, overly telegraphed moments. It comes back to themes of family, the promise of prosperity, and that precarious time in youth..."
Armageddon Time,What it lacks in explicit moral structure the film more than makes up for in historic sensibility.
Armageddon Time,"Looked at yet another way, this is a film about the temptation to sell out, clearly an ongoing practical issue for Gray, whose instincts are far from commercial but who has never given up hoping for a mainstream hit."
Armageddon Time,"The self-congratulatory, back-patting nature of this film is what makes it so insulting."
Armageddon Time,"It's a subtle movie, and Gray has cast it beautifully, including another great, valedictory performance by Hopkins."
Armageddon Time,"Writer-director James Gray tells a personal story about class, race and survival."
Armageddon Time,An alternately tender and candid glimpse of what it feels like to be told one thing while knowing the opposite is true deep in your bones.
Armageddon Time,"If there’s a longer, better-balanced cut of “Armageddon Time,” I’d like to see it. This one’s still worth seeing."
Armageddon Time,"The best intentions, even from such a fine filmmaker, don’t always translate to the best movies."
Armageddon Time,It’s an extremely well-made and cynical drama with terrific acting.
Armageddon Time,This is a story of adolescence that doesn't bask in the glow of nostalgia but asks tough questions of its characters and its audience.
Armageddon Time,"[Gray] has never made a film so deeply personal, so intentionally and uncomfortably autobiographical, as his wonderful new movie, Armageddon Time."
Armageddon Time,"“Armageddon Time” is a movie at cross purposes, blissfully clinging to a misunderstanding of the period it portrays and oblivious to how its central character is being perceived."
Armageddon Time,"Armageddon Time works because it hurts, not despite that hurt. The shame from behind the camera is hyperpresent."
Armageddon Time,"The troubling, ambivalently nostalgic Armageddon Time is the upshot of those aspirations—a movie that evokes and soothes its own pristinely guilty conscience."
Armageddon Time,"“Armageddon Time” is above all what it sets out to be: a story about growing up, and all the joy and pain that entails."
Armageddon Time,"The kind of movie you get when a talented filmmaker thinks back upon the painful moments of his childhood and then, after close reflection, decides to remake The 400 Blows."
Armageddon Time,"By letting the picture embody his failures — by turning Armageddon Time into a self-aware look at his own limitations — the director makes that necessary connection between then and now, between the characters onscreen and us watching."
Armageddon Time,"Armageddon Time, though a finely tuned picture of the past, is also strikingly modern and a painful reminder of how little we have progressed and how quickly people forget. In other words, it’s essential."
Armageddon Time,"Unlike most movies that draw on a director’s life, Armageddon Time is rarely rose-colored."
Armageddon Time,The film creates a vivid and evocative sense of its time and place.
Armageddon Time,"he film, in fact, is accidentally a metaphor for how little politically moderate white folks, in general, have actually reckoned with their part in the contemporary anti-Black rise of Trumpian rhetoric."
Armageddon Time,"Clotted with stumbling attempts to expiate guilt via easy ironies and stock moments of indignation, Gray's film is defined by flaccid political outrage, by a tidy didacticism about what the malevolent practices of four decades ago have wrought today."
Armageddon Time,"Although much of the action unfolds in a minor key, its impact on Paul is all too major; the adolescent mind, as Gray understands, can be a tool of magnification."
Armageddon Time,"""Gray unpacks his early influences with the kind of uncommonly sensitive and keen perception that he has employed throughout his body of work"""
Armageddon Time,"This is James Gray’s eighth feature and, in the end, its simplest. It may also be his best."
Armageddon Time,"Can you remember the first day of sixth grade? Would you even want to? James Gray, in the opening scene of “Armageddon Time,” his tender and lacerating new film, brings it all back with clammy precision."
Armageddon Time,A great family portrait that’s trying to be socially relevant but is painfully unaware.
Armageddon Time,A heartfelt and somber semi-autobiographical look backward that nonetheless resonates as a universal story about the necessity—and sometimes painful cost—of survival.
Armageddon Time,The film is an illustration of the transition from the ethical pliancy of youth to the moral discernment of adulthood.
Armageddon Time,"As a time capsule of the moment, both the film’s thematic concerns and its look are dead-on. The production design, by Happy Massee, is uncanny, perfectly recapturing the dingy, dismal, worn-out appearance of middle-class life in the Carter era."
Armageddon Time,"It’s a truly poignant, troubling, and ultimately brilliant work of memory and self-implication."
Armageddon Time,A child’s eye view of how small sins of daily life can add up to major wrongs.
Armageddon Time,"The performances in Armageddon Time are excellent. The actors playing the two boys are alive to each moment, as are the adults, and the terrific Hopkins shows how it is done, with kindness and compassion."
Armageddon Time,"The coming-of-age tale has been done to death on-screen, but James Gray has injected new life into it here – and new thoughtfulness."
Armageddon Time,"Gray’s films are always solidly crafted and elegantly shot, but he also has a weakness for ponderous pomposity. Armageddon Time is lighter and leaner than some of his past work, but not without its earnest, clunky moments."
Armageddon Time,"I came away from Armageddon Time wanting to cry, as if it had opened wounds of regret in me too."
Armageddon Time,"Gray lets his thesis gradually bloom in the minds of his audience, moving us slowly toward a shattering conclusion that also plays as a gentle but firm call to personal political action."
Armageddon Time,"A nuanced exploration of situational ethics tinged with guilt, it's a small, near-perfect New York story."
Armageddon Time,"Armageddon Time understands the past is a foreign country, and not one you can live in forever."
Armageddon Time,"Looking back at his childhood, his family, and his neighborhood, Gray lovingly conjures what he cherished while recognizing that it was inseparable from the epochal horrors that its seeming normalcy was fostering."
Armageddon Time,"There’s something a bit too polished and performative about the dialogue, though, and the treatment of a black character, Johnny (Jaylin Webb)... Yet Johnny feels less like a real character than a cipher in a white-guilt storyline."
Armageddon Time,"One of the least sentimental entries in what has typically been a seriously sentimental genre of film, and one of the least nostalgic examples of a form that is almost by definition nostalgic."
Armageddon Time,The strikingly guileless performance that Gray gets out of Repeta is a triumph.
Armageddon Time,"An unvarnished family snapshot that traces the seeds from which the artist evolved and the tough lessons about life’s unfairness that helped shape his character, this is a refreshingly understated drama whose gentleness makes it all the more bittersweet."
Armageddon Time,"It doesn’t evade every trap or trapping of convention, but its tenderness of touch is matched by a remarkable toughness of mind."
Armageddon Time,"Gray has given us tough, sinewy and memorable New York movies in the past such as The Yards and We Own the Night, but this is weighed down with a sentimental and self-regarding staginess."
Armageddon Time,"It’s a skillful, exacting, beguiling movie."
Armageddon Time,"While Gray’s nostalgia may be morally instructive to a certain degree, the desiccated little gem of a movie that he’s whittled down from it isn’t much convinced about the possibility of pure-hearted kindness."
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,"[Bridges'] handsome, effortless charisma is on full beam as Preston Tucker, an American car entrepreneur during the 1940s."
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,Tucker works well enough on a purely emotional level to become a resonant film. And its naivety is in certain ways its strength.
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,"Tucker's style, like the film commemorating him, is that of a story-board artist turning life into instant wish-fulfilment. All posture, no depth: all good looks nothing behind them."
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,The result is psychologically fascinating but deeply disheartening as the latest chapter of Coppola's cinematic career.
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,Coppola tells this story with grand exuberance without masking the personal and historical tragedies that it involves.
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,A revealing and heartfelt biopic.
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,"The true story of a great American visionary who was thwarted, if not destroyed, by the established order, Tucker represents the sunniest imaginable telling of an at least partly tragic episode in recent history."
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,"The result is a film consistent narratively, confident stylistically and abounce with the quaint quality that animated both the hero and his times, something we used to call pep."
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,Francis Coppola's stylish and heartfelt tribute to the innovative automobile designer Preston Thomas Tucker turns out to be one of his most personal and successful movies.
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,"Mr. Coppola has done things this fancily before, but never with so clear and moving a sense of purpose."
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,Nobody does it better: Pristine images glide past you with the just-waxed brilliance of an assembly line of new Tuckers.
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,"If we're offered a movie named Tucker: The Man and His Dream, we leave feeling cheated if we only get the dream."
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,"Tucker came up with a classic, but poor Coppola has turned a great American tragedy into a gas-guzzling human comedy."
Lifemark,A true story about adoption that is almost too good to be true. Its all positive and no negative. If only.
Lifemark,Undeniably moving... with universally capable performances creating a range of sympathetic characters.
Lifemark,Newcomer Ruggero beautifully captures so many little moments here and Lifemark has a myriad of little moments.
Lifemark,"An entertaining, deeply moving celebration of adoption."
Lifemark,"A genuinely moving, inspirational and captivating journey with just the right balance of humor and heart."
Mississippi Masala,"Mira Nair’s sophomore feature, Mississippi Masala, lives at the intersection of disparate cultures."
Mississippi Masala,"Mississippi Masala appears to have been produced on a modest (by Hollywood standards) budget, but it is a big movie in terms of talent, geography and concerns."
Mississippi Masala,"The script, though it clips along with a wicked capering wit, is forever explaining itself; the comedy is a broad grin filled with sitcom retreads... Delivered with enormous good humor and affection, all of this works."
Mississippi Masala,"It moves in fits and starts and it isn't obsessively tidy about each and every loose end, but in its sweet, slightly melancholy, gently humorous way, it fills the screen with the freshest, most winning love story we've seen in ages."
Mississippi Masala,"Though Mississippi Masala is, by a conservative estimate, the 4,000th film to appropriate Romeo and Juliet as a metaphor for racial intolerance, Nair's film feels amazingly fresh and lively."
Mississippi Masala,"Despite the awkwardness of much of the staging, and the unevenness of the script, the movie does give you a sense of real people living real lives."
Mississippi Masala,What makes this such a filling and memorable masala is that [director Mira Nair] stirs in so many misunderstandings with so little malice.
Mississippi Masala,"An interesting if poorly constructed and self-contradicting drama, directed with something less than assurance, but given some appeal by the honesty of its performances."
Mississippi Masala,"Washington is savvy and attractive as the enterprising carpet cleaner destined for a brighter future. Choudhury is a discovery as the Americanized Mina, who calls herself a kind of masala. Together, they carry the film smoothly and agreeably."
Mississippi Masala,"The most powerful films are those magic carpet rides that transport us to places we’ve never been, introduce us to cultures we’ve never known... I have in mind Mira Nair's extraordinary Mississippi Masala."
Mississippi Masala,The movie is both wonderfully tender and wryly funny. Nair perfectly captures the contrasting lifestyles... She treats all her characters with such playful affection and obvious sensitivity that they are hard to resist
Mississippi Masala,"When Denzel Washington nibbles Sarita Choudhury's mouth in Mississippi Masala, the theater is so quiet you can hear the Raisinets settling in their boxes and butter trickling down the popcorn. Has there ever been a sexier screen couple?"
Mississippi Masala,"The result of this second collaboration between Nair and Taraporevala is good-natured entertainment, a contrast with the spurious romanticism and voyeuristic fatalism of their first, Salaam Bombay."
Mississippi Masala,"Rich in detail and rigorously even-handed in its treatment of all of its characters, except for the group of young Indian men that gathers around Mina's spurned suitor, Mississippi Masala offers an affecting depiction of their journeys of the heart."
Mississippi Masala,"With its rich panoply of characters and its acute observations, Mississippi Masala manages to be about much, much more than Demetrius and Mina."
Mississippi Masala,"This smart, appealing movie about displaced people and severed memories is firmly rooted in Nair's generous appreciation of her all too human characters."
Mississippi Masala,An interracial social comedy that explores new ground but unfortunately with old cliches.
Mississippi Masala,"Mira Nair's Mississippi Masala is a piquant dish all its own, a love story with a twist, a look at displaced people, a charming, poignant blend of comedy and drama."
Mississippi Masala,"Mississippi Masala is full of good will, but it's not preachy and its story of romance in an ethnic broth is fascinating when it's working right."
Mississippi Masala,"A movie that is not only accessible and earthy, but also innocent and wise."
Mississippi Masala,
Mississippi Masala,"An utterly infectious romance between an African American and an Indian African emigre, this seductively funny film measures the pull of roots against the tug of heartstrings."
Mississippi Masala,Surprisingly funny and cheerful at times.
Mississippi Masala,"It takes love to bring all these elements together into harmony, and Nair makes it look easy even when it's most difficult for her characters."
Mississippi Masala,"It may be longwinded here and there, but Mississippi Masala jumps with life."
Gigi & Nate,The courtroom drama completely undoes the whole thing. It's just completely contrived.
Gigi & Nate,"It has a pleasant but not particularly striking look; endearing performances from a familiar cast of esteemed veterans and earnest newcomers, and a storyline designed to provide a few initial chuckles."
Gigi & Nate,"Unfortunately, the final stretch of the movie becomes a riff on God’s Not Dead, though PETA, er, “AFAB,” becomes its cartoon courtroom villain instead of liberal academia."
Gigi & Nate,"It's a call to action with no banner behind which to rally, sanitized to the point of being anodyne."
Gigi & Nate,"Rather than offer insight into the difficult choices facing disabled people, “Gigi & Nate” opts for mawkish wish fulfillment, undercutting the film’s powerful emotional core."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,Steven Spielberg’s E. T The Extra-Terrestrial envelops you in the way that his Close Encounters of the Third Kind did. It’s a dream of a movie -- a bliss-out.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,Don't be intimidated by those long lines. E.T. is worth standing in line for. Steven Spielberg's story is the essence of fairy-tale simplicity.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"This is a real movie, with all those elements that have proved sure-fire through history; Laughter, tears, involvement, thrills, wonderment. Steven Spielberg also adds a message: Human beings and spacelings should learn to co-exist."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,Spielberg has crafted with warmth and humor a simple fantasy that works so superbly on so many levels that it will surely attract masses of moviegoers from all demographics.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Steven Spielberg's E. T., The Extra-Terrestrial is the best cinematic fairy tale since The Wizard of Oz."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,E.T. ...comes to a beleaguered industry like a gift from the gods. Not only does it get bums on seats but it encourages the kind of shared enjoyment that suggests the cinema still has something unique to offer.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,The marvel of this extraordinary movie is that it captures for even the most jaded grownup that pleasurable state of innocence and awe that only children are fortunate enough to experience.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Spielberg would seem to be groping towards a virtual theology of space, space as Heaven, offering solace to a world which has foolishly renounced its traditional God but still aches to extend its own spiritual frontiers."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"E.T. is essentially a spiritual autobiography, a portrait of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination. It comes out disarmingly funny, spontaneous, bighearted."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Captivating, endearingly optimistic and magical at times, Steven Spielberg's fantasy about a stranded alien from outer space protected by three kids until it can arrange for passage home is certain to capture the imagination of the world's youth."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"What's perhaps most amazing about E.T., what distinguishes it from many of the other fantasy films of its era, is its ability to put an audience under a spell of childlike wonderment without infantilizing it."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Spielberg's direction and Melissa Mathison's script never lose sight of the realistic, low center of gravity world of childhood, in which such marvelous adventures happen every day."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,It holds up beautifully.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,My heart still soars as Elliott goes airborne and pedals across the face of an impossibly full harvest moon on his bike.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"It is a hugely enjoyable romp, but compellingly spiked throughout with little stabs of anxiety."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,The film is full of funny scenes and magical moments.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,It is the kind of film that young people are going to want to see again immediately after they've seen it.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Unchecked goodness has its price, after all, and childhood wonder wouldn't be nearly as sweet if it didn't fade. That may explain the film's appeal. It trapped that feeling, and its sense of possibility, in amber -- then, now, and for any time."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"An appealing film this new one is, with some charm, some glee in the childrens' triumphs, some share in their friendship with E.T."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"More than the work of any other filmmaker, Spielberg's output seems uniquely designed to induce in me this queasy false-memory syndrome."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"On inherent merit, the movie would not warrant such a highly publicized re-release, but this is one of those films that transcends what's on the screen."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,A contemporary classic.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Although conclusively demonstrating Spielberg's preeminence as the popular artist of his time, E.T. finally seems a less impressive film than Close Encounters."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,What E.T. does so well is to capture that moment in life when childhood seems to be slipping away.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,[It] may become a children's classic of the space age.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,A film that connects so beautifully to our sense of wonder and joy.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Like Peter Pan, who also took children flying until it was time for them to grow up, E.T. represents the wonder of childhood, of a time that we must all leave behind."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,A devastating rebuke to anyone who has presumed to patronise this great film-maker.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Twenty years after smashing box-office records, Steven Spielberg's gentle sci-fi fable returns to screens as vital and accomplished as ever."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,The tenderness of the piece is still intact.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Viewers returning to it, as well as those discovering it, will find it an enduring children's film -- but one whose impact has diminished with the passage of time."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"If we approach with sympathy and curiosity, we will be rewarded with same. And our souls, not to mention our bicycles, will soar to the heavens."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,A sophisticatedly sappy masterpiece.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"This is an outstanding family movie, with themes of loyalty, friendship, trust, and caring. One of the most purely magical scenes in the history of film is when Elliott's bicycle lifts off up into the sky."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"We have yet to recover from his revelation: that there is nothing more real than sitting in your own back yard -- waiting for the unreal to come down, take a handful of candy, and fly you to the moon."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,A magical film.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"A sublime modern fairy tale, a movie that, if anything, looks subtler, darker, and more intimate now than it did when originally released."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,A masterpiece that deserves to be seen and appreciated on a big screen.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,Steven Spielberg's masterful film has lost none of its power to sweep the viewer away in the most 'excellent' late-20th century boy's adventure one could hope for.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"Sweet, heartwarming, adventuresome, and joyful."
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,It remains a classic.
ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,Spielberg left it open for all of us. That's the sign of a great filmmaker: He only explains what he has to explain.
The Outfit,The Outfit tells a great story – sure to keep viewers enthralled – but there are elements of its execution that fall by the wayside.
The Outfit,It is a pleasure to see a good yarn played out in such professional fashion. Just try not to think of the awful pun in the title.
The Outfit,"It’s chiefly a work of cinematic craft, not art -- though that’s not necessarily a derogatory label, since there’s so much pleasure to be found in its construction."
The Outfit,Rylance can hang another immaculate screen performance in the wardrobe.
The Outfit,"Rylance’s heart may belong to the theatre, but the camera adores him. The old faker... he’s in a class of his own."
The Outfit,"The Outfit follows a pattern set by countless gangster flicks of the past, but its freshness is in the intelligence and surprise of the script. Like a well-made suit, it’s not old-fashioned — it’s classic."
The Outfit,Compelling performances make it worth sticking through one quite silly climactic beat.
The Outfit,"Deutch is charming but isn’t given enough to work with, and Rylance offers a strong performance but is countered by uneven acting from the ensemble cast and an overall lack of development for most of the characters."
The Outfit,It’s fitting that Mark Rylance plays a Savile Row tailor in The Outfit as the film itself feels tailor-made to the British actor.
The Outfit,"Rylance is the actor as clockmaker, working with ratchets and cogs and somehow creating something bigger than life."
The Outfit,"A cheap, talky and stagy chamber drama that thinks it is clever.... Rylance's fine underplaying cannot save ""The Outfit"" from being second-rate."
The Outfit,The pleasures of writer-director Graham Moore’s intimate little crime thriller The Outfit sneak up on you with the same glissando shiver that you feel when you slip on a silk-lined coat.
The Outfit,"The Outfit is a movie cut and tailored to Mark Rylance’s quivering intonations, to his pursed lips and fragile presence."
The Outfit,"Movies rarely come as chic as The Outfit, a thrifty, continually unpredictable whodunit, fashioned with the same meticulousness found in the bones of a deceptively simple suit."
The Outfit,"The movie lags when Rylance isn't the focus but, fortunately, he is at center stage for most of ""The Outfit."""
The Outfit,“The Outfit” would be a splendid thing if limited to Rylance’s voiceover and long lingering shots of him working with fabrics.
The Outfit,"Even those of us who go wild for twists may wonder, as the narrative enters yet another chicane, if we are getting too much of a good thing. To be kept guessing is not quite the same as being thrilled."
The Outfit,"The Outfit is almost comically insistent that it be rewarded for its cleverness. During the films one eye-catching montage, the editing cuts again and again to shots of scissors as though it simply must demand applause."
The Outfit,A watchable mafia movie — shocking!
The Outfit,"""The Outfit"" isn't flashy or attention-grabbing, but it's an assuming, subtle surprise, the kind that never goes out of style."
The Outfit,"An expertly crafted puzzle box of a movie...Rylance, as always, is a master of the smallest gesture and change of expression."
The Outfit,"What we have here is something new assembled, painstakingly and piece by piece, out of old cloth, yet burnished to such a fine throwback sheen that it creates a self-contained time warp."
The Outfit,"The screenplay from Moore and Jonathan McClain is priceless, helping make “Outfit” one of the best releases I’ve seen yet this year."
The Outfit,"Rylance anchors it all, creating a character with unexpected layers, like a suit with an elegant silk lining you didn’t realize was there."
The Outfit,"Mostly, the movie seems like it was concocted by a couple of cinephiles who wanted to play with genre for genre’s sake. And why not?"
The Outfit,"While there’s no denying that the well-tailored Outfit starts slowly, once it finally gets going the mystery is fun to work out."
The Outfit,"Rylance keeps us guessing...a taut, beautifully-acted period piece."
The Outfit,"A twisty, blood-soaked chamber piece, a retro gangster noir as meticulously crafted as a fine custom suit."
The Outfit,It’s a fine showcase for its star and his talents.
The Outfit,"For the most part, the twists and turns keep the viewer engaged, the puzzle pieces fit together on a second viewing, and Rylance never ceases to mesmerize."
The Outfit,"The Outfit is a dapper, twist-filled crime story that relies more on dialogue than gunplay to move the action."
The Outfit,"The biggest surprise of “The Outfit” is also the happiest, which is that this small-scale, modestly budgeted feature film is one of the best acted movies of the season."
The Outfit,"The Outfit is not, strictly speaking, a movie about magic. Yet the gangland thriller pulls off a number of nifty tricks, with first-time director Graham Moore playing his hand with equal parts sleight and might."
The Outfit,"Filled with twists and reversals that, for the most part, are motivated by character not plot, The Outfit is a nifty little period thriller that provides a showcase role for the always-amazing Mark Rylance."
The Outfit,"Rylance is what makes “The Outfit” tick. He’s as expert at his craft as Leonard is at his, and his clientele is a lot less dangerous."
The Outfit,"From a technical standpoint, everything in The Outfit connects from one moment to the next, because theres a sense of logic to its progression. However, the bigger emotional picture that unfolds is a head-scratcher"
The Outfit,"Given its sartorially suggestive title, it’s apt that The Outfit is an elegant and stylish thriller."
The Outfit,"Rylance’s heart may belong to the theatre, but the camera adores him. The old faker... he’s in a class of his own."
The Outfit,"A refreshingly grown-up, original work, as pleasingly assembled as a good crossword puzzle."
The Outfit,Top-tier cinema.
The Outfit,"The film cheerfully bluffs and misdirects, but crucially it never cheats. It’s also anchored by two richly enjoyable performances."
The Outfit,"Moore cites Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rope” as an inspiration, but he seems not to have absorbed the Master’s definition of suspense, which puts trust in giving more information to the audience, not less."
The Outfit,"Sure, Graham Moore's directorial debut is stylish, but it's the way he lets the performances shine that impresses most about this well-made gangster picture."
The Outfit,"It’s an entertaining, fairly overwrought piece, a little tightly buttoned."
The Hours and Times,"The Hours and Times is as fresh, as vital, and as creative as any independent American feature to have appeared this year..."
The Hours and Times,Its extreme low-budget charms elude this spectator.
The Hours and Times,[Writer/director Christopher Munch] is greatly aided by Ian Hart's deft impersonation of the cocky yet sensitive Lennon and David Angus's considered portrayal of the tortured Epstein.
The Hours and Times,"The film delivers intellectual archeology, a rediscovery of states of mind and mood that shook the world; Münch's calm, contemplative, and quietly astonished direction vibrates with the historic excitement of the moment."
The Hours and Times,"A sharp, concise, evocative film about friendship, about its limitations and the recognition of those limitations."
The Hours and Times,
The Killing Floor,ERROR
Another Day of Life,"These characters look and sound and feel, more so than in many other animated films, fake. That's not generally the effect one looks for in telling a true story."
Another Day of Life,"""Another Day of Life"" [is] not just another war-is-hell story, but a powerfully thorny war-journalism-is-hell tale too."
Another Day of Life,An engrossing film in which form and function can be intriguingly opposed.
Another Day of Life,"A punchy, spectacular hagiographic hybrid."
The Garden,It lacks the distanced humour and style of some of the recent big hits of Icelandic cinema... but it makes up for it with a big heart.
Rosie,"While quite a few films have grappled with this idea, few recent ones have done so with as much heart or charm as this one by Canadian writer-director Gail Maurice."
Rosie,"I thought we were at a point where trans actors were at least cast in the poorly written trans parts, but I guess not!"
Grass,At this point it feels as though Hong can create a lovely composition or reach psychological insights offhandedly-the films successfully translate his carefree filmmaking process into narrative form.
Grass,"""Grass,"" true to its title, is small, sharp and bladelike."
Grass,One of the best expressions/variations on Hong's usual formula.
Grass,"This movie, like most of Hong's others, doesn't pass judgment on its largely passive protagonist. In fact, it suggests that observing the people that pass through one's sight and hearing is an entirely valid mode of living."
Grass,"By the end of the film, Areum is forced to reckon with the very people she so casually, even callously inserted into her writing."
Grass,"Hong turns the café and its narrow alley into a graveyard of emotion. With a disturbing simplicity, he maps a passing vortex of pain onto bare and banal places and, in the process, rescues it from oblivion."
Grass,"With Grass, Hong has taken the familiar elements of his work and exploded them, fashioning a kind of lonely cinematic cubism."
Grass,"The black-and-white ""Grass"" is a deceptively potent entry in the canon, a thimbleful of purest, concentrated Hong-brand soju."
Grass,"An exquisite hangout movie whose probing, sardonic approach to character and conversation treads familiar terrain for the increasingly prolific Korean director."
Grass,"Much less consistently enjoyable than many Hong films twice its length, Grass compensates for its dramatic slackness and deviant sobriety by honing in on the ideas that its director's work often skirts around."
Grass,"The choice to shoot in unspectacular black and white and in uninterrupted long takes (par for Hong's course) brands it as mainly for the fan club, whose ranks seem to grow with every new addition."
The Aspern Papers,This isn't very good but for the Redgrave family... They just eat the scenery.
The Aspern Papers,[A] peculiar and ineffectual film.
The Aspern Papers,"The drama features opulent production design (the floral arrangements!), providing ample eye candy for fans of period movies."
The Aspern Papers,"Landais has made a version of ""Aspern"" that is too often uncertain and unconvincing despite the good work of his female stars."
The Aspern Papers,More lifeless than its namesake's long-dead body.
The Aspern Papers,"Richardson is strong enough to survive inept direction, but the rest of the performances range from bad to wincingly bad, including the distractingly modern types on the edges."
The Aspern Papers,It's like a Merchant-Ivory film - on Quaaludes.
The Aspern Papers,"The film is smart, literary, nuanced, slightly stagy - and pedigreed to within an inch of its life. It practically reeks of dusty, yellowed pages and engraved-leather bookbinding."
The Aspern Papers,"""The Aspern Papers,"" brief as it is, needed more of a lightness of touch; if you weigh down melodrama too much, it dies."
The Aspern Papers,"Landais certainly brought little cinematic verve to ""The Aspern Papers,"" telling the story largely in turgid literary voiceover lifted directly from the original source material."
The Aspern Papers,The words of Henry James have never sounded as leaden and preposterous as they do in Julien Landais's The Aspern Papers.
The Aspern Papers,"Much of this movie, to be honest, is conducted on the level of amateur dramatics, in particular as we stray beyond the bounds of the palazzo."
Olivia,ERROR
Prescience,"James Helsing's trite ""Prescience"" only warrants notoriety for turning a baffling screenplay into a poorly acted melodrama via a misused cast composed of rising talents and respected veterans such as Oscar-nominee Eric Roberts."
Giant Little Ones,"Finally, a film about teenage sexuality and its inherent fluidity that has something authentic and intelligent to say."
Giant Little Ones,"There's something enormously refreshing about the openness and honesty found in Keith Behrman's coming-of-age film, Giant Little Ones."
Giant Little Ones,[An] emotionally honest and heartfelt look at figuring out one's path through the difficult journey of adolescence.
Giant Little Ones,"Behrman has crafted a classic high school tale of outsiders finding themselves ... The images are sumptuously saturated and gorgeously crafted, and the soundtrack thrums and whines with anxiety and racing pulse."
Giant Little Ones,"Despite its lapses into self-consciousness, the movie presents us with a set of characters that we end up believing and caring about - not tremendously, but enough to keep watching to see how they all turn out."
Giant Little Ones,"The plot may take an unexpected path, but that's not enough to make Franky and Ballas's story compelling."
Giant Little Ones,What starts as a rather typical indie drama about a young man inching his way out of the closet ultimately proves to be a far more complex and rewarding ode to the fluidity of identity.
Giant Little Ones,The sheer amount of issues shoved in here is overpowering.
Giant Little Ones,"Where many coming-of-age films build their stories around the discovery of a fixed selfhood, ""Giant Little Ones"" succeeds when it chooses to treat youthful identity as open to shift with accumulated experience."
Giant Little Ones,"Aside from an awkward, confusing and pointless title that spells box-office trouble, Giant Little Ones is a very fine, immaculate and nuanced film indeed."
Giant Little Ones,"Keith Behrman's film comprehends the malleable, often inscrutable nature of desire."
Giant Little Ones,"Polished and lively, with just enough fresh angles to avoid feeling like a rote recycling of gay cinema tropes."
Giant Little Ones,"The film belongs to Wiggins, who brings an openness and sincerity to Franky's struggles that help suggest to what extent his character's specific story has elements that everybody will be able to relate to."
Giant Little Ones,[A] tender but untimid drama.
Midnight Diner,"""Midnight Diner"" has its faults, particularly regarding its duration and intense sentimentalism on occasion, but emerges as a very easy to watch, quite entertaining spectacle"
Midnight Diner,"Though the release itself is bare bones, there's delicious, nutrient-rich content in the film itself, making for a robust meal all on its own."
Out of Blue,I just wasn't clear what it was I was supposed to be taking away from anything I had just watched.
Out of Blue,"Viewers who like their mysteries to be solved, rather than merely mused upon, should prepare for bewilderment."
Out of Blue,"When a film-maker aims this high, how can one do anything but watch in wonder?"
Out of Blue,There are moments when Carol Morley's fourth feature offers a fair approximation of early David Lynch or mid-period Nic Roeg
Out of Blue,"Even if some of the smart-arse tricks don't come off, Out of Blue is always stylish and often compelling."
Out of Blue,"A chaotic swirl of universes and ideas with an excellent lead performance from Clarkson, however the central narrative gets lost in the furious mix."
Out of Blue,"Unfortunately, its odd mix of hard-boiled noir and cod-metaphysical waffle comes together in a way that defies you to take any of it seriously..."
Out of Blue,Out of Blue is a folly so lame and loopy that you want to help it across the road: possibly into a taxi to a care home.
Out of Blue,"Ambitious is often critic speak for a movie that's interesting, challenging and borderline unwatchable. Thus 'ambitious' is the kindest way to describe this latest boundary-pushing work from Carol Morley."
Out of Blue,Morley's fussy neo-noir reveals an incapability to build a bridge between supernatural imagination and convincing drama.
Out of Blue,"A twisted car wreckage, but without the element of voyeuristic fascination."
Out of Blue,"For one of America's most unique and photogenic locales, the Crescent City is as wasted as Clarkson-so boring to look at that the whole movie could have just as well been shot in Toledo, Ohio."
Out of Blue,"A detached motion picture, and it's hard to get away with that clinical approach and still adhere to a thriller format."
Out of Blue,"[Out of the Blue] tries too hard to both be a part of -- and comment on -- the genre of crime stories, and does not succeed at either."
Out of Blue,"Carol Morley's film wants to blow our minds, but it succeeds only at rousing our boredom."
Out of Blue,"It's bold and occasionally maddening, but there's not much other genre fare like it right now."
Out of Blue,"""Out of Blue"" doesn't strike out only as an adaptation. What it offers on its own is tepid and predictable."
Out of Blue,"The plodding ""Out of Blue"" isn't out of ideas - just out of gas."
Out of Blue,Carol Morley's murder mystery is a mood piece that alternates between naffness and transcendence.
Out of Blue,"If ""Out of Blue"" is meant sincerely, why is so little care given to psychology or plot? And if it's meant as pastiche, why isn't it more fun?"
Out of Blue,"Part police procedural, part supernatural thriller, part lesson in metaphysics and all neo-noir, Carol Morley's Out of Blue never gels into a convincing whole."
Out of Blue,"Out of Blue is one of those films you're not sure if you really enjoyed viewing, but you're immensely glad that it exists, cheered to know the film industry still has room for maverick, boundary-smudging work like this."
Out of Blue,"Morley sustains a vibe of low-key Lynchian weirdness throughout, enough to keep your mind from wandering even as the investigation meanders this way and that."
Out of Blue,"The atmosphere is repeatedly dismantled by cross-purpose dialogue which simply doesn't ring true, however huskily Clarkson whispers it."
Out of Blue,"There's a light, Lynchian touch throughout. The film can be hilarious while dealing with dark emotions, thanks especially to wonderful performances from Clarkson and Jackie Weaver."
Out of Blue,"A flawed film, but a valuable one."
The Sound of Silence,"It is stunted and meandering, barely filling out its 85 minutes."
The Sound of Silence,"...""The Sound of Silence"" is a modest, contemplative study of ideas that itself exemplifies those ideas in its design, not least its sound design; it embodies a conceptual rumination."
The Sound of Silence,"Lucian is a man with a theory, desperate to extrapolate from what he knows is true to what it might imply, and if you've ever known such a man, you will likely appreciate Sarsgaard's performance"
The Sound of Silence,"This is based on a short film and I wonder if it would have worked better as a short film, because it does feel very stretched out and elongated beyond what the central premise can sustain."
The Sound of Silence,"[An] ambitious, tonally intriguing comedic drama..."
The Sound of Silence,"There are moments in which the movie seems to veer decidedly toward self-knowing comedy but never quite gets there, and then turns so sad as to be tragic... The lead performances, though, are compelling - both intelligent and vulnerable."
The Sound of Silence,"Sarsgaard finds an almost sensual serenity in the everyday gravity of his assuredness, even as the film gingerly weaves both a pensive quality and a deadpan wit."
The Sound of Silence,"""The Sound of Silence,"" anchored by a superbly modulated performance by the always intriguing Peter Sarsgaard, is fascinating, original and, yes, deeply resonant."
The Sound of Silence,"Art is supposed to help us see the world in novel ways. The Sound of Silence, in its quietly exhilarating manner, may make us hear it differently, too."
The Sound of Silence,"""The Sound of Silence"" wants to be heard, but, in the end, doesn't have much to say."
The Sound of Silence,A wonderful high concept is compromised for another story of lonely people learning to connect.
The Sound of Silence,"An exciting idea and a cast with the flair to convey it go to waste in this overplotted, underdeveloped science-fiction mood piece."
The Sound of Silence,"""The Sound of Silence"" is a deeply silly movie that takes itself incredibly seriously, and believe it or not, that's its great pleasure."
The Sound of Silence,"There are clearly some fascinating ideas embedded in [The Sound of Silence], but the whole production is too numbingly flat."
The Sound of Silence,"This film is quiet in more ways than one, drawing viewers in but compelling them to hang on every word."
The Sound of Silence,Deftly balances the cerebral with the soulful in a story of transfixing originality.
Donnybrook,"There are no winners here, only losers."
Donnybrook,I couldn't get any of what I just saw out of my head for hours after I had viewed it.
Donnybrook,I like my sleaze 100% pure; this movie is covered in Sleaze-Whiz.
Donnybrook,"Tim Sutton's artfully directed but self-important downer of a movie that's meant to be some sort of Grand Statement about life among dispossessed whites in rural, Midwestern America."
Donnybrook,"Anchored by a quartet of fierce performances, ""Donnybrook"" is an intense, visceral tone poem, a rumination on money and drugs and bloodshed as a means of making ends meet in the heartland of modern America."
Donnybrook,"""Donnybrook"" is a movie about, among other things, bare-knuckle fighting, but it's the viewers who will feel beaten down."
Donnybrook,A pointless exercise in gratuitous violence that imagines itself deep because it's got an opera-heavy score.
Donnybrook,"While the movie develops a gripping and purposeful arc as it builds to the final act confrontation, the humorless aura has a tendency to stifle its characters' humanity by drowning them in desperation."
Donnybrook,"Has that morose aesthetic and grim determination, but the plot and pacing are too aimless to sustain much interest, even for these relatively brisk 101 minutes."
Donnybrook,Tim Sutton's screen adaptation frequently blunders over the line separating evocative exaggeration from noxious bullshit.
Donnybrook,The film knots several strands of new-millennium despair into something that very nearly approximates greatness in its first half.
Donnybrook,"A unique, twisted, and not altogether unwelcome thriller."
Donnybrook,"The film exudes a grungy, B-movie ethos in keeping with its scrappy, resourceful characters."
Donnybrook,"Sutton's skill is making you care for these characters and keeping you rooting for them to find some redemption. But then he punishes you for such hopes, all to get across a blunt and hollow message."
Donnybrook,"The apocalyptic vision of the heartland created by Sutton and his cast (based on the novel by Frank Bill) is impressively convincing, even if the themes are often overstated and the film itself is very hard to watch."
Donnybrook,"If Sutton's aim is to give these people a voice, he has not only failed, but he has gone further and reduced them to inchoate caricatures."
Donnybrook,"It's a pulpy slab of exploitation masquerading as an important treatise on the struggles faced by the working class in rural America, thumping us in the face with its shallow viewpoint until we beg for mercy. Or at least the credits."
Donnybrook,"A repellent mixture of Malick-like dreaminess, Scorsese-esque brutality and the lurid shock/schlock of William Faulkner in Sanctuary mode."
Donnybrook,Dark [and] bruise-inducingly poetic...
Pasolini,"Just as he did with 2018's At Eternity's Gate, in which he embodied the artist Vincent van Gogh, [Willem] Dafoe brilliantly captures the essence and a more-than-reasonable resemblance to the real figures."
Pasolini,"It may be only one man's version of what many have speculated about... but in its clear-eyed grittiness, it's also a tribute from a filmmaker for whom the night's temptations were ripe and its dangers legion."
Pasolini,"Ferrara... straining toward the sublime, stumbles into vulgarity."
Pasolini,Reluctantly takes its place in a cinema of admonition that turns human lives lived against oppressive opposition into simplistic warnings against having sex on the beach. The man deserves better.
Pasolini,"Ferrara's Pasolini is sincere, even scholarly; as a film, it feels too stilted and reverent to capture much of that sense of danger."
Pasolini,One of the most intuitive and mysterious movie biographies made in a while.
Pasolini,"Part hero worship, part true-crime tragedy and completely of a piece with its creator's obsessions over the spiritual and the sordid."
Pasolini,"As exquisitely detailed and historically accurate as many of its scenes are, ""Pasolini"" is less concerned with the realistic reconstruction of the past than with communicating a mood in the present."
Pasolini,"If the blend of English and Italian dialogue seems slightly awkward, it doesn't disrupt the film's ease: a matter-of-factness which resists idolizing Pasolini in favor of an open-minded rendering of everyday humanity."
Pasolini,"Pasolini may not be the film we were promised, but it turns out to be something better: a thought-provoking - if not quite masterful - cinematic portrait of an artist whose visionary oeuvre remains poorly understood."
Pasolini,"The heady cocktail of politics, religion, blowjobs and murder is catnip for Ferrara, although anyone not versed in the controversies of Salò may leave the film none the wiser."
Pasolini,"Despite Ferrara's insistence that he and his key crew are devout students of Pasolini's cinema, he applies the lessons of this apprenticeship freely, without mimicry."
Pasolini,The film isn't so much a conventional narrative as an elegy and a parable.
Pasolini,"The decision to base so much of the film on existing text - the interviews, the manuscript, the screenplay - lends a deadening dryness to much of Pasolini."
Pasolini,Abel Ferrara tries (and fails) to solve the riddle of who killed the famed Italian director.
Pasolini,"You come in expecting portraiture, but Ferrara gives you Cubist still life."
Pasolini,"Ferrara creates a palimpsest of ideas, though I found those imaginary recreations of finite dramatic interest."
Pasolini,"Working in the most white elephantine of genres, Ferrara has produced one of its few termitic entries."
Pasolini,"In trying to spell out what was going on his Pasolini's mind, he does his idol's talents a disservice. Ferrara tells us so much more about Pasolini -the filmmaker, the artist, the public figure- when he leaves it to us to imagine what the man thought."
Pasolini,A flawed film of unvarnished integrity.
Pasolini,It's profane and it's precious and it glows like the moon.
Pasolini,"The result borders on incoherence, providing few startling insights for aficionados and minimal illumination for the uninitiated."
Pasolini,"Presumably, to understand Pasolini is to excavate him from the twisted miasma Ferrara has created in his image."
White Snake,ERROR
Yardie,Fairly routine... I wish the ethnic aspects of this film had come to the fore more and that they had played down the druggie stuff that we had already seen a million times.
Yardie,"The acting is decent, the cinematography is well executed, and the music is on point, but the delivery and the tone are completely mismatched."
Yardie,"What sets Elba's movie apart is the distinctive world he creates, in the rhythm of the music, in the raw, gritty poetry of the language, and in the powerful mythology it mines."
Yardie,"While ""Yardie"" hits familiar beats, viewers get the sense they're on Elba's turf."
Yardie,The film is saddled with an extraneous narration that mercilessly distracts the viewer.
Yardie,"Yardie is a sprawling drug-world saga, but whatever narrative flaws it has are helped out by an infectious selection of dub-heavy reggae tracks and an authentically gritty sense of period and place."
Yardie,Headley's book is a hard nugget crackling with urgency. This feels like soft-boiled pulp.
Yardie,"Elba brings care to the film's performances, period look and musical elements. But the freeze frames, needless voice-over bits and stalled narrative momentum undercut the picture's potential power and uniqueness."
Yardie,"Elba grew up in Hackney, and also worked as a D.J., and his familiarity with the community is visible in the movie's evocation of a tumultuous world suffused with lowlife scheming and thumping tunes."
Yardie,Elba has a nice day job acting and he ought to stick with it.
Yardie,The chances taken by Yardie compensate for the weakness resulting from a derivative story.
Yardie,"There wouldn't be a long list of ""ifs,"" had Yardie been stripped down to its core."
Yardie,"The film's tendency to break the ""show, don't tell"" directive becomes especially irksome in its homestretch."
Yardie,"This is a film about the pressures and demands of making another country your own. Too often, however, the viewer will feel as befuddled as the protagonist."
Yardie,Obviously Idris Elba is very well-versed in the music and the style and the cultures that this story is dealing with and he evokes them in such a way that you feel that you are really there.
Yardie,"If [Elba's] first film often looks good and always sounds great, beneath its skin it is short of heart and soul."
Yardie,"The performances aren't bad (Ameen's charisma eclipses the expositional dialogue), but the stakes feel low and the characters gangster-movie generic."
Yardie,"Right from the outset, Elba gives his film a mythic dimension."
Yardie,"Cosy clichés such as these undercut the rawness of the material - which is a shame, because Elba's visual sense and handling of actors suggest a strong future behind the camera. At least it shows he's human."
Yardie,"So, a disappointment, sadly, but I did not fall to my knees and bellow 'Noooooooo.' Just wasn't in the mood."
Yardie,"Enjoyable, but so deeply conventional that it feels a little played out."
Yardie,By the end the movie's wall-to-wall carpeting is dead bodies and the underfelt is a disintegrating script.
Yardie,"Ahead, its own distinctive, rewarding path; on all other sides, several hundred yards of crime-movie cliche. At most of these junctures, Elba makes the right choice."
Yardie,"Neither a luridly enjoyable piece of Scarface-style pulp or a nuanced genre subversion, Idris Elba's directorial debut is a fitfully entertaining 1980s gangster thriller."
Yardie,"As it stands, Yardie seldom amounts to anything more than a collection of vaguely related scenes, simultaneously both too muddled and too straightforward to have any resonance beyond the moment at hand."
Yardie,"""Yardie"" has the right look, the right sound and the right moves to play with the bigger boys of its genre; like its young, scrappy but naive hero, however, there's not quite enough power behind its posturing."
Yardie,It's a pedestrian effort that could have used a serious hit of Elba's dangerous charisma onscreen.
Yardie,"Throughout the messy experience of ""Yardie,"" [Idris] Elba's interest in storytelling gets ahead of his lacking visual instincts. Though I'm curious to see what story he tells next, Elba proves to not yet have an original voice behind the camera."
Yardie,"It's never quite clear what is driving D, or if he has some sort of master plan. Despite copious amount of voiceover narration, it's unclear what his intentions are."
Yardie,"Although Elba stretches the narrative to its limits, this is a nicely-shot, -cast and -told period story of black Britain - when so few exist - with a geniality that cuts through some of its bleaker moments."
Saint Judy,"This film is itself an important piece of advocacy for women everywhere, and for empathy, too."
Saint Judy,"Despite the faint whiff of sanctimoniousness that occasionally emanates from this well-meaning motion picture, Saint Judy generally holds its own as a solid courtroom drama."
Saint Judy,"Is at its strongest when focusing on the experiences of Judy's clients, and watching the emotional weight on their shoulders slide off as they open up to her."
Saint Judy,The early glimmers of something soulful and sobering - rooted in investigative details and detention center realities - ultimately give way to the tired mechanics of give-it-all uplift.
Saint Judy,Wood's achievement deserves to be celebrated. The issue is that Hanish's film never misses an opportunity to make its saga as corny as possible...
Saint Judy,"While the viewer can intuit that Hanish has a strong clear story to tell, the director too often tricks things up with noncredible flashbacks, fatty getting-from-one-place-to-another montages scored to anthemic pop and other extraneous matter."
Saint Judy,"The film, directed by Sean Hanish, sometimes turns didactic, but it benefits from the efforts of an exceptional cast; their work deserves to be seen."
Ophelia,ERROR
Charlie Says,"Charlie Says makes a strong case for an even grayer area: That perhaps these women can be victims and guilty of horrific, unpardonable crimes. It's an unsettling thought. But at least, unlike the exaltation of Ted Bundy's abundant charm, it's a new one."
Charlie Says,"Harron's film is at its most thoughtful, and its most useful, in moments where it presents itself as an exploration of young women in thrall to a charismatic, deeply egotistical leader who thrives on their willing submission."
Charlie Says,"If nothing else, Charlie Says puts Van Houten in the center of her own story. Look at her game, girl."
Charlie Says,"While well-intentioned and thoughtful, ""Charlie Says"" is too ambivalent and too safe to deliver much in the way of original insight."
Charlie Says,A fascinating and feminist exploration of Manson's first victims: the girls themselves.
Charlie Says,"You want to see how a person could surrender herself - her self - to something so diabolical, which demands a higher level of insanity than the filmmakers can muster."
Charlie Says,"There's just not enough to Charlie Says, an ambitious, but uneven drama about the oft-sensationalized 'Manson Girls.'"
Charlie Says,"Suffering through what Charlie says again, without purpose, is unfair punishment, if you ask me."
Charlie Says,Charlie Says is a difficult movie that strips away the Hollywood veneer to a well-worn true crime story.
Charlie Says,"The movie's depiction of these lost flower children, and what rendered them susceptible to Manson's brainwashing, is frustratingly shapeless and shallow."
Charlie Says,"In her powerful and deeply affecting ""Charlie Says,"" Mary Harron revisits the Manson cult in a dramatization largely told from the perspective of his female followers."
Charlie Says,Harron does a good job of conveying both the late-'60s period and the surreal surroundings of the Spahn Ranch where Manson and his followers made their home.
Charlie Says,"Despite taking a different angle to the much-discussed crimes, Charlie Says still feels shallow in its approach."
Charlie Says,"The film appears to be striving for humanistic understanding, but the end result is far too jumbled to have the proper impact."
Charlie Says,"The Manson scenes, which take up roughly half of the running time, do not or cannot suggest to us why these young women fell under Manson's power."
Charlie Says,"Harron chooses not to focus on the victims who were killed, but how their savage murders impacted the women who committed them."
Charlie Says,What makes Charlie Says so original is its perspective and its willingness to depict the banality and absurdity of life with Manson rather than simply to portray him as the quintessence of evil.
Charlie Says,"So ambivalent as to be frustratingly gun-shy about truly asserting a point of view, or adding anything meaningful to the already thriving cottage industry of Manson-adjacent storytelling."
Charlie Says,"It has none of the brilliance and insight of Emma Cline's 2016 novel The Girls, on roughly the same subject."
Charlie Says,"Charlie Says is absorbing if only intermittently effective, but it has the distinction of bringing a female gaze to arguably the most notorious crime spree in American history."
Charlie Says,"This is an innovative, occasionally provocative, often frustrating film, but one whose perspectives on guilt and victimhood offer a new angle on a notorious case."
Charlie Says,"Matt Smith is miscast in the crucial role of Manson, failing to summon the cult leader's manic energy or make us understand just how it was that he had so many under his thrall."
Vita & Virginia,"Much of the dialogue in Vita and Virginia is scooped directly from love letters exchanged between the writers - which, unfortunately, makes for a rather cumbersome screenplay."
Vita & Virginia,"It's not as bold as that trio, but it's elevated by some adroit dialogue and knockout performances from Gemma Arterton as Vita Sackville-West, and Elizabeth Debicki as Virginia Woolf."
Vita & Virginia,Maybe dramatizing their correspondence would have worked if it had been paired with convincing dialogue.
Vita & Virginia,"This peek into a famous love story makes the audience a participant in the affair, inspiring questions of perspective and truth in love and art, where the only truth worth anything is one deeply felt."
Vita & Virginia,"It's never a good sign for your rulebreaking romance when the occasional bits of dialogue between wayward wives and their sad husbands is more human, more feeling, and more emotionally intelligible than that between the lesbian lovers."
Vita & Virginia,"The movie's editing undermines both lead performances. Scenes end abruptly, or seem set up for a moment that never arrives."
Vita & Virginia,"Based on what we see here, the work was almost absurdly greater than the inspiration."
Vita & Virginia,"It hardly makes for scintillating cinema, even given the whiff of scandalousness with which Button and Atkins lay out the stages of Vita and Virginia's relationship."
Vita & Virginia,"There were moments in director Chanya Button's Vita & Virginia where I felt like she had made this delicate, painfully mesmeric drama just for me."
Vita & Virginia,Vita & Virginia wastes the talents of four people-its two subjects and the two women that play them.
Vita & Virginia,The two women don't really seem to know each other very well.
Vita & Virginia,"Because Arterton portrays Vita with an almost adolescent superficiality, her fixation on Virginia never feels like more than a conquest, or a rung to be climbed on the literary ladder."
Vita & Virginia,"""Vita & Virginia"" takes a passionate, real-life affair between two enormously gifted writers and proceeds to throttle the life out of it."
Vita & Virginia,"That it builds to the writing and publication of Woolf's landmark novel Orlando, whose title character Sackville-West inspired, only makes one wish to be watching Sally Potter's 1992 adaptation of Orlando (starring Tilda Swinton) instead."
Vita & Virginia,The film frequently falls back on the stately demeanor of countless other historical biopics and period pieces.
Vita & Virginia,"Debicki is wonderful as Woolf, a wry and solemn observer, but the rest of the film is all too literal."
Vita & Virginia,"But if you're going to re-enact the Fall and liberation from Eden, for the world's female and lesbian communities, you've got to have a garden or gardens to do it in."
Vita & Virginia,"Yet much good will is squandered by some mood-killing touches, most prominently a score that can only be described as candle shop electronica."
Vita & Virginia,"Quite irritating...not entirely successful, but it does have things in it that work, not least the performances."
Vita & Virginia,"It is a good, honest performance and, for all that the movie itself is brittle, self-conscious and perhaps a little absurd at times, there is a vehement, urgent idealism."
Vita & Virginia,Torn between brave experiment and on-after-Lovejoy heritage telly.
Vita & Virginia,"The makers of this biographical romance clearly adore Virginia Woolf and want viewers to engage with her personality, sexuality and lightning-bright words."
Vita & Virginia,"The two writers narrowly skirt scandal, unlocking each other's potential to scale new professional heights. But the film seems to skirt along with them, hanging on every word like a groupie too overawed to interject."
Vita & Virginia,Only existing fans of Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West are likely to be drawn to this stiff recounting of the writers' 1920s Sapphic affair.
Vita & Virginia,Don't come here for a stylised period drama that glosses over either the class gap or her mental health.
Vita & Virginia,The film never delves beneath its surfaces.
Vita & Virginia,This is a stranger and more intriguing film than it really has a right to be...
Vita & Virginia,"Button has hit on a topic that will draw in both literary and LGBTQ audiences, but it lacks the electricity to go the extra mile theatrically."
Vita & Virginia,"In this mannered literary period piece, the story of the love affair between Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West is too hampered by tonal and pacing issues to ever ignite."
Styx,[A] thought-provoking moral drama.
Styx,"It's a vital, highly intelligent movie that is both a first-class thriller and a biting commentary on our current world."
Styx,Styx is a gripping sea adventure that mixes thrills and spills with thoughtfulness and compassion.
Styx,"The outcome is bleak. Powerful, potent cinema."
Styx,Fischer's second feature is so minimalist it makes JC Chandor man-in-a-boat survival drama All is Lost look like Waterworld.
Styx,"Fischer literalises the turbulence we're now navigating, and asks some stern questions of our moral compasses."
Styx,"Yes, it's kind of a white saviour drama, but this intense moral story about racial injustice is a gripping watch. Sparely told and stylishly shot, it lists a bit in the final act but is undoubtedly worth the journey."
Styx,"It is a nautical yarn about the haves and the have-nots, using the microcosm of the Asa Grey to explore social, economic and political dilemmas that are the neglected responsibility of us all."
Styx,"""Styx"" mixes the inherent danger of man versus nature with man's callous indifference to man, managing to be both eternal and contemporary in its concerns."
Styx,"Wolff is never less than mesmerizing in this role, which demands a performance that is, at times, more physical than emotive."
Styx,"Its dizzying strength is as a visceral journey, a detour from the privileged freedom represented by a horizon to the tragic limbo of displacement, an ocean that's both a confinement and an abyss."
Styx,"Perverse as it may sound, the film isn't punishing or stretched out enough to make everything feel equal, and the lack of adrenaline can sometimes feel like an affectation unto itself."
Styx,"A taut moral thriller, ""Styx"" is a story of what happens when self-reliance runs into other people's desperation."
Styx,The film is a penetrating an indictment of the bureaucratic obstacles placed in front of refugees.
Styx,"The existential elements of this very contemporary rumination are obvious. Bringing the plight of refugees to the forefront is noble. It's enough to make this excursion, which piques fear, sadness and anger, haunting."
Styx,"This is ""All Is Lost"" with a spinning moral compass and a topical dimension that proves even more gripping than its brilliantly achieved visceral action."
Styx,"Carrying practically the entire film, Wolff is never less than remarkable in a demanding role that's 80 percent silence and 20 percent English-language dialogue."
Cliffs of Freedom,"The dialogue is often stiff, the action and plotting unlikely, making the romance hard to swallow."
Ms. Purple,"It may look and feel like Hou-Hsiao Hsien (Millenium Mambo) and sound like Wong Kar-Wai (In the Mood for Love), but writer-director Justin Chon (Gook) doesn't have what it takes to do all that paraphrasing and still make the film his own."
Ms. Purple,"The empowerment trajectory of ""Ms. Purple..."" will surprise no one."
Ms. Purple,Carey and Kasie have suppressed most outward signs of emotion. But Chu and Lee show the emotion roiling beneath the surface...
Ms. Purple,"A moody, downbeat drama soaked in color and saturated with sadness."
Ms. Purple,"Together, these various shades of misery swirl together to create a beautiful portrait of a fractured but resilient family."
Ms. Purple,"Each layer is so beautifully, subtly explored, you can get lost in the characters' emotions or just be swept away by Ante Cheng's cinematography, which graciously soaks in the street and neons light of Los Angeles."
Ms. Purple,"Even with an ostensibly more delicate scenario than a community literally ablaze, Chon's eagerness to treat emotions like ready-made fires gets in the way of the intended weight and textured beauty of his drama."
Ms. Purple,Subtlety dissipates as Justin Chon's film grasps for something louder and more obvious.
Ms. Purple,"Chon creates a layered aural and visual landscape for the characters, who are simultaneously grieving the past and the future, their present an almost uncanny hallucinatory state."
Ms. Purple,"Chon's newest film is a tribute to familial responsibility, told from a female perspective."
Ms. Purple,"It's often the moments in between Chon's loudest notes that make the best impression in ""Ms. Purple,"" a striking character study on the responsibilities of family, and the importance of sticking around."
Ms. Purple,"It's a ripe topic Chon clearly feels deeply, rendered in beautiful cinematography and delicate storytelling."
Ms. Purple,There's enough substance here to reward the patient in this tale of two disparately isolated siblings reuniting during their father's last weeks in L.A.'s Koreatown.
Ms. Purple,Dwells quietly in the limbo of those waiting for a loved one to die.
High Strung: Free Dance,"This follow-up to 2016's ""High Strung"" has its visual dazzle and performance highs but the story and characters are just too fake, chaste and grit-free to take seriously."
High Strung: Free Dance,"The glossy fakeness is a signal to the audience that every single thing about these stories will stand in abject defiance of reality, and it's best just to accept them at face value."
High Strung: Free Dance,Bland even by this genre's low standards.
The Lumber Baron,"Ambition overtakes ways and means in ""The Lumber Baron,"" a fusty and unpersuasive if well-intentioned drama about the American logging industry circa 1910 that has ""Masterpiece Theatre"" aims but far more pedestrian results."
The Image Book,"Another infuriatingly incomprehensible Godard movie made up entirely out of archival images... Having said that, some of the imagery is powerful."
The Image Book,"Is The Image Book really a film? Godard himself has re-engineered it as an art installation, to be shown on a TV."
The Image Book,"A rumination on art, politics, history, and mankind's eternal folly disguised as a cinematic collage. It's plotless but it has shape; random but with purpose."
The Image Book,"""The Image Book"" is an 85-minute cinematic brainstorm, a swirling, dazzling, maddening frenzy of disconnected sights and sounds that have been compiled and arranged according to a rhythmic and rhetorical logic that only its maker can fully divine."
The Image Book,"""The Image Book"" lives and breathes cinema; the cutting and sound games (up and down and all around) remain arresting and instinctive and inspired."
The Image Book,"Concerned neither with telling stories nor even making rational sense, Godard aims straight for lyrical beauty, and he almost always hits his target."
The Image Book,"...gloriously obscure and brutally unpretty, yet lucid and even gorgeous all the same."
The Image Book,"The film has the intimacy of a personal postcard sharing memories of deceased friends, favourite films and political touchstones."
The Image Book,"Another free-associative cinematic meditation on language, the image, and extinction, by a master of the form."
The Image Book,"After all this time, we are not much closer to understanding Godard, but he seems to understand us all too well."
The Image Book,Jean-Luc Godard's The Image Book is as dense and alienating as anything the iconoclastic director has made this century.
The Image Book,"Jean-Luc Godard is a lion in winter. He fairly roars in The Image Book, his new film that serves as a visual essay about life on planet Earth."
The Image Book,"I found it haunting, thrilling and confounding in equal measure."
The Image Book,"Centering film history on the Second World War, the Holocaust, the atomic bomb, and the Cold War, Godard pursues an alternative history that relates cinematic failings to political ones."
The Image Book,The Image Book contemplates what possibilities of salvation and beauty might still reside in our horrific and uncertain world.
The Image Book,A compelling collage that refuses to fit into any predetermined pigeonhole.
The Image Book,"One thing is clear. No one, but no one, makes films like this."
The Image Book,"For all my initial bafflement, The Image Book continued to haunt me. Maybe that's all Godard wanted."
The Image Book,Le Livre d'Image is a film that derails itself constantly and self-consciously.
The Image Book,"It's not really ""about"" anything (that's soooooo bourgeois! ""About""? I mean, really!)."
The Image Book,It has moments of unlikely beauty.
The Image Book,"Sadly, you can still see here tiny flashes of the sensibility that made Godard great, once."
The Image Book,"Even more than his recent output, it is composed entirely of jarring clips, sourced from a kaleidoscopic array of films, news and online media, that have had the colour and contrast turned up until they often blur into abstraction."
The Image Book,"Disjointed and direct, exhilarating and soporific, cerebral and squirrelly: The Image Book is lots of contradictory things at once."
The Image Book,The Image Book ends with another display of madness that would be a more than appropriate sendoff for the French New Wave figurehead's restless career.
The Image Book,"What's the rubric, one has to wonder, for evaluating a movie like this? Perhaps it's better to submit to its form than agonize over its content."
The Image Book,"As you watch ""The Image Book,"" it conjures a totemic darkness that can't be shaken off."
The Image Book,"As with his previous idiosyncratic, often inscrutable late works, this will be seen only by a highly select audience of dedicated Godardians, and genuinely liked by just a fraction of those; one can essentially name them."
The Image Book,"Image Book is a work that reprises many of Jean-Luc Godard's familiar ideas, but with an unexpected urgency and visceral strangeness."
The Image Book,"In the process of pulling movies apart, The Image Book forms a closing chapter in a work that Godard began with Breathless in 1960."
The Image Book,"To encounter a film this intransigently confrontational by an artist who shows no sign of softening will be a nightmare for many, but yes, for many a privilege and a pleasure."
Babylon (1980),ERROR
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","Ruben Brandt, Collector is an intricately plotted, hyper-stylized piece of eye candy with art - the love of, the need for, the inability to escape from - at its wildly beating heart."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","A satisfying heist movie, animated or live-action, requires more selectivity and less clutter than this one. The movie dashes by door after door, but it lacks the key."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector",It merits being counted as one of the decade's best and most wildly original animated triumphs.
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","If you love art, ""Ruben Brandt, Collector"" is a non-stop visual fest, from the first frame till the last."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector",Writer-director Milorad Krstic pads out what probably should have been a fascinating animated short - about an art therapist who is himself tormented by nightmares featuring characters from famous paintings - with drawn-out bits of ludicrous action.
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","This is Krstic's first feature and it's obvious that he has visual flair to spare. If he can only find a story worthy of it, he'd have a real work of film art."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","Ruben's story may be as oddly illogical as any of his nightmares, but the animation here is a dreamy delight."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","Something this larky should be swifter and more compact; instead, ""Ruben Brandt, Collector"" feels like a sneakily pretentious pastiche, and not much else."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","If you have an eye for this sort of thing, and a passing knowledge of famous art, the film, if nothing else, will provide a fun opportunity to pick out a pageant of imagery from some of the great treasures of art history."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector",It's a triumph of style over substance. But what style!
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","The film is lighthearted but not frivolous, and the animation -- a mix of computer-generated and hand-drawn -- is so innovative and fun it's always a pleasure to look at the screen."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","The visual influences are found in museums, with characters and backgrounds lifted from Manet and Picasso, but the storytelling style is straight out of Mario Bava, with a cinematic philosophy more akin to Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian pastiches."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector",Milorad Krstic's ingenious animated film about a psychologist fighting characters from 13 famous paintings is a transporting cinematic marvel.
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","What's so grand about Ruben Brandt isn't its story or the characters, which are both abstractions. It's the animation-the detailed artwork, so dense that it warrants repeat viewings."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","The story never fully lives up to the ideas, and the ideas themselves are fuzzy and scattered."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","The film doesn't apply the necessary touch and precision to balance its sleek, chromed parts into a revving whole."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","An acrobatic, larkish globetrotting adventure about paintings and psychotherapy that defies easy categorization save inclusion on any adult animation fan's must-see list."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector",An animated joyride.
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","This is a film which fizzes with originality, one which works both as a pacey thriller and a playfully surreal intellectual exercise."
"Ruben Brandt, Collector","While Krstić is especially good at providing noir atmosphere (jazzy, smoke-filled dives, ominous shadows, and references to Mike Hammer films), he positively excels at high-octane action."
Mary Magdalene,Neither Rooney Mara (as Mary) nor Joaquin Phoenix (as Jesus) are especially compelling.
Mary Magdalene,It is so slow and so boring.
Mary Magdalene,"This is a noble effort, but ultimately Mary Magdalene isn't much less of a mystery than she was at the start of the journey."
Mary Magdalene,"Mary Magdalene presents a feminist defense of Mary and more shading to Jesus's other apostles, but its particular method of world-building does little in terms of impact."
Mary Magdalene,"It's a well-meaning, good-looking effort - but those elements don't necessarily make for good watching. One needs to be in the mood for this sort of thing."
Mary Magdalene,There's exactly one image in the film that reflects a modicum of directorial imagination...
Mary Magdalene,"Ironically, in its enthusiasm for its exceptional heroine, the film actually undermines Jesus' challenge to the patriarchal norms of his day."
Mary Magdalene,"Mary Magdalene is in many ways an act of love, an effort to tell its story both freshly and honestly, with fidelity to Scripture."
Mary Magdalene,[A]n imperfect but affecting vision of New Testament times.
Mary Magdalene,Mary Magdalene moved me in a way that no previous film about Christianity ever has.
Mary Magdalene,"Johann Johannsson's comically overbearing score is just interesting enough to justify the entire project, but Mary Magdalene is ultimately an unnecessary cinematic resurrection."
Mary Magdalene,"If the son of God dedicated his life to building a kingdom of peace and justice for the poor and oppressed, could it be that he was a thumping bore while doing it?"
Mary Magdalene,"One reason why the movie seems so emotionally hollow is because the relationship between Mary and Jesus, which is supposed to be at the heart of the story, isn't developed in a meaningful fashion."
Mary Magdalene,"""Mary Magdalene"" dutifully telegraphs the nobility and compassion of its title character while remaining noncommittal about everything else in its path."
Mary Magdalene,"t I appreciate the aim of Mary Magdalene, and the ways it reimagines a familiar story with modern implications, even when it falls flat."
Mary Magdalene,"The film boldly retells this familiar tale from a female perspective, but offers no insight into Mary apart from a superficial ""You goeth, girl!"""
Mary Magdalene,"As the plot mechanically moves through Jesus's greatest hits, the narrative focuses less and less on Mary Magdalene until her life feels completely beside the point."
Mary Magdalene,The far-reaching message of love and compassion even under the worst circumstances never grows old. Even with a fresh retelling that reflects the times and humankind's current condition.
Mary Magdalene,"It's a cheerless, ideologically driven movie."
Mary Magdalene,"Without scaring any horses, Davis ... gets the familiar tale across with lucidity and some grace"
Mary Magdalene,"It goes straight for the forehead: it is a brow-furrower and a temple-rubber, best mulled over at a remove."
Mary Magdalene,"A tasteful RE lesson that rushes to paint Mary's inner strength and moral goodness, but forgets to shade in the contours of her characterisation."
Mary Magdalene,There's no doubt that Davis has taken some major risks with Mary Magdalene and while they don't all pay off in completely satisfactory ways there are still enough qualities to make this intriguing piece of revisionism constantly watchable.
Mary Magdalene,"Jesus is a stoner Messiah, with his woozy delivery and Kris Kristofferson beard."
Mary Magdalene,Davis (best known for 2016's Lion) has pulled off the miracle of turning The Greatest Story Ever Told into One of the Dullest Stories Ever Screened.
Mary Magdalene,"What's missing here is any sense whatsoever of dramatic conflict. The film's formal beauty notwithstanding, this is a torpid affair."
Mary Magdalene,"Although a rather elegant and serene interpretation of an eternal story, this film has little new or interesting to offer either to believers or non-believers."
Mary Magdalene,"An interesting new take on a very well-known tale and a praiseworthy act of revisionism, but one which doesn't ultimately deliver on its early promise."
Mary Magdalene,"It ripples with interesting ideas, but the overall effect is glassy and inert, with Rooney Mara's Mary an oddly elusive presence in the film that carries her name."
Mary Magdalene,"Mary Magdalene only snaps into focus as narrative when we get to Jerusalem, chiefly because it gives these kids something to physically rail against - moneylenders, Judas kisses, Romans, and all. It's a little on the late side, though."
Mary Magdalene,"Other than to show that a woman called Mary who wasn't a prostitute was involved in the final weeks of the Jesus story, I have no idea what the filmmakers wanted for this project. I'm pretty sure they didn't achieve it."
Mary Magdalene,"Sets itself a bold task: to rescue Mary Magdalene from an age-old tradition of patriarchal condescension and misinterpretation. And yet it winds up embracing a solemn, softly-spoken and slow-moving Christian piety of its own."
Mary Magdalene,"Hushed, deliberate and realised with considerable care and beauty, the resulting film has its heart entirely in the right place; its pulse, unfortunately, is far harder to locate."
Mary Magdalene,"[A] clearly well-intentioned, attractive, wistful-to-the-point-of-inertia film ..."
Mary Magdalene,"An astonishing performance from Rooney Mara elevates this telling of a familiar story, as does Garth Davis's nuance and distinct focus. A wonderful film."
Palau the Movie,In reality this man's ideas... [are] not very clear. [Full review in Spanish]
Rafiki,I really like this film and I think [director] Wanuri Kahiu is definitely someone to watch.
Rafiki,It's a film that is rushing with energy and life.
Rafiki,"But to merely describe what happens in ""Rafiki"" would be to overlook its transporting sense of place, its striking visual pleasures and its credible and moving performances."
Rafiki,"For its formal simplicity and directness, ""Rafiki"" is a small revelation, not least because it marks the breakthrough of a filmmaker of such exhilarating, cheerfully courageous vision."
Rafiki,"While the tone of Rafiki is simple and direct, director Kahiu demonstrates a delicate touch."
Rafiki,A lyrical ode to finding a kindred spirit amidst an uncaring majority.
Rafiki,"Rafiki hardly breaks new narrative ground, but Kahiu's fluid direction and wholly empathetic performances by Mugatsia and Munyiva make the movie special."
Rafiki,"The film is sharp at rendering the hesitancy of their flirtation, as well as the forces - parental expectations, religion, an ever-watchful gossip - arrayed against them."
Rafiki,"From its opening frames, Rafiki is bursting with life."
Rafiki,The film's slotting of two African women into a familiar romantic structure represents a radical and important upending of contemporary Kenyan sexual mores.
Rafiki,Kahiu's film reinforces that being who you are and loving in spite of the opinions of others is still a revolutionary act.
Rafiki,It's hard to escape the feeling that the film is basically an extended public service announcement; Kahiu has few discernible goals apart from drawing attention to an important subject.
Rafiki,The story may be familiar - same-gender couple struggle with mean oldies - but it buzzes with such juice and joy that it will surely gain a cult following.
Rafiki,"Wanuri Kahiu's Rafiki, based on the short story ""Jambula Tree"" by Monica Arac de Nyeko, is a vibrant, pulsing piece of work, keying off the joy of young love and unexpected discovery."
Rafiki,That Kenya is late to the women-coming-out film party is a function of its social and political structure; it doesn't lessen the courage and freshness of Kahui's filmmaking.
Rafiki,The story's simplicity and directness are a big part of its charm.
Rafiki,If the film is uneven-with such an exuberant beginning and disappointingly rote climax-that may simply be because [director Wanuri] Kahiu wanted to communicate as many truths of her home country as she could.
Rafiki,"For Kahiu, this sophomore feature should secure enough exposure to enable further, more ambitious vehicles for her direct, Afropop-infused style."
Rafiki,[A] poignant but slender drama...
Rafiki,"Muatsia, with her tough gaze and somber asides, maintains a credibility that rescues the movie from cliché. By telling an old story of impossible love, Rafiki renews its purpose."
Rafiki,"This is a story that may have been told before, sure, but never in this context before. That alone seems worth celebrating."
Trial by Fire,Trial by Fire... forces Willingham through a kind of poetic transformation.
Trial by Fire,"Powerful stuff, but unpowerfully told, in part because the energies in ""Trial by Fire"" are split between proving Todd Willingham's innocence and building an argument against the death penalty no matter what the verdict."
Trial by Fire,The movie is painstakingly well made and murderously hard to sit through.
Trial by Fire,"There's that masterpiece of a micro-performance by Jeff Perry, in that single scene. That alone is worth the price of admission."
Trial by Fire,"O'Connell and Dern, meanwhile, find the common ground in their characters that keeps ""Trial by Fire"" simmering."
Trial by Fire,"The film plods at points, trudging along, and there are a few misguided narrative 'devices' tacked on."
Trial by Fire,Trial by Fire loses its way by failing to trust the power of its compelling facts to convince you on their own.
Trial by Fire,"[I]t's hard not to feel that even at a little over two hours, there's a rushed, assembly-line quality to how ""Trial by Fire"" wants to work our emotions."
Trial by Fire,"It's a haunting, heartbreaking story, told by a movie that never quite makes a case for itself to exist."
Trial by Fire,The movie's raw facts are sufficient to rouse viewer indignation. But the material arguably calls for a more proactively provocative approach.
Trial by Fire,Certain aspects of the story... are addressed so superficially that it would have been more efficient just to show them being crossed off of a checklist.
Trial by Fire,"""Trial by Fire"" is at its best when attacking the prosecution's bad science. Unfortunately, the film would rather try, and fail, to tug on the audience's heartstrings"
Trial by Fire,"Wisely, Zwick front-loads the film with its most pronounced asset: O'Connell. That strategy succeeds at partially dissuading attention from its other, much less praiseworthy features, namely hackneyed lines invoking run-of-the-mill melodrama."
Trial by Fire,"""Trial by Fire"" never really stirs up much outrage or sadness, although it tries. It's a good story, not a great one, that generates fire, but no heat."
Trial by Fire,"O'Connell, no stranger to playing spiky, brutish characters, eases into the role, equally adept at portraying the rough and the smooth, and he helps add grit to what can often be staid film-making."
Trial by Fire,"Even though ""Trial by Fire"" is less than a masterpiece, it still came as a gut punch that forced me to examine my own complicated feelings on the issue. In short, it taught me something, and that was a surprise."
Trial by Fire,"""Trial by Fire"" is not a feel-good movie. It's a feel-bad movie. Yet somehow, if you go in expecting that, you might enjoy it in a weird way."
Trial by Fire,"Ed Zwick uses a popular artistic to stake out a moral and political stance that, if not radical, is at least forceful."
Trial by Fire,"Without flair or fresh insights into its chosen subject, this just seems like spinning more wheels about on oft-discussed subject."
Trial by Fire,"What Zwick lacks in artistry, he makes up for in anger, and Trial by Fire burns with a righteous fury that spreads right off the screen."
War and Peace,"In focusing on how audiovisual materials are scrutinised elsewhere, War and Peace neglects to interrogate its own relationship to the images of war."
Hampstead,"Here Keaton reprises the role of the slightly kooky, klutzy, and lovable gal next door in this toasty crumpet of a film, set around London's scenic Hampstead Heath."
Hampstead,"More often, though, Hopkins and writer Robert Festinger pile up the commonplaces hoping they'll result in actual characters."
Hampstead,"The quasi-credible friendship that develops between Emily and Harry gives way to a less plausible romance. But the winning, sympathetic Keaton and an enjoyably puckish Gleeson largely sell the contrived setup."
Hampstead,It's a pleasant rattle of a film that makes fine use of its likable leads - Keaton's oddly regal klutziness matches well against Gleeson's gruff moral rectitude - and an appealing setting.
Hampstead,"Eccentricity triumphs in the end, leaving Annie's ghost fluttering happily evermore."
Hampstead,Just look at that lovely still of [Keaton and Gleeson] sitting idyllically on Hampstead Heath. Now wave it in front of your eyes for an hour or two. That experience will be richer than anything in Joel Hopkins's underpowered screen filler.
Hampstead,"Keaton and Gleeson are sweet together (I like the sweaty, studenty-vibe they create in Emma's attic). It's also nice to see London's housing crisis being discussed."
Hampstead,This ghastly faux-mance pays lip service to the housing crisis but has as much genuine empathy as someone whose main concern about rising rents is whether it might push up the price of nannies.
Hampstead,More proof that Richard Curtis's style of comedy-drama is very difficult to imitate.
Hampstead,"A wildly simplistic ""autumnal romance."""
Hampstead,"Gleeson is a fine actor in most circumstances, but here the material is so thin he's given nothing to work with, or against, as there are no decent jokes, and there's almost no drama."
Hampstead,"100 minutes of flimsy whimsy, calling on Keaton ... to dispense her clucking, ditsy bewilderment, school of Annie Hall, while Gleeson does bluff and crotchety charm, school of Brendan Gleeson."
Hampstead,The drawback here is the utter lack of pungency. This film doesn't smell real at all.
Hampstead,Don't come looking for social realism. This is an unapologetically fluffy film.
Hampstead,"Keaton's terrific, and it's sweet and airy and so unhurried you really feel like you've had a nice afternoon in the long grasses and cool breezes on the edge of the city. You wouldn't want to live there, though."
Hampstead,"This slight, modestly sweet and mildly charming affair squarely aimed at the older cinemagoer is just the bill for those seniors' matinées where the ticket comes with a cuppa and a biscuit."
Hampstead,We're just supposed to accept that Diane Keaton - Diane Keaton! - would happily settle for a man she literally finds in a bush.
Hampstead,"These yin and yang performers complement each other nicely, like tangy rhubarb and sweet, thick custard. It's just a shame that the vehicle which has brought them together is so insipid."
Hampstead,"Diane Keaton and Brendan Gleeson aren't an obvious match; despite their combined lovability, this slender romcom doesn't prove otherwise."
Hampstead,Watching it is akin to witnessing Maggie Smith's The Van slowly rear-end Richard Curtis's Notting Hill: a cringing slow-mo car crash best viewed between your hands.
Peterloo,"It's talky, but a lot of the talk is quite interesting and passionate. It's sort of like being in a really good town hall meeting."
Peterloo,There's an emotional distance to Peterloo that often makes it seem stagey.
Peterloo,"Still, it is a powerful, important part of anger-fueled history and is worth seeing."
Peterloo,"As the overlong (2 1/2 hours plus) film drags on you get the numbing feeling that Loach would have done it all much better, more economically and with more passion."
Peterloo,"Crucial to Leigh's very British notion of democracy is a commitment to showing people as they really are -- or as he sees them, in all their knobbly imperfections. Crucial, too, is the fact that even an epic like Peterloo remains a film without heroes."
Peterloo,"Once again, the director proves himself to be a master of basic human conflict, on whatever scale is necessary."
Peterloo,"A bit of ruthlessness in editing - a good hour or so - would certainly make ""Peterloo"" a better film."
Peterloo,"There's a universality to the issues ""Peterloo"" explores. And, once you get through all the speechmaking, it provides an emotional kick that will resonate anywhere."
Peterloo,There's a clumsy didacticism that might work better if he didn't run through dozens of superficially sketched characters.
Peterloo,"""Peterloo"" takes its time, giving us little by way of explanation and grounding but creating, in its bits and pieces, a vivid and coherent world."
Peterloo,"Leigh's bland images are solely illustrative, and his loving depiction of workers might embarrass a Soviet-era propagandist; he seems so stirred by their speeches that he forgets to craft characters..."
Peterloo,"The film looks fantastic, as Leigh and cinematographer Dick Pope advance a painterly aesthetic even richer than the one they created in Mr. Turner."
Peterloo,Dialogue explaining what the Corn Laws are or the meaning of habeas corpus is presumably not the product of long periods of intense rehearsal.
Peterloo,I learned things while sitting in the audience and that's a claim I rarely make about any motion picture circa 2019.
Peterloo,"[R]ather than a fine-tuned excavation, ""Peterloo"" unfurls like a grandiose pageant, in which Leigh's usual gifts for illuminating human behavior at its most intimate and universal are sacrificed to expository set pieces and long, windy speeches."
Peterloo,"Does every landowner and politician have to be either comically inept as if out of a Monty Python piece or so villainous that all that's missing is a Snidely Whiplash mustache? Does every working-class person have to have this pained, oppressed look?"
Peterloo,"Mike Leigh, in his latest film Peterloo, painstakingly recaptures this enormous event in a historical epic that quietly revitalizes the genre."
Peterloo,"What [Leigh] is digging at, under a remarkably convincing recreation of 1819 England and the nascent reform movement of early 19th-century Britain, is both the brutality and the self-righteousness exhibited by the haves, when the have-nots ask for more."
Peterloo,"Peterloois a difficult film to cozy up to, especially when you know the fate of the central characters. It succeeds more as a historical treatise than as a piece of entertainment."
Peterloo,"Difficult to experience though its finale may be, ""Peterloo"" very much gives off the sense that watching is essential."
Peterloo,"It's yet another well-acted and brilliantly staged addition to the filmmaker's oeuvre, which has always sought to understand Britain, then and now."
Peterloo,"This is historical re-creation on an epic scale. Yet it's a down-to-earth epic, with a density of detail that's stirring in its humanity and frightening in its clarity about miscalculations on both sides."
Peterloo,"Even if you've never heard of the Peterloo Massacre, this picture-beautifully staged and shot, with a you-are-there urgency-will reward your patience."
Peterloo,[A] brilliant and demanding film...
Peterloo,"The film is so lacking in dynamism that, if our current world weren't such a bloody mess, there wouldn't be much incentive to give it the time and attention the film demands."
Peterloo,"Whether you walk away from Leigh's no-nonsense slice of this history remembering the impassioned oratory of angry citizens or their murderous treatment by a cruel government is, on some level, Leigh's referendum on what we want from movies."
Peterloo,"Peterloo doesn't deliberately skimp on character, but it's the first of his movies in which no individual makes much of an impression, and each one is fundamentally subordinate to the larger event being painstakingly chronicled."
Peterloo,"It seems perverse that a film of such length should find no home for so many of its director's assets. Detailed character-work, complex domestic relationships, humour: these are elements that would have made the picture engaging."
Peterloo,"By the end of it, it's quite overwhelming... and it needs to have that kind of power."
Peterloo,There's a chance we may have underestimated Leigh as a director.
Peterloo,"Once we get to the march and the massacre itself, you'll be rooted to your seat."
Peterloo,It was like being trapped in an episode of Poldark. I kept half-hoping Demelza would drift in with one of her kidney pies and give us all a break.
Peterloo,"There are contemporary resonances for those who want them, but Peterloo succeeds on being an impactful recreation of a time and its injustices."
Peterloo,"We're reminded that Leigh used to do comedy. We also remember, more painfully, that he used to do comedy and tragedy together."
Peterloo,This is not Leigh's most diverting film but it is his most political.
Peterloo,It is lovely to look at. It has real sweep. The problem lies with the sometimes clunky dialogue and the occasionally rushed characterisation.
Peterloo,An epic period piece from Mike Leigh
Peterloo,"An earnest, colourful portrait of liberty and tyranny in 19th century England."
Peterloo,Peterloo so simply recounts the details of its subject matter that its culminating horror unsettlingly feels like little more than a cathartic inevitability.
Peterloo,"You can feel Leigh's fury glowering off the screen through the entire last act, but that fury does the film and the filmmaker little service."
Peterloo,Peterloo is purest Mike Leigh in the best sense.
Peterloo,"Leigh presents this history through a series of immobile setpiece scenes, crafted with dull fidelity, one rallying speech after another, as the radicals work themselves up towards action."
Peterloo,Leigh's achievement is to have made a period film with the same immediacy and sense of anger that runs through contemporary dramas like Hillsborough or Bloody Sunday.
Peterloo,"Mike Leigh's film is a powerful blunt weapon, hitting back for the people who refused to."
Peterloo,Those with the patience and attention span are rewarded; the last 30 minutes is perhaps the most visceral filmmaking Leigh has ever pulled off...
Peterloo,"There exists a cavernous gap between a powerful idea and a great movie, and it's where you will find this latest ambitious, if flawed, Mike Leigh project."
Peterloo,"The authenticity is immersive, even if the historical exposition occasionally feels like prep for an exam no one's warned you about."
Peterloo,Leigh's passion for the material seems to have led him to approach it from an angle more pedagogic than artistic.
Peterloo,"This magnificently-realised film moves from feeling like a long, dry history lesson to becoming an angrily-direct and emotional tribute to the reformers of the past."
Peterloo,"There is a danger of filing Peterloo away as an ""important film"" - but it is also a complex, rousing and rewarding one for anyone prepared to meet it on its own unapologetically ambitious terms."
Peterloo,"With this richly intelligent, passionate movie Mike Leigh has fought a brilliant rearguard action on history's political battlefield."
Peterloo,"It's a stately, explicitly rhetorical paean to the people - setting the past in stone while also lashing out at a present-day political order."
Frankie,"The approach taken by director Ira Sachs is utterly sincere and so utterly humourless, though the performances are quietly compelling..."
Frankie,"Even within the breezy parameters of the travelogue movie genre (think Eat Pray Love or Under the Tuscan Sun), this sun-kissed melodrama is decidedly lacking in drive."
Frankie,"It has its pleasures but after the nuance and emotional hits of Love Is Strange and Little Men, Frankie is a disappointment. Not even la Reine, Isabelle Huppert, can elevate this one."
Frankie,"A tad disappointing from Sachs, whose characters usually have more humour, honesty and heart."
Frankie,"Half the cast come to the rescue, guaranteeing, at least, a pleasant time."
Frankie,"Taking a role designed to collapse the divide between performer and character as opportunity to uncover new levels on naturalism, Huppert offers another beautifully modulated turn in a part that is primarily reactive."
Frankie,"The ensemble cast is uniformly first-rate, but Sachs' moribund movie is a slog."
Frankie,"Sachs manages this day in the life without cumbersome exposition thanks to the texture of this casting, all while keeping the disparate concerns of three generations moving."
Frankie,It's a little too late but it's also surpassingly lovely: an aching frame around the human muddle before we go home for good.
Frankie,"Alas, as whole, Frankie plays like one of Woody Allen's lesser, European-set films..."
Frankie,"[The] performances feel lived in, like they're actually friends meeting up for the fist time in years."
Frankie,"""Frankie"" never takes a risk, never explores the characters' problems in any meaningful way; it feels all surface."
Frankie,"It's essentially a-walk and-talk... They walk and they talk, everybody looks lovely, and the cheese even looks like it tastes good."
Frankie,"I feel like we've all seen this film [before], but they're all kind of enjoyable, like having a nice glass of rosé on a beautiful day."
Frankie,"[T]hanks to a superb cast and a welcome strain of comedic energy, ""Frankie"" turns out to be more than a pretty travelogue with melodrama."
Frankie,"[Sachs's] insistent pictorial sensibility reveals its purpose and its power in a crescendo of visionary wonder, in a matched pair of concluding sequences."
Frankie,"A lovely if muted experience, in which moments of silence and tranquility communicate as much as the naturalistic dialogue."
Frankie,"Sachs builds a physical world so relentlessly clean, classy, and gorgeous it teeters on the edge of travelogue. But he fails to people it with characters we could care much for or about, so busy are they shilling for banal observations on life."
Frankie,"[A] film that whisks us away, showcases such a talented and eclectic array of performers, and reconfirms a singular filmmaker's affecting artistry."
Frankie,"Frankie, for all of its refusal to give into any kind of traditional narrative satisfaction, is rife with terrific little moments."
Frankie,"The plot of ""Frankie,"" like so many of the characters, meanders, aimlessly at times, but like an expensive vacation, it's utterly lovely to experience and surprising when it's over."
Frankie,"A cast of excellent actors stand around looking tentative, delivering stilted lines in scenery whose beauty is perhaps meant to take up the expressive slack."
Frankie,ability to turn even the sappiest of scenarios into a nuanced tour de force.
Frankie,Sachs doesn't supply the neurotic wit that would make Frankie distinctive rather than just... nice.
Frankie,Any film that wastes the great Isabelle Huppert is a crime.
Frankie,"What a thorough pleasure to be in the company of Frankie, a film that feels like a sumptuous beach read on a lazy sunny afternoon."
Frankie,"The customarily skillful Sachs here takes a frankly rarefied approach a little reminiscent of the Australian director Ben Hackworth -- framing the idyllic ""natural"" settings as if they were backdrops made for the actors to stand against."
Frankie,"The whole thing struck me as pleasant, nicely judged, and unremarkable, right up to a final shot so graceful and moving that it sent waves of poignancy backwards through the movie."
Frankie,Frankie is proof that you can put brilliant actors in a beautiful setting and a film can still come out muddled.
Frankie,"Sachs doesn't exactly come a cropper here, but this melancholic drama is markedly less distinctive and piquant than recent titles of his such as Love Is Strange and Little Men."
Frankie,The disparity between the easy-breezy locale's doctrine of R&R and the gravely existential story that unfolds there results in a peculiarly heavy slightness.
Frankie,"Alongside the magnetic Isabelle Huppert in a role that draws with equal grace from her well of dry humor, flinty intelligence, diva hauteur and internalized sorrow, there are affecting moments to savor also from... a solid ensemble cast."
Frankie,"Sachs is such a talented film-maker, but this is a baffling misstep."
Frankie,"It's like an elegant bracelet that's modest enough to go unnoticed, but nevertheless reveals a quietly exquisite beauty to those who are willing to lean in and look closer (even if they have to squint)."
Frankie,"""Frankie"" may the closest that anyone has come to making an American version of an Eric Rohmer film."
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,"Altogether it's a rousing, passionate bit of film-making on a reasonably epic scale, with a cast of hundreds deployed for some big dusty battle scenes, which are duly impressive."
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,"There's little doubt that Rani's story is an engaging and undertold chapter of history, but The Warrior Queen of Jhansi is not the best way to tell it."
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,Devika is sincere in her portrayal in a simplified narrative that does little more than follow the form of a school essay on the Indian warrior queen.
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,"The pounding hooves that whisk us through the pre-credit montage recall the manner of storytelling audiences lapped up throughout the '60s, but which is now the stuff that Hallmark Channel dramas are made of."
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,Swati Bhise's old-fashioned historical epic is sincere but unexciting.
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,One wonders how Everett got mixed up in this mess.
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,"Will you be eager to learn more about this fierce ""Warrior Queen"" afterward? Yes. Will it be because you sensed more there than was melodramatically delivered? Probably."
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,"The makers of The Warrior Queen of Jhansi don't give viewers as many reasons to invest in their versions of these characters, not beyond speech-like declarations of intent and canned drama that often resolves itself in a matter of minutes."
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,"Earnestness and reverence is the death knell of many an ""inspiring"" movie, and ""The Warrior Queen of Jhansi"" falls into that trap."
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,It's a fascinating story that deserves a less superficial and more accurate treatment.
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,"Considering all the blood spilled before and since, this epilogue doesn't feel quite so triumphant as ""The Warrior Queen of Jhansi"" wants it to be."
To Dust,To Dust's humour is of the one-trick kind - an odd couple on an odd mission - but there is soul and small pleasures to its fly-by 92 minutes.
To Dust,"""To Dust"" has several things to recommend it. It's decidedly different, and that is no small accomplishment in this day and age."
To Dust,"Broderick's spot-on performance replete with familiar mannerisms and line deliveries in To Dust is a bittersweet thing, reminding you how much you've missed seeing him on the big screen."
To Dust,It's so odd that viewers need to see it.
To Dust,Shawn Snyder makes a strikingly original and winsome feature debut.
To Dust,"Beneath the sometimes grisly visuals and the pitch-black humor and the general weirdness, this is the story of two men with precious little in common who become friends against all odds..."
To Dust,"The movie could use a little more energy - this is Paul Mazursky territory, after all, not Andrei Tarkovsky - but in its sick-but-sweet attempt to reclaim grief from the trappings of tradition, ""To Dust"" is its own well-measured godsend."
To Dust,"[T]here's something in the relationship between these two partnerless men - their yearning for connection - that feels, beneath the jokes, very real and very recognizable."
To Dust,"Snyder does not sugarcoat the realities of grief or biological inevitability, although he does, rather surprisingly, find humor in the protagonist's unhealthy obsession."
To Dust,"Shmuel's trancelike idiocy is broad for my taste, but Röhrig's helplessness is affecting and has a larger resonance."
To Dust,"You can see what this movie is after, something cockeyed but sincere, something in the neighborhood of Paul Mazursky, Elaine May or Alexander Payne. But the writing and filmmaking just aren't quick enough."
To Dust,"First time feature film writer-director Shawn Snyder dives right into the nitty gritty of science, loss ,and faith, and delivers a charming, quirky, human and, at times, macabre, film."
To Dust,A dryly funny debut that pairs science and religious belief in a way that must surely be unique in the annals of cinema.
To Dust,"The deft execution and astute lead performances ultimately make this acquired taste of a movie not only digestible, but rather charming."
Family,Palathara once again proves that his voice is clearly one to be reckoned with.
Family,"Family...is purportedly about one place at a certain time, but it’s really about Everyplace Everytime, whenever and wherever in the world folks have colluded to keep the secrets they are ashamed of “in the family”."
Family,"Both as an unsettling portrait of a rural Christian community bound by faith and hypocrisy as well as a relentless character study of human transgressions, Family sees Palathara return to his assured form of filmmaking."
The Iron Orchard,"It is an intimate tale of triumphs and setbacks, but also a story of tremendous consequence."
The Iron Orchard,Editor David Teague skilfully places original animated inserts and favourite movie scenes to allow us a brief glimpse into Owen's wonderful Disneyfied psyche.
The Iron Orchard,"Life, Animated, directed by Roger Ross Williams, is a touching documentary about autism."
The Iron Orchard,"This documentary, through expressive sound design, appealing animation and Owen's observations, gives real insight into the mind of an autistic person."
The Iron Orchard,A wonderful example of the power of cinema and humanity.
The Iron Orchard,Particularly vivid and endearing.
The Iron Orchard,"Director Roger Ross Williams's immensely rewarding documentary tells the story of the Suskind family and shows how love, sensitive parenting and watching tons of kids' movies can save a life."
The Iron Orchard,"If Owen Suskind, its autistic subject, were a fictional character, we'd probably rebel against the heart-tugging arc of empowerment prescribed for him. We might even scoff."
The Iron Orchard,"Life, Animated is a feel-good documentary about autism, Disney movies and the stranglehold childhood has on adults."
The Iron Orchard,"The film's effects are maybe a little directly sentimental, but this is a tremendous true story of family love."
The Iron Orchard,"A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks."
The Iron Orchard,"You won't find many documentaries more heart-warming than Roger Ross Williams' Life, Animated."
The Iron Orchard,"A terrifically watchable, heartfelt documentary."
The Iron Orchard,Truth is indeed stranger and sometimes more beautiful than fiction.
The Iron Orchard,This is an important documentary about a developmental disability that affects so many people.
The Iron Orchard,"The humanity on display isn't grandiose, it isn't cloying, it just is."
The Iron Orchard,"""Life, Animated"" doesn't try to give a cure-all to autism. It shows how one family approached the complex puzzle with the help of Simba, Sebastian and Lumiere."
The Iron Orchard,It manages to be heartwarming and heartbreaking all at once.
The Iron Orchard,"There are moments of joy, revelation, connection, sadness and hope, and the film is very, very moving."
The Iron Orchard,Director Roger Ross Williams' storytelling skills are at their finest in an engaging story suffused throughout with emotion that never descends into mawkishness.
The Iron Orchard,I sobbed -- so much -- watching this movie.
The Iron Orchard,"This is an intelligent and understated film that nicely presents one very particular life experience that will, in its own way, inspire the viewer."
The Iron Orchard,"A vivid and warmhearted portrait of coming-of-age, differently."
The Iron Orchard,"As time passes, more people are understanding autism. And ""Life, Animated"" is definitely part of the solution."
The Iron Orchard,"Though Owen's achievements are extraordinary, the film demonstrates that there are things Disney cartoons can't teach: full self-sufficiency and satisfying adult sexual relationships."
The Iron Orchard,An emotionally powerful docudrama which shows an unexpected connectedness to Disney.
The Iron Orchard,"I had to fight off skepticism about Life, Animated - it feels a little tidy. But maybe there is something to be gained from identifying with a character onscreen if you have immense difficulty navigating the world."
The Iron Orchard,What the film is ultimately about is the extent to which love and caring can help turn a life around for a person deemed beyond reach.
The Iron Orchard,"Tells Owen's story in a way that lets us see through his eyes the way that ""Peter Pan"" and ""Aladdin"" let him see through ours."
The Iron Orchard,"""Life, Animated"" makes fascinating points, about the power of cinema, about meeting our loved ones where they are and, as Ron says, about who gets to decide what constitutes a meaningful life."
The Iron Orchard,"Owen has made immense progress, to which ""Life, Animated"" is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."
The Iron Orchard,It's the best Disney movie that Disney didn't make.
The Iron Orchard,"""Life, Animated"" is powerful and emotional, without being manipulative. It is deeply inspiring, without trying to be."
The Iron Orchard,"A young autistic man connects to the world through Disney animated movies. Instead of false hope, this truly inspirational film offers up possibility, the chance of a stimulus that might get past the blocks of developmental disorder."
The Iron Orchard,An absorbing and ultimately exhilarating documentary.
The Iron Orchard,"The Suskinds' humongous hearts are obviously in the right place and their openness is to be admired and encouraged-even if a book, more than a movie, remains the better venue to fairly and honestly tell Owen's extraordinary story."
The Iron Orchard,"Mr. Williams's decision to prioritize his subject's point of view feels frustratingly restrictive. Belaboring the cartoon connection, the director leaves the family struggles that enrich Mr. Suskind's 2014 book of the same title stubbornly veiled."
The Iron Orchard,"Emotional honesty ... is ""Life, Animated's"" greatest strength."
The Iron Orchard,"If you believe in magic, Life, Animated is the potion for you."
The Iron Orchard,A deeply felt documentary ...
The Iron Orchard,"All of this is rather straightforward and polished, but some of the film's most affecting moments come through animations designed by artist Mac Guff."
The Iron Orchard,"The film is tender and patient, as fascinated by the challenges of daily life as it is by the dramatic medical mystery at its heart."
The Iron Orchard,"It's hard to nitpick too much, given how insightful and emotional so much of this documentary is."
The Iron Orchard,It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse.
The Iron Orchard,"It's a rich and emotional story, warm and kind and often overwhelming."
The Iron Orchard,Roger Ross Williams' captivating documentary explores a young autistic man's growth and progress through his obsession with Disney animated movies.
The Iron Orchard,A beguiling mix of animated storytelling and narration that doesn't flinch from exploring the emotional highs and lows that accompany a life with autism.
American Woman,"Writer/director Semi Chellas, making her feature debut... [is]'s not afraid to whisper big questions, to make space for small, beautiful moments (pelicans!), or to keep things quietly tense. Because even a slow simmer eventually boils over."
American Woman,American Woman is as nondescript and invisible as its in-hiding subjects try and appear to the public.
American Woman,"The film is lively and detailed enough so it is never boring, but it never takes off dramatically or realizes its intriguing possibilities either."
American Woman,"""American Woman"" tries to give us a fresh angle on a familiar subject, but the film is listless and desultory."
Canal Street,"The film... is nobly intended but, as drama, rickety."
Canal Street,"Director and co-writer LaMarr does a fine job of cutting back and forth to the various storylines, and connecting them when the moment is right."
Her Smell,"There have been plenty of movies about self-destructive rock musicians, but none quite like this."
Her Smell,"There's a claustrophobic, almost airless feeling to this -- it's almost suffocating, but it's always compelling."
Her Smell,You won't forget it. You can't forget it.
Her Smell,"We basically don't get any escape [from Becky Something]. We are either right up in her face, with those close-ups and handheld camera, or they're employing a steadicam that follows her around as she stalks the rooms and corridors backstage."
Her Smell,"Stretched over 135 minutes and overloaded with shout-to-the-rafters confrontations, Her Smell has too much talking and squawking, and not enough rocking and rolling."
Her Smell,"Movies about self-destructing rock stars, whether based on real idols or centering on wholly invented characters, are often hackneyed. But Perry's pulsating, quicksilver film, boosted by Moss's jagged magnetism, vivifies the genre."
Her Smell,"Moss is endlessly fascinating, basking in the liberating comfort of surrendered glamour. She inhabits every cranny and crevice of the character's despairing, terrified, burnt-out, blasted self."
Her Smell,The genius of Her Smell is that it's not about Becky. It's about the chaos she causes.
Her Smell,"You can quibble with this movie's title, but it gives redemption stories a good name."
Her Smell,"But by opening at rock bottom, instead of the heights, Perry makes it difficult to care about Becky's fall from, and slow crawl back to, grace."
Her Smell,"If the writer-director has a gift, it's for orchestrating caustic confrontation, and for a while, that's mainly what Her Smell offers, impressively and at length."
Her Smell,"New material from the challenging auteur, one that reflects a deeper sense of maturity, displayed mainly in the idea of the possibility of redemption."
Her Smell,"Despite all the claustrophobic airlessness of Her Smell, you won't be able to quit it if you stay with its jumbled dialogues and dizzying pace long enough."
Her Smell,"We're getting a portrait - albeit flawed - of a woman, disintegrating before our very eyes."
Her Smell,Her Smell is a journey through hell and back that feels more gratifying for being difficult.
Her Smell,A fame-to-flameout movie that leaves scorch marks on the brain.
Her Smell,"For all its yelling and theatrics, Her Smell can't even be bothered to figure out where the outlet is."
Her Smell,"Moss, so perfectly calibrated in everything from her career-making role on Mad Men to her small but brilliant turn in Jordan Peele's Us, does the best she can with the material here, though it never quite rises up to meet her."
Her Smell,"Her Smell is an uneven movie, occasionally dipping into clichés. But Moss's performance works..."
Her Smell,"Elisabeth Moss is a primal, predatory force in ""Her Smell,"" a female-centric spin on the classic debauched rock star story."
Her Smell,"Moss varies the volume and the tempo of her performance, calling forth cascades of profane invention and rills of whispery poetry, but she always stays in the same key, the key of Becky."
Her Smell,Elisabeth Moss turns in a five-alarm blaze of a performance as a frontwoman who makes Courtney Love look like Mother Teresa.
Her Smell,"Her Smell is perhaps more of an uncomfortable watch than an enjoyable one, giving the viewer a front row seat to Becky's destructive behavior. But it's impossible to turn away from Moss, especially when she's flashing that maniacal smile."
Her Smell,"As a ranting, drug-addled mess, Moss is magnetic, drawing your eye to her every move in an Oscar-worthy performance."
Her Smell,"What really elevates the film's darkness is its propensity to find light, redemption and communal love in the destructive throes of the music scene."
Her Smell,"This is a soulful portrait of a talented but troubled artist, not to mention an exploration of female friendships within an industry still dominated by powerful men."
Her Smell,"Some may not have the stomach for it, and yet Moss's oscillating, energy-devouring performance and the real-time composition of Perry's scenes make it almost impossible to look away."
Her Smell,"Over and above the furious-and ultimately painfully tender-drama, Perry achieves something of a new, grand version of his own cinematic music."
Her Smell,"A story of filth and fury and, eventually, of placidity and peace, Her Smell is Alex Ross Perry's most chaotic and unmuffled film—until it isn't."
Her Smell,"Once you're in there, you go with it. Elisabeth Moss's commitment, and the burnished bravura of her talent, pull you through."
Her Smell,"What resounds is not merely the sense that Moss is great, but the sense that we've barely scratched the surface of what she can do."
Her Smell,A turned-up-to-11 emotional hurricane.
Her Smell,Bafflingly unbalanced.
Her Smell,"An uneven, unsettling film."
Her Smell,"More loudly stylized than his earlier films, ""Her Smell"" is visceral nightmare from the moment it starts; if the script evokes John Cassavetes, the aesthetic seems more inspired by Gaspar Noé."
Her Smell,"Truly a painful sit for the first 80 minutes, after which a measure of redemption arrives. But it's too little far too late."
Her Smell,"Wildly uneven, sporadically brilliant, occasionally unbearable, Alex Ross Perry's sprawling portrait of a self-destructive rock star is carried by a performance by Elisabeth Moss which is turned all the way up to eleven, and beyond."
Lucy in the Sky,Hawley articulates Lucy's mental breakdown as if running through an uninspired checklist of bourgeois female suffering that he hopes will compensate for a lack of character building.
Lucy in the Sky,A film I enjoyed far more than I thought I would.
Lucy in the Sky,"It's proper acting, from one of the modern greats."
Lucy in the Sky,"Portman gives her all, but she out-classes this rather pedestrian telling of a story of stratospheric levels of obsession and ambition."
Lucy in the Sky,"By failing to find the solid ground in [Lisa] Nowak's story, Lucy in the Sky leaves us stranded in the stars."
Lucy in the Sky,"An interesting take on the transformative nature of space travel and its effects on those who experience it. Sadly though, there isn't enough here in the way of a plot, or much else really, to warrant the film's excessive two hour running time."
Lucy in the Sky,"A flimsy, effortful project that simply has no footing either as fact or convincing fiction. It's in freefall from the word go."
Lucy in the Sky,"[Natalie] Portman has a great track record of playing women under extreme psychological pressure and this turn is equally Oscar-worthy. Unfortunately, the film supporting her, over-directed by TV's Noah Hawley, isn't of the same calibre."
Lucy in the Sky,Lucy in the Sky wastes Natalie Portman in a film that fails to grasp that not every story about women is one of empowerment.
Lucy in the Sky,"[M]uch of ""Lucy in the Sky,"" it doesn't connect down here on Earth and is caught somewhere in the cosmos."
Lucy in the Sky,"It's contemplative and meditative, sure, but it doesn't wind up saying anything."
Lucy in the Sky,"[Natalie] Portman gives her all in her performance, which is the only saving grace of the film, and in the end this film is a complete misfire. To paraphrase the titular song, picture yourself seeing any other movie than this."
Lucy in the Sky,It's a deep-thinking character study that's provocatively if imperfectly presented - at least until the story devolves right along with its subject's state of mind.
Lucy in the Sky,"""Lucy"" should soar, but instead, it flatlines."
Lucy in the Sky,"Lucy in the Sky is a vapid, silly, and occasionally insulting movie that wastes its excellent cast."
Lucy in the Sky,"Unintentionally funny and then just plain sad, Lucy in the Sky is one of the most disappointing films of 2019."
Lucy in the Sky,"Lucy in the Sky feels unfocused, distracted, and tonally uncertain."
Lucy in the Sky,"I'd call Lucy a missed opportunity, given the juiciness of the source material. Too bad."
Lucy in the Sky,"In its ambitions, ""Lucy in the Sky"" seems at first glance to be a female answer to ""Ad Astra,"" but it steadily devolves into something worthy of the Lifetime channel."
Lucy in the Sky,"A sensitive, artful and rather odd retelling of a well-known news story."
Lucy in the Sky,"""Lucy in the Sky"" has the style of a biopic, but we know it's not, so at times it's hard to know what we're watching and why."
Lucy in the Sky,"""Lucy in the Sky"" says it's inspired by a true story, and while it draws some of its details from what really happened, there is very little inspiration evident on screen."
Lucy in the Sky,"Sometimes we look on confused and shaking our head, but more often we stare with glassy-eyed wonder at a world-and a movie-that is teeming with all sorts of messy life."
Lucy in the Sky,It is boring.
Lucy in the Sky,"Unfortunately, it's an anticlimactic conclusion at best, full of tacked-on thriller shenanigans that, once they've petered out, make you wonder exactly why this story drew the filmmakers' attention to begin with."
Lucy in the Sky,"It's a dispiriting mess and waste of talent, sunk by a lack of focus, misguided choices and insistently unproductive, at times incoherent clashing tones."
Lucy in the Sky,Lucy presents Portman with another juicy assignment.
Lucy in the Sky,"There are moments of intense beauty in ""Lucy in the Sky,"" mostly when Hawley zooms in on his star's evocative face. But Portman alone can't save this muddled endeavor."
Lucy in the Sky,"Co-screenwriters Hawley, Brian C. Brown and Elliott DiGuiseppi offensively pin Lucy's breakdown and consequent ill-fated road trip on NASA's ingrained sexism, bypassing an empathetic assessment of her unraveling cognitive state."
Lucy in the Sky,"""Lucy"" comes from such an oddball scandal, yet it rockets past the inherent weirdness at its core and settles for banality."
Lucy in the Sky,"Lucy in the Sky has plenty of arresting cosmic visuals, and on the other hand tries to portray a human drama about an overachiever pushed to her breaking point. But those two halves never cohere into a whole."
Lucy in the Sky,"Though Portman impressively commits, the performance is ultimately empty, because Lucy's distress is explained only in vague conversations with Mark that further reduce her feelings, everything from love to anger, as ""not real."""
Lucy in the Sky,"But even in her lowest moments, in the craziest scenarios, Hawley and Portman never deny Lucy's power, making room for a small sense of anarchic triumph to break through, with a wink and a wisecrack and a will of iron."
Lucy in the Sky,"Trying for humane drama but landing somewhere nearer basic-cable shtick, it asks a bowl-cutted Portman to deliver accusatory lines like, ""I read your emails while you were in space!"" with a straight face."
Lucy in the Sky,Noah Hawley treats his protagonist's story as a somber tragedy that at times stoops to trashiness.
Lucy in the Sky,"There's a point at which this joke stops being funny and turns sad, and it's very early in its over two hours runtime."
Lucy in the Sky,You're left wondering why anyone would make the astronaut-in-a-diaper movie if they didn't want to make an astronaut-in-a-diaper movie.
Lucy in the Sky,"It's not that Lucy in the Sky is boring - quite the opposite, in fact - yet it does feel like a story that would have been told much better by a female director, or at the very least, a female writer."
Lucy in the Sky,"Even when we don't know what the hell Lucy is doing, Portman makes her certainty a blast."
Lucy in the Sky,"How to end this story and reclaim its leading player without simply writing off Lucy as a pathetic clinical case? The film doesn't quite solve this problem, but it's an amusing, disquieting footnote to the triumphant story of space travel."
Lucy in the Sky,"Noah Hawley's directorial debut may have started out as a feminist-forward film decrying the fact that women have to work five times as hard to succeed in the workplace, but it ends up being a movie whose message boils down to, ""Ladies be crazy."""
Lucy in the Sky,"The most frustrating thing about Hawley's telling isn't that it sidesteps the dirty truth, but rather that it doesn't create one of its own."
Lucy in the Sky,"Director Noah Hawley wants us to understand this woman's plight, to sympathize with her dilemma, but he also wants to rib us with his cutesy needle drops and snazzy visual tics."
Lucy in the Sky,A film that initially seemed to be aiming in the direction of a female-oriented companion piece to the presently arriving Ad Astra instead contents itself to live in the normal world of sexual jealousies and revenge.
Lucy in the Sky,"Hawley [is] a gifted visual storyteller who triple-knots his own shoelaces here, stumbling over cumbersome metaphors... when he should have just entrusted his leading lady to carry the narrative."
Sword of Trust,"Poised between Christopher Guest and Mike Leigh, Lynn Shelton lets talented performers develop their characters, and it grounds the heightened premise to keep us in their side."
Sword of Trust,This is a hangout movie -- and I like hanging out with these people.
Sword of Trust,"For a comedy about an old weapon with a dulled blade, Sword of Truth is razor sharp in just about every way."
Sword of Trust,"It's equal parts spry, improvisational comedy and salient social commentary."
Sword of Trust,"Even when Maron is playing someone who is the saddest and most cynical person in the room (and maybe the whole town), he is a brilliant reactor who delivers pithy comebacks and wry observations with pitch-perfect timing."
Sword of Trust,"A smart, politically barbed comedy about truthiness and consequences."
Sword of Trust,"In this entertainment day and age, originality counts for something, and ""Sword of Trust"" is nothing if not novel."
Sword of Trust,"A throwback to the kind of rambling, character-driven, micro-budgeted indie flicks that used to be all over theaters in the 1990s."
Sword of Trust,"""Sword of Trust"" is a perfect comedy of manners for our post-truth age, when historical consensus has become subject to the same kind of interpretive haggling as the price of a kitschy cream pitcher."
Sword of Trust,"The film neither unites nor divides; it shambles, scoring a few points, mostly because of Maron's rumpled charisma, and Watkins' oddball, push-pull timing."
Sword of Trust,"It reflects this slice of life. It doesn't comment on it or broaden our understanding of it. But it's smart and original, and that's enough."
Sword of Trust,Everything could be sharper. It isn't dull.
Sword of Trust,"Sword of Trust feints at being an Ideas movie, but really only wants to hang - which is certainly not a crime, but given the subject matter, and These Times, it's a little disappointing."
Sword of Trust,[Lynn] Shelton weaves multiple coils of rage into a tense and volatile mechanism that... yields bold and surprising implications for politics at large and for modes of resistance.
Sword of Trust,"In a role tailormade for his uniquely sardonic skills, Maron is wonderful."
Sword of Trust,"Sword of Trust is a modest, wobbly picture, and it falls apart as it rambles toward its ending. Yet it never feels like a waste of time. Sometimes being invited along for the ride is reward enough."
Sword of Trust,"But as its cast of terrific comics thrusts and parries, Sword of Trust makes improvisation - something really difficult to pull off at feature length - seem an absolute snap."
Sword of Trust,"Sword of Trust is light and satisfying. It left me while a smile on my face, and that's more than I can say for other, far more ambitious endeavors. Shelton and her co-writer Mike O'Brien earn my thanks."
Sword of Trust,"The humor has a persistent goofy streak, but what sticks to the ribs is the poignant stuff."
Sword of Trust,"As with all of Shelton's improv-inspired movies, the plot offers plenty of interest but the personalities provide the purpose. She chooses her actors very carefully, and then lets them loose to explore, expand, or ignore the script."
Sword of Trust,May this be the start of something special.
Sword of Trust,Sword of Trust is rich with humor and heart with a sophisticated edge of snark.
Sword of Trust,"Marc Maron's commanding aura of regret gives the film, despite its missed opportunities, an emotional center."
Sword of Trust,"Even as the narrative fizzles, the movie remains an appealing assemblage of timely themes."
Sword of Trust,"Human moments punctuate and overlap with the sillier ones, giving Sword of Truth a sense of generosity and an emotional core in addition to its laughs."
Sword of Trust,I wanted to discard every element of the plot and just hang out with the characters over coffee for an hour-something that speaks to both Shelton's gift with character/performances and how little I cared about what actually happens in this movie.
Sword of Trust,"Its concerns are person-to-person rather than broadly political in the end, which is far from surprising in a Shelton film. On this modest scale, it finds reason for hope."
Sword of Trust,"Everyone onscreen is so good at this kind of work that one wishes more tightly scripted comedy screenplays had such savory dialogue, or inspired character conceptions."
Diane,For decades Kent Jones has been one of the most eloquent and perceptive film critics in the U.S.; with this devastating chamber drama... he also proves himself to be a keen observer of psychology and American social mores.
Diane,"We usually expect that a film named after its protagonist will sooner or later reveal everything about that person, give us the whole woman; Diane, by contrast, comes in pieces"
Diane,"Diane is a sublime puzzle of a movie, resolving itself without completely yielding its secrets."
Diane,"The reason Diane (the film) exists is not to propose and then solve a mystery, but to engage with Diane (the person)."
Diane,"""Diane"" is a sharp, attuned, quiet stunner that underplays at every turn."
Diane,"""Diane"" affords Martin, Parsons and company the chance to do honest, low-keyed work with material worth the effort."
Diane,"[It's] a remarkable film that will see Diane through many losses, and some gains, with her to the last."
Diane,"It's a rarity, and a real pleasure, to find a movie that presents without condescension rural working-class people, especially women."
Diane,Place manages to twist herself physically and emotively into such pretzel-like knots I was astonished by the emotional magnitude of what it was she was doing.
Diane,"While ""Diane"" is perhaps 96 of the most depressing minutes on film this year, its quiet honesty is compelling. treating aging and death with a respect to the inevitability of both."
Diane,The more adventurous or open-hearted may step into this film and find a kind of translucent everyday poetry.
Diane,[A] naturalistic portrait of service and self-sacrifice by way of a quietly astonishing title performance by Mary Kay Place.
Diane,"With ""Diane,"" as in life, it feels like nothing's going on, but everything's going on."
Diane,The sharp-edged bonds that hold a family and a community together are examined intimately but vaguely in this lyrical melodrama by the writer and director Kent Jones.
Diane,"Diane is consistently absorbing but low-key, that won't appeal to some people . It's a compassionate character study that showcases one of the most endearing of all contemporary actresses, and that's what makes it well worth seeing"
Diane,A meticulously detailed portrait of the type of woman who never gets a movie made about her.
Diane,"Kent has assembled a superb group of character actors here, who tell lived-in stories with extraordinary sensitivity and grace."
Diane,"What looks at first like a solid, well-carpentered exercise in downbeat indie realism ends up, by dint of its unexpected tonal and temporal leaps and sudden formal ruptures, in less easily definable territory."
Diane,"The movie is populated by people we seldom see in mainstream films, so seldom that we may not remember the pleasure we've been missing."
Diane,"Jones fills her existential space with a bracing, though never unfeeling, inquiry into what it feels like to confront the steady drip of accumulating pain, and loss, and no longer being needed as we age."
Diane,"Trying to forestall our loneliness is what connects us. That's not a depressing conclusion - it's the beginning of a design for living. In its mundane way, Diane gives you a glimpse of the sublime."
Diane,"It's Place's subtle, moment-to-moment performance that provides the balance to save Diane from ho-hum tedium."
Diane,Mary Kay Place... gets the role of a lifetime in Diane.
Diane,Mary Kay Place delivers one of the year's best performances in this shattering character study from writer-director Kent Jones in a narrative feature debut that sneaks up and floors you.
Diane,"In the context of the modern multiplex, ""Diane"" amounts to an act of cinematic bravery, not just in its choice of tough-sell material, but in the patience with which Jones tends it."
Diane,"If the overall effect of this tender yet unsparing movie is a bit depressive, it's nothing its maker should apologize for."
Diane,"Compared to Diane's rather staid first half, this ambitious formalist turn is welcome. But fittingly, perhaps, for a film so fixated with death, it's too little, too late."
Diane,"A loose-limbed, deceptively modest portrait of small-town Massachusetts as seen through the eyes of a stoic septuagenarian widow, whose loved ones are falling sick and dropping dead at a rather alarming rate."
Diane,"Life is often meant to come undone, meant for the center to not hold...Diane is about loss and recovery, and the spinning of the world long after we die."
Diane,"Mary Kay Place is marvelous in the leading role, and her screen presence is so arm and comforting, we think we know her. Jones uses that familiarity, brilliantly."
Diane,"Excellent direction, dialogue and ensemble acting make what's on view a totally captivating look at the passage of time and last chapter of life."
Diane,"It's a great performance, and a studio would be wise to pick this film up so that the rest of the world can see it."
Diane,"Kent Jones conditions us to expect that Diane will follow its protagonist to her death, with little overt plot to speak off, in a quiet refutation of the three-act contrivances of most cinema."
Diane,"The past hangs over ""Diane"" not just as a burden or nostalgia (though it can be that too), but as an enthralling and entangling reminder of life's mystery."
Diane,It's a pinhole portrait of life on Earth; a non-judgmental story about trying to reconcile meaning with meaningless before the well runs dry and it rains again.
Diane,"Raw, real and quietly affecting."
Diane,A strong work and one of the peaks of this year's Tribeca slate.
The Tomorrow Man,"Always worth seeing these two actors, but not necessarily in this movie."
The Tomorrow Man,"An apocalyptic septuagenarian romance that leads with its heart rather than its head, ""The Tomorrow Man"" is warm in spots but never quite comes together."
The Tomorrow Man,"Ronnie? She's just looking for someone to sing Muskrat Love with. If you are as well, this quaint, doting film might be your thing."
The Tomorrow Man,The Tomorrow Man gives off a feeling of having seen it all before.
The Tomorrow Man,"For all its eccentricities, The Tomorrow Man plays it too safe."
The Tomorrow Man,There's a lack of chemistry that makes for a listlessness of narrative.
The Tomorrow Man,"John Lithgow and Blythe Danner make an offbeat and winning combination, with total belief that they're in a really good movie. Unfortunately, they're not."
The Tomorrow Man,The movie's ending could be called a twist. But it's really more of a belly flop.
The Tomorrow Man,Debut writer-director Noble Lincoln Jones' dramedy is a delightful oddity in our superhero era.
The Tomorrow Man,"If you cherish the rare opportunity to watch magnificent actors as perfect as Blythe Danner and John Lithgow giving it all they've got, in a film about grown-ups, then the line starts here."
The Tomorrow Man,The actors bring a great deal of humanity to keep a wobbly script from going too far off balance.
The Tomorrow Man,"A cloying, at times disturbing tale of two dotty seniors whose eccentricities unexpectedly mesh."
The Tomorrow Man,"Makes some astute observations about the coping mechanisms we use to protect ourselves from the world, with Jones eliciting solid performances from John Lithgow and Blythe Danner as two troubled senior citizens embarking on a tenuous courtship."
The Tomorrow Man,"While the film's last 30 seconds are refreshing, they hardly redeem the previous 90 minutes of utter predictability."
The Tomorrow Man,The film is content to peddle the naïve notion that love is the panacea for all that ails you.
The Tomorrow Man,[T]he film's packaging has an attractive simplicity - amplifying an overall effect of everyday strangeness that's finally more reassuring than truly bizarre.
The Tomorrow Man,Keeps chasing a quirky scenario that never settles in.
The Tomorrow Man,"Noble Jones' first feature... would have worked superbly as a half-hour Twilight Zone episode, but this December-December love story between two mild eccentrics in a small town is remarkably unremarkable."
The Hummingbird Project,"What might have made for either a thrilling, high-stakes drama or, at the very least, an intelligent comedy, ends up wildly uneven."
The Hummingbird Project,"Although sometimes it gets bogged down in the details of drilling, The Hummingbird Project extracts enough entertainment value from an unpromising premise, greatly helped by Jesse Eisenberg finding the humanity in his hustler."
The Hummingbird Project,"Part thriller, part family drama, part satirical commentary on the way that the pursuit of wealth is a cultural cancer that taints everything it touches, The Hummingbird Project is no less compelling for its odd mishmash of components."
The Hummingbird Project,"It sounds deeply unappetizing, but in fact, it's really enjoyable to watch. It's about obsession in a way I really like..."
The Hummingbird Project,"It's typical of a movie, written and directed by the Canadian film-maker Kim Nguyen, that hits all the right genre beats while consistently reaching for something more."
The Hummingbird Project,It's the kind of verbose corporate parable David Mamet would sit down to write after a heavy night on the sauce.
The Hummingbird Project,"It may be a modest indie film, but it deserves a broad audience. Highly recommended."
The Hummingbird Project,"That the film is watchable at all, as incongruity, improbability and incomprehensibility accumulate, is a tribute to Canadian director Kim Nguyen, skilfully negotiating a script by Kim Nguyen."
The Hummingbird Project,A finance story that stretches beyond the usual coke-addled Wall Street traders.
The Hummingbird Project,"It's an odd tale, but in its sneaky way, an unexpectedly engaging one."
The Hummingbird Project,[A]n invigorating snapshot of greed that examines how far competitors will go to gain even the slightest fraction of an edge over their rivals in the stock market.
The Hummingbird Project,What makes The Hummingbird Project so intriguing is that it explores areas of business - and of industrial espionage - so esoteric that it's hard to imagine that it's really a business model.
The Hummingbird Project,The Hummingbird Project runs a lot thicker and deeper than that fiber-optic cable.
The Hummingbird Project,"And so you will get no Scorsesian tracking shots of firecracker trading floors, no giddy frat boy Champagne-shaking antics; this is a slow-boil thriller coursing with melancholy."
The Hummingbird Project,A believability problem hampers this potentially fascinating story about the high-tech Wild West.
The Hummingbird Project,"Somewhere, buried within the innards of writer/director Kim Nguyen's The Hummingbird Project, is the skeleton of a compelling techno-thriller."
The Hummingbird Project,"""The Hummingbird Project"" basically works; it's intriguing; the actors play it just straight enough to make it feel like a fact-based drama (though it isn't) with a few darkly comic details."
The Hummingbird Project,It all feels a bit contrived.
The Hummingbird Project,It may be haphazard and loosely focused. But thanks to Skarsgård it's never really boring.
The Hummingbird Project,At once an offbeat comedy and a satisfyingly weird thriller.
The Hummingbird Project,"It's a lot to pack into a movie of less than two hours of running time. To Nguyen's credit, he balances the elements of his screenplay with such skill that the audience doesn't get too lost in the weeds."
The Hummingbird Project,"[Skarsgård is] often the best part of anything he's in, but here he's uncanny."
The Hummingbird Project,"Whatever it takes to keep a techno hellraiser on its feet, this humdrum Hummingbird doesn't have it, despite the efforts of Eisenberg and Skarsgård to breathe some life into it."
The Hummingbird Project,"Sometimes funny, sometimes smart, always watchable, but perhaps the film's dedication to turning a clever tale into something profound was a miscalculation."
The Hummingbird Project,"When a story is predicated on something as dramatically inert as laying high-speed fiber-optic cable, it requires characters more fully fleshed out than those on presentation here."
The Hummingbird Project,"This one works overtime, shifting gears repeatedly without once providing enough substance for the viewer to engage."
The Hummingbird Project,That so much might be riding on so little is a critical irony that The Hummingbird Project recognizes but ultimately fumbles.
The Hummingbird Project,"While its banter keeps the scenes moving along briskly, Vinny talks in that scammy ""we're all going to be millionaires"" way you've seen in umpteen other finance sagas."
The Hummingbird Project,"At its best The Hummingbird Project is a parable about failure, but one that ultimately undercuts itself with redeeming goo."
The Hummingbird Project,A smartly entertaining and unexpectedly human film...
The Hummingbird Project,"""The Hummingbird Project"" may be too committed to its popcorn mechanics to double as a truly brainy exposé, but it pays other dividends."
The Hummingbird Project,"Throughout, the film can't decide what attitude to strike toward its characters' evident greed."
The Hummingbird Project,"A defiantly odd thriller involving esoteric subject matter, The Hummingbird Project tells a familiar story of ambition and greed with enough eccentricity that the movie's strangeness becomes one of its chief attributes."
The Hummingbird Project,An entertaining vehicle for vivid performances by both actors.
The Hummingbird Project,"There's a good reason why no one's ever made a movie about this before - in fact, there are probably a few."
The Hummingbird Project,"There's a fascinating performance near the center of The Hummingbird Project, but director Kim Nguyen never finds the urgency in his feels-true-but-isn't narrative."
The Hummingbird Project,"Though this intriguing genre-hybrid might be just a little too odd for more mainstream success, this is a promising step in the right direction for Nguyen."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"It has a scrappy, indie feel that I like...not for everyone...but an honest and compassionate account, the pain and the ecstasy of the creative process..."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"It'd be easy to map Gilliam on to Grisoni, a film-maker dogged by his artistic misfires and the mess left in their wake. Really, though, he's Quixote, stuck in a noble past and wilfully disconnected from a present that jostles uncomfortably close."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,A staggering misfire that's both unambitious and bloated.
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"It's a messy, unfocused film that seems so in awe of its own existence that it can't quite summon the energy to tell a worthwhile story."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Neither a splendid phoenix from the ashes nor a complete failure, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is erratic, occasionally inspired, occasionally dull, but shot through with a grandiose sense of ambition."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"The melancholy is the saving grace, one man out of time immortalising another. Gilliam refrains from explicit meta, but winks over the fourth wall."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,It's fitfully entertaining. I will say that Jonathan Pryce is perfect in [this] role.
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"""The end result is messy, ragged, uneven, all over the place. But it's also the single best Gilliam film to hit theaters in 20 years."""
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"This is Gilliam at his most Gilliam, and that's fine, but there's nothing left to say."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"So after all that heartache, it looks as though Gilliam's dream has turned into something of a nightmare."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"It's exactly the kind of odd, reality-skewing fantasy you'd expect from the inventive Gilliam."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"To anyone who has followed the parabolic arcs of Gilliam's career, it's a fascinating text; to the more casual viewer, it might come off only as a meandering mess."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"The story doesn't follow Cervantes in every detail, but there is no mistaking Gilliam's deep appreciation of the book. ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"" works best as an exuberant, not always disciplined work of critical appropriation."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Don Quixote turns out to be a pretty typical Gilliam film: whimsically daffy, frantically overstuffed, and art-directed to within in an inch of its life. It's often transporting, but even more often exhausting."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,Perhaps after all these years The Man Who Killed Don Quixote was never going to live up to the movie we'd built in our heads. Maybe that was an impossible dream.
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,Adam Driver brings a Nicolas Cage-esque zeal to his terrifically loony performance as Toby.
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Witty, goofy, and glorious, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is Terry Gilliam's best film in two decades."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"By the end of Terry Gilliam's film, Cervantes's heroes are at last free to move beyond representative confinement and once more speak freely as equals."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Thinking how different the world feels from even five years ago, let alone 25, the movie feels at a remove, not so much dated as just distanced, needlessly off on its own."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Visually heroic, narratively tilting at windmills, Terry Gilliam's 25-year obsession with Miguel de Cervantes' eccentric knight-errant embraces illusion with such devotion I ended up liking The Man Who Killed Don Quixote more than fighting it."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"A thoroughly middle-of-the-road effort, it may have been inevitable that actually watching director Terry Gilliam's cinematic great white whale would be a bit of a letdown after 30 years of myth-making."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,A treat.
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Even if it doesn't always come together, it does entertain, bearing all the hallmarks of Gilliam's gleefully barmiest projects."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"A film suffused with a love of art, and of those who would dare to make it."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"There is so much goodwill towards Gilliam's quixotic Quixote project that it's easy to forgive its problems, of which there are many."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"There's enough of a germ of something in Don Quixote that you find yourself shaking your head by its climax, wondering, wait, what were we talking about again?"
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"It's as if Gilliam is pulling us into his madness, into a world where things are both better and more dangerous."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Even when the film feels like a circuitous, effortful mess, it's often an intentional one..."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"It is an intensely personal piece of filmmaking, a movie shot through with sneaky, unruly pleasures and no small poignancy."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Strangely for such a labour of love, is that it's missing a bit of soul."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,It's clear that Gilliam developed a genuine relationship to this material from his own creative yearning.
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"Neither as bad as you fear nor as good as it deserves to be given the sheer effort of will that went into getting it made, it is enough that The Man Who Killed Don Quixote lives."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,Rarely have such brave deeds yielded so meager a reward.
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"If anything, it's what the director's fans most feared: a lumbering, confused, and cacophonous mess."
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,What a dull place the world would be without Terry Gilliam.
Mia and the White Lion,ERROR
The Nightingale,ERROR
Union,ERROR
Christmas Jars,"Book-based film has mature themes, inspiring messages."
Christmas Jars,Christmas Jars will definitely be something families can watch together for a cheesy batch of Christmas feels!
Cruel Intentions,Surprisingly entertaining... for a softcore porn soap opera flick.
The Public,"It's heart is in the right place in many ways, but it just outlines everything so clearly in red marker that it doesn't let you discovers things for yourself. Still, it's an estimable effort in some ways."
The Public,"That everything ends on a weird happy-clappy high is indicative of a scattershot project that could have done with less ambition, more focus."
The Public,"The Public presents a heartening story of triumph of good over evil, but sadly lacks the gravitas one would usually expect from these types of stories."
The Public,"It's all a bit old-fashioned and earnest but with US civil liberties under attack, it's a timely celebration of humanity."
The Public,"It is a film with its heart in the right place, but the dialogue and characterisation are both plonkingly unconvincing."
The Public,"Making a feature that pleads the cause of the homeless is a laudable achievement, so it's all the more unfortunate that Estevez is unable to eliminate some of the obvious flaws in an otherwise compelling, and timely, drama."
The Public,"It's hard to play a good man doing the right thing. Saints are dramatically dull, but Estevez gets away with it here."
The Public,"Estevez's drama gets a little preachy in the second half, but ""The Public"" is passionate about its cause and the cast... deliver like the pros they are."
The Public,"Alec Baldwin, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Slater and Gabrielle Union all look like they'd rather be somewhere else."
The Public,Writer-director-star Emilio Estevez turns a library occupied by homeless citizens as ground zero for our under-fire democracy. Bravo!
The Public,"The story's moral has obviousness problems, the plot's predictable, and its sweetness will annoy as many as it pleases. But it's still warm, winsome and droll, and the spectacular cast fills underwritten roles with radiant star power."
The Public,"The problem is, there's only just enough story to go round. You can hear the creak as both characters and subplots get jacked up out of proportion."
The Public,"Its heart is in the right place, but because it's mired in too many of Estevez's questions about public duty versus public safety, The Public struggles to stay on track and keep the viewer involved."
The Public,"It's a noble effort, but ""The Public"" never makes a convincing case for its cause."
The Public,"Its presentation of real, painful issues is too simplistic and its approach too preachy."
The Public,"Estevez does an elegant job with this setup, creating a low-key, uncondescending portrait of lives on the edge."
The Public,Well-intentioned parable about the plight of the homeless falls flat.
The Public,"Estevez, directing himself, knows what emotions Estevez, the actor, is trying to put over. He's the only one."
The Public,"It's hard to disagree with anything in ""The Public."" Estevez is fighting the good fight. But it's also hard to swallow an argument, however well-reasoned and emotionally compelling, when it feels like it's being shoved down your throat."
The Public,"A clunky and at times ridiculous affair, taking a situation that might reasonably happen and turning it into something melodramatic and ultimately unbelievable."
The Public,"[A]n often implausible, stacked deck of social issues, contrived conflicts and feel-good activism."
The Public,"The film is a clunky, overwritten attempt to pack as many tortured subplots and pre-chewed sociological insights as can possibly fit into a two-hour runtime."
The Public,"Humorous, impactful and poignant. With a little extra tooling, it would also make a great Broadway play."
The Public,Consistently engages despite the relative obviousness of its dramatic tactics.
The Public,"The dialogue often has a stilted, unnatural ring to it, and it is a tribute to the cast that they manage to bring out the essence of the film, its political heart, so strongly."
The Chaperone,"All the corny romance stuff is about as intrinsic to the film’s soft appeal as the scrupulously well-made frocks, encompassing late Edwardian lace and flapper-style dropwaist numbers, and dozens of well-turned cloche hats."
The Chaperone,"If ""The Chaperone"" accomplishes anything, that will be to send viewers scrambling to Google to learn more about this extraordinary woman."
The Chaperone,"I'm not an Elizabeth McGovern completist, but it may be the best thing she's ever done."
The Chaperone,This is a coming-of-age story for both women. The title is fitting.
The Chaperone,"""The Chaperone"" is like telling the Tiger Woods story by choosing to focus on his first caddy. Sure, it's a way in, but unless that caddy has a really good story, what are we doing here?"
The Chaperone,"Norma's story, as handmaid to greatness, inevitably ends up feeling like we've explored a pleasant tributary, rather than the mainstream."
The Chaperone,"Between the speakeasies, the orphanages, the sexual energy, and the general air of corset-loosening, the movie should throb and thrum. It doesn't."
The Chaperone,"The focus isn't on the bratty flapper but McGovern's character's hesitant, poignant attempt to find out what she wants to be when she grows up, in a time and place where nobody wants her to be much of anything at all."
The Chaperone,"Despite the best efforts of McGovern et al., The Chaperone is lightweight trifle."
The Chaperone,"Because The Chaperone's second fiddle doesn't soak up the spotlight as readily as its star, the film leaves the viewer with an unsatisfied longing for more Brooks."
The Chaperone,"The film has a sedate TV-movie quality, unbefitting of the roaring era and its It Girl."
The Chaperone,"The movie does have an intelligent TV feel in its technique, with its focus on actors' faces and on acting moments that can be easily seen, even on a small screen."
The Chaperone,"Yet despite the stirring performance at its heart, the movie is ultimately too restricted by its own dramatic conventions, and it only seldom comes to life."
The Chaperone,"Self-actualization may be essential for people, but it doesn't always make for the best of drama."
The Chaperone,Masterpiece Theater's first foray into theaters argues that the venerable program should continue to showcase long-form television rather than expanding into a format for which it is ill-suited.
The Chaperone,"It's a small-scale movie, and no harm in that, but it's tidy and stagy in a fusty middlebrow way."
The Chaperone,"A film of uncommon rapture, albeit one with little of the noisy, fast-moving action contemporary audiences have come to expect."
The Chaperone,"What makes Engler's film worth a look, apart from its two leading ladies, is how it manages to make a tale set nearly a century ago feel oddly timely."
The Chaperone,"If it's too much to ask for a Richardson-starring Louise Brooks biopic, is it then too much ask for a true two-hander in which she and McGovern actually share the screen? Apparently, and sadly, yes."
The Chaperone,"While Norma awakens to fresh possibilities, her story remains a snooze."
The Chaperone,"Though Richardson is a delight, her verve and sexual confidence only highlight the dreariness around her. A light goes out whenever she's offscreen."
The Chaperone,It's little more than a handsome snooze that even the Masterpiece Theatre crowd may find a bit too snoozy.
The Chaperone,"Until the last half-hour, it's a rather plodding process of experimentation and assimilation as Norma gains the insight and courage to seize her dreams."
Nancy Drew and the Hidden S…,"Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase is a pleasing return to the kind of storytelling captured in those books, in which a mystery is tidily solved through logic and cleverness."
Nancy Drew and the Hidden S…,"Lillis shines as the brainy detective, but the movie itself is none too bright."
Nancy Drew and the Hidden S…,"Ineffectual, irrelevant and amateurishly conceived from start to finish, this movie is so bad it could kill off Nancy Drew forever."
Nancy Drew and the Hidden S…,"Lillis is ideally cast as Nancy, often cheerfully undercutting some of her character's more precocious proclamations, cracking smiles and reminding us that she's still a kid."
Nancy Drew and the Hidden S…,"[Lillis is] the freshest thing to happen to Nancy Drew in decades, making it clear that casting was the solution that has so often eluded this series in its jump from page to screen in the past."
Nancy Drew and the Hidden S…,"While most of the acting here is unexceptional and the direction/editing often reflects odd choices,... the movie's intended demographic of adolescent and teenage girls will likely not care."
Nancy Drew and the Hidden S…,The Hidden Staircase ultimately fails to introduce the younger members of its audience to the pleasures of movie detective.
Nancy Drew and the Hidden S…,"Clearly made by people who have thought through the material and tried to make it enjoyable and palatable, but the set-up at the end for further sequels feels a little too hopeful."
The Grizzlies,"Though it's a familiar plot about kids learning discipline and teamwork through sports, The Grizzlies is brought to life through the specifics that make the characters and their sense of place -- and of displacement -- central to the story."
The Grizzlies,It's exactly the type of uplifting movie that could boost spirits during these bleak times.
The Grizzlies,Bracingly unsentimental and transcendently moving at the same time.
The Grizzlies,"It's a fascinating puzzle: a film that is simultaneously an indictment of the toxic legacy of cultural imperialism and a weepie that employs the familiar tropes of Hollywood, one of the biggest machines of cultural imperialism on the planet."
More Than Blue,ERROR
Bennett’s War,"Modest but enjoyable, with some exciting race footage, it should provide an inviting alternative for audiences on the lookout for inspirational family-friendly fare..."
Bennett’s War,"Performances are generally competent, but nobody in the cast has the kind of presence needed to overcome Ranarivelo's by-the-numbers dialogue."
Bennett’s War,"""Bennett's War""... proves to be less of a battle than a test of endurance."
Climax,ERROR
Like Arrows,ERROR
The Fighting Preacher,"The Fighting Preacher, is a bit uneven but overall it succeeds in telling a sentimental true story about tolerance, kindness and how a Christian spirit will win over hate every time."
The Fighting Preacher,"The moments of sincerity and drama tend to work more consistently than the comic beats, but a strong character arc and an instructive message give ""Fighting Preacher's"" unique story some worthwhile meat"
The Fighting Preacher,"Christensen has explored early history of the church before, with pioneer tales like ""17 Miracles"" and ""Ephraim's Rescue,"" but here his focus is not on great accomplishments but small ones."
The Souvenir,The Souvenir Part II is undeniably the work of a talented director though this episode of the autobiography is less interesting than its predecessor.
The Souvenir,This is a creative coming-of-age story – a portrait of the artist as a young woman discovering her own voice.
The Souvenir,"Joanna Hogg delivers an object lesson in how to deliver a follow-up: deeper, funnier, more imaginative than its predecessor, The Souvenir Part II is a filmmaker working at the peak of her powers."
The Souvenir,"Think of it as The Godfather Part II of posh misery, a film built upon the emotional wreckage left behind from the original, yet wider in scope, smoother in execution, and with warmth where a freezer used to be."
The Souvenir,"It is painfully touching. You can’t tear your eyes from them. If there were to be The Souvenir Part III: Rosalind and James Walk Their Springer Spaniels, I would be up for that."
The Souvenir,Hogg has created her own universe and explored it with relentless vigour. Few final shots have so satisfactorily summed up such a magnum opus.
The Souvenir,The complete story ends up a valentine to the transformative power of cinema.
The Souvenir,"For the viewer, it feels less necessary, more of a coda... The film is beautifully made, and there are treasurable scenes."
The Souvenir,"Hogg captures something I've felt acutely as a female filmmaker: a desperate need for everyone to like you, which eliminates any possibility of their respect."
The Souvenir,Writer-director Joanna Hogg's artistic choices formulate something that isn't easily explained and is fathomable only in the viewing of it.
The Souvenir,"There's nothing actor-ish or mannered about Byrne. She doesn't even seem to be giving a performance, which underscores just how good a performance it actually is."
The Souvenir,Joanna Hogg's film treat a young artist's coming of age with disarming seriousness.
The Souvenir,"Like the original, the sequel makes the most of the very real mother-daughter dynamic."
The Souvenir,"It's less immediate than the first film, less cumulatively dramatic, but it flourishes in its complexity, in its depiction of the whole of Julie as she tries to focus her loss through her film school graduation project."
The Souvenir,"A delicate, somewhat maddeningly solipsistic portrait of a young artist discovering her voice and learning to fight for it."
The Souvenir,This portrait of the artist as a young woman is rich with detail and mystery and satisfaction...
The Souvenir,It'll leave you breathless.
The Souvenir,"The problem with ""Part II"" is that the film, like Julie, is adrift."
The Souvenir,"It's a specific character study told with the ambition that small, arty projects are rarely afforded -- a complex and deeply realized story that not only demanded a second film but actually got one."
The Souvenir,"For her new film, Hogg goes further, and in so doing makes one of 2021's best movies."
The Souvenir,"A beguilingly meta portrait of the artist as a young woman learning to find herself not just in the mirror of others, but in her own hand behind the camera."
The Souvenir,"The Souvenir Part II is a more buoyant, funnier film than its predecessor."
The Souvenir,"The entire construction of ""The Souvenir: Part II,"" the connection between its drama and Julie's student film, reflects an earnest and principled, if simplistic, didacticism about the pain and the privilege that allow aesthetic pleasure to be created."
The Souvenir,"More than anything, Hogg seems to be seeking a better understanding of the person she was at the time, with the films serving as a mirror that doesn't reverse her image, offering a fresh angle on a familiar reflection..."
The Souvenir,It's the 'almost-by-accident' quality (because of course it's not an accident at all) of Hogg's work that makes it unique.
The Souvenir,"As dazzled as I was by the performances in Part I, I was impatient with the meek, well-bred protagonist...Much of the joy here, in contrast, is in how this once-passive young woman plunges headlong into creative projects, friendships, & romantic dalliances."
The Souvenir,The film gets far more compelling when Julie essentially stages the events of The Souvenir as her thesis short.
The Souvenir,"The best kind of sequel, not merely enhancing or deepening its predecessor but also recasting it in a revelatory new light."
The Souvenir,"Ms. Hogg has outdone herself with an even stronger film about grief, self-discovery, the daunting uncertainties of the creative process and, before and after everything else, the mysterious power of the movie medium."
The Souvenir,"Movies about moviemaking are rarely as interesting as their makers think, but Julie's process does illuminate the character and Hogg's autobiographical intentions."
The Souvenir,"Art and life speedily evolve as one, the possibility of renewal and change demonstrated in practice."
The Souvenir,It's one of the most beautiful and extraordinary films of the year.
The Souvenir,"Searching, leftfield, strange and imaginative -- you could call The Souvenir Part II all those things. It's also sensitive and funny."
The Souvenir,"It's funnier than the original, and looser, too."
The Souvenir,"Joanna Hogg's The Souvenir: Part II is an extremely satisfying sequel to her 1980s-set memoir about a naive young film student falling under the thrall of an oppressive older man, Anthony."
The Souvenir,"Joanna Hogg's film is a work of understated warmth, profound emotional complexity, and eminently British dry humor."
The Souvenir,The Souvenir Part II has a meta-movie component that distinguishes it from its predecessor.
The Souvenir,"In the masterful The Souvenir: Part II [Hogg] continues to sculpt Julie's path with kindness, lovingly allowing her character to confront the paralyzing shadow that grief casts over her."
The Souvenir,"A masterwork of self-introspection through the canvas of cinema, ""The Souvenir: Part II"" is a meta epic of delicate proportions that constantly folds into itself."
The Souvenir,"[T]his A24 release deftly extracts something real and relatable from the elaborate artifice of the filmmaking process, making amusing observations about both the academic and the commercial sides."
The Souvenir,"This second part is lighter, more playful, growing in confidence along with its protagonist, in a terrific performance from Byrne. But it's also full of gentle, cherished acts of memory... A memorable experience, indeed."
The Souvenir,"Joanna Hogg has given us an amazingly luminous self-portrait of the film-maker as a young woman: metatextual, confessional and autobiographical."
The Souvenir,"Evidence of [Hoggs'] intention to own this portrait of the artist as a young, bereaved woman arrives in a perfectly judged finale, where Hogg's own voice has the final word."
The Souvenir,"A mild case of sequelitis has infected the film-maker Joanna Hogg, who follows her devastating and award-winning drama from 2019, The Souvenir, with this rigorously shot, intellectually cogent, but ultimately vacant companion piece."
The Souvenir,This is moving and very evocative filmmaking.
The Souvenir,"It's a beguiling work from a master of her craft that holds the art of filmmaking in its piercing gaze, and speaks to an uncompromising vision of what cinema can be with a little faith and imagination."
The Souvenir,"A film to savour, visually and sensorily."
The Souvenir,"Like ""The Souvenir"" itself (both parts of it), Byrne's performance gains its power from a steady accumulation of small glimmers."
The Souvenir,"Nevertheless, this is a witty, fitfully intriguing sequel that's a good fit for Cannes: Hogg may be the most French director to come out of England."
The Souvenir,"Everything is fine and nothing is right in Joanna Hogg's film, a dazzling, fragile follow-up to her semi-autobiographical coming-of-age stunner from 2019..."
All is True,It's almost like Shakespeare wrote this movie.
All is True,"The movie's impressive appearance notwithstanding, Shakespeare's domestic problems do not a classic make."
All is True,"Apart from fleeting pleasures, All Is True is mostly a goodie bag stuffed for Shakespeare completists."
All is True,"But mostly what ""All is True"" does is give viewers is a fresh look at Shakespeare, behind the guise, flaws and all. And if ever there was a man for that job, it's Branagh."
All is True,"""All is True"" is expertly acted and handsomely filmed but suffers from an excess of sentimentality, a rash of revelations, and a surfeit of subtext, with characters blurting out the hidden motives for their behavior instead of simply behaving them."
All is True,"A fake schnoz significantly alters Branagh's appearance as the Bard of Avon, but his career-long interest in Shakespeare shines through."
All is True,"In All Is True Branagh and Elton do what the Bard did himself: take something-be it someone else's idea, an historical fact, or a recent event-and mash it up with original material, to fashion an entertainment that feels real."
All is True,"Ultimately, it's a bit on-the-nose, and the disconnect between Shakespeare's genius for character and his befuddled attempts at personal relationships makes for a man too bifurcated to believe, as if the fire that gutted the Globe also burned his brain."
All is True,"Branagh's performance is a minor miracle, building a poignant portrait of a man whose painful and belated acquisition of self-knowledge finally saves him and enriches everybody around him. If Shakespeare wasn't like this, he should have been."
All is True,"""All is True"" shows a better eye and a less fussy, more purposeful sense of rhythm and pacing than all but one or two of the Shakespeare adaptations Branagh has brought to the screen."
All is True,[A]n intriguing speculative drama about the playwright's final years.
All is True,"Given the impossibility of crafting William Shakespeare into a believable human being, the film is an honorable try."
All is True,Kenneth Branagh... bungles All is True worse than Malvolio with a letter from Olivia...
All is True,"How do you make a legend as imposing as Shakespeare flesh? ""All Is True"" suggests you can't, if not even Branagh, Dench, McKellen, et al. can bring him down to earth."
All is True,"This is an intelligently-scripted, beautifully evoked speculation, a modest drama played out in a minor key."
All is True,"The women suffer under hats the size of fire hydrants. The music is mostly scored for piano and mush. And our attention is drawn, at inordinate length, to landscapes that look too fanciful to be rooted in the real."
All is True,"Branagh's easy-on-the-eyes (and the ears) drama... offers enough small, detail-rich pleasures to make it worth checking out."
All is True,"Purists may have a field day with All Is True, and it does have a tendency to lag, but I found myself thinking about it days after I'd seen it."
All is True,"The screenplay, by Ben Elton, wasn't woven from whole cloth. But its inventions and speculations aren't very interesting. Nowhere do they hint at the man who gave us the plays"
All is True,"Between them, Branagh and Elton have concocted a respectful story of loss, regret and wistful genius."
All is True,"in a mesmerizing meditation on Shakespeare's last days, director-star Kenneth Branagh shuns the idea of the Bard as a literary rock star to find the flawed, touchingly human man inside."
All is True,"Solid, creative melodrama is nothing to sneeze at, but it can't compete with enduring genius."
All is True,"It's an unfussy, intimate chamber drama that's fearless in confronting the attitudes of its exalted subject."
All is True,Dramatically it works.
All is True,"Branagh casts himself as the beloved ""Will"" (of course), playing him with a convincingly world-weary edge, while Judi Dench stars as his wife, Anne Hathaway."
All is True,I found it very touching.
All is True,"A charming, surprisingly salty take on a story that ... is told less often than one might expect."
All is True,"For Branagh's part, despite that initially offputting prosthetic, as Shakespeare he delivers every nuance."
All is True,"This is leaden, lifeless, sentimental and afflicted by too many sub-plots that just don't go anywhere."
All is True,"All Is True is a mellow, bustling, sweet-natured literary biopic."
All is True,"A quiet and meditative portrait of the artist as a retiree, this lacks incident or high stakes but has an elegiac feeling of regret and reckoning that fits its subject's twilight years."
All is True,"Iit's the absence of grandstanding, of Stoppardian showing off, that makes this film different, as a lovely meditation on what parts of a man's legacy truly matter."
All is True,"It dodges the pitfalls of luvviedom and period camp to produce a fiercely intelligent and poignant drama about family, grief and the tyranny of genius."
All is True,"Slowly, as the thematic center of the film begins to take shape, so does Branagh's character - and in those moments the audience is treated to what amounts to nothing short of a Christmas gift for any Anglophile or Shakespeare lover."
All is True,Forget all of it being true; I would have settled for some of it being interesting.
All is True,"A tender, intelligent imagining of the playwright in retirement."
All is True,A serviceable take on the Bard's latter days.
All is True,"Alas, rather than model itself on Shakespeare's own history plays, which carefully select and structure events with an eye toward plot and theme, All Is True is an overstuffed mess."
All is True,"The result is a revisionist fiasco, too dense with Shakespeare allusions for casual moviegoers, and too fast and loose with the facts for those who know a thing or two about the man."
All is True,"All Is True is sentimental, theatrical, likable - and unfashionable."
All is True,"In this lovely ode to a literary master, Branagh shows us what his hero always understood - that life may be an endlessly unfolding mystery, but in art, all is true."
All is True,"Watching Branagh and McKellen in gently dueling versions of Sonnet 29 provides that pleasure; the rest of ""All Is True,"" unfortunately, strains to honor its beloved subject."
El Chicano,It does have some riveting moments and some very strong acting.
El Chicano,"Ben Hernandez Bray's ""El Chicano"" seldom amounts to anything more than a crude prototype for the kind of Latinx-driven superhero movies that Marvel and DC should already be making by now."
El Chicano,"When your lead actor doesn't seem to be having any fun in an action movie, there's not much left for audiences to cling to. Genre fans will need to look elsewhere for their gunslinger fix."
El Chicano,"This is a nasty, brutal little movie, more in the vein of a grindhouse revenge flick than anything else. But it's effectively done..."
El Chicano,[El Chicano] functions most effectively when it explores the dangers of moral ambiguity.
El Chicano,"Like in this year's remake of Miss Bala, the Mexicans in this movie are the bad guys, the drug-running cartel members ruining it for the rest of us in the United States."
El Chicano,The problem here isn't the fairly apparent budgetary limits - it's the limitations of style and imagination.
El Chicano,"It's dull and banal, coasting on familiarity from beginning to end. Here, the clichés don't celebrate a reunion. They're at war."
El Chicano,"""El Chicano"" stands as a solidly acted and technically accomplished spectacle, the latter likely the result of Hernandez Bray's time delivering stunt magic behind the scenes as a stunt coordinator."
El Chicano,"Throughout, the film peddles notions of self-realization and self-actualization that feel nothing short of moth-eaten."
El Chicano,"There's a need for a Latino superhero film. ""El Chicano"" is not it."
El Chicano,It's hard to be entertained by the spectacle of brutality when campiness is entirely absent.
El Chicano,Mainly a violent police procedural and vigilante drama that succeeds well enough on those terms.
El Chicano,"Diego... lacks any nuance as a character. He is grim and humorless, like most everything else about this film."
After the Wedding,[It] doesn't fully trust its own story and tries to dress it up with an air of ominous mystery that winds up undercutting the drama rather than adding to it.
After the Wedding,"The film's top-notch cast are let down badly enough by the clunking screenplay, but they are entirely defeated by the ethical vacuum at its core."
After the Wedding,"The Sad Rich White People Movie is one of my favourite genres, and indeed the white people in this English-language remake of Danish film-maker's Susanne Bier's 2006 tearjerker are very sad and very rich."
After the Wedding,"For all of After the Wedding's narrative twists and turns, there's nothing here that feels close to earth-shaking."
After the Wedding,"Something about the story feels patly subservient, as if the film had no urgent issue to address but some good actors available to emote on cue."
After the Wedding,"The mystery has been dialled down, the treacle dialled up, and what we are left with is basically Eat Pray Love 2."
After the Wedding,"The plot's soap opera twists should jerk tears but director Bart Freundlich leaves you high and dry, as if too classy to admit his own film's silliness."
After the Wedding,A limp and forgettable narrative gives us little to hold on to.
After the Wedding,"When a story earns it, most of us are happy to give up some tears; this one only thinks it does. That kills emotion, offering a facsimile of drama rather than the real thing."
After the Wedding,"Character judgments aside, ""After the Wedding"" wants emotional fireworks but comes up with duds."
After the Wedding,After the Wedding doesn't so much as skip among its four main characters as arc and gyrate and generate emotional torque. It's intense - you break a sweat just keeping up.
After the Wedding,"There's a clumsiness here, a succession of setups and awkward payoffs that are so on-the-nose, so cringe-inducingly earnest, that it's hard not to laugh."
After the Wedding,The movie's biggest issue blooms from its core: it doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it wants to be.
After the Wedding,"For a supposed tearjerker, this film is so tone-deaf my guess is there won't be a wet eye in the house."
After the Wedding,A beautifully acted drama with a tantalizing mystery at its center.
After the Wedding,"Is ""After the Wedding"" a great movie? No, not especially. Are these two women treasures of cinema? Absolutely."
After the Wedding,"After the Wedding is competently made and appealing in an exaggerated soap opera-tinged fashion but, as is often the case with remakes, the original is the stronger version and the next generation version fails to make a strong case for its raison d'être."
After the Wedding,"After the Wedding went from being the Sundance 2019 opener to an August leftover, which may tell you all you need to know."
After the Wedding,"There's a lot to be admired here, and ""After the Wedding"" certainly gives you a lot to think about. It just doesn't quite make you feel all the feels."
After the Wedding,Freundlich's version... flips the genders of the story's two main characters but does little else to justify the time and resources spent on remaking Bier's world.
After the Wedding,"These women are powerhouses, and ""After the Wedding"" lets them share the screen. It's impossible to dislike a movie that does that."
After the Wedding,[A] mesmerizing double master class in acting.
After the Wedding,"It's okay, but given all who is in it, you'd have reason to have high expectations."
After the Wedding,"Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams shine in After the Wedding, in which questions about philanthropy, good intentions, and romantic honesty are all under consideration."
After the Wedding,Freundlich's script keeps hopscotching right past the good stuff.
After the Wedding,"As a director, Bart Freundlich knows how to frame a scene and enhance visual beauty with a sharper edge, but his writing leaves gaps in the plot that raise more questions about logic than he satisfactorily answers."
After the Wedding,"This movie muses gracefully on its moral opportunities. In the end, though, it plumps for the lobster."
After the Wedding,"Writer-director Bart Freundlich's American remake of Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier's Oscar-nominated 2006 family drama is curiously bloodless, despite the enticing tweak of gender-reversing the primary roles."
After the Wedding,"If the script's epiphanies don't feel quite as shocking or profound the second time around, it's still pleasing to watch these beautiful, troubled people move through their equally beautiful spaces..."
After the Wedding,"If this redo is slick and shallow, it's nonetheless meticulously constructed and entirely watchable, with only a few histrionic moments."
After the Wedding,"A supreme example of classed-up mediocrity, ""After the Wedding,"" a pointless remake of Susanne Bier's 2007 melodrama of the same name, offers little that's new and a lot that's predictable, even to first-time viewers."
After the Wedding,"After The Wedding saddles its cast with a hackneyed script calibrated for high melodrama, only to punt in favor of cheap sentimentality."
After the Wedding,The film diverts us away from its hint of a social message using a series of tired twists and turns that don't signify much of anything.
After the Wedding,"We're waiting for this pressure cooker of a scenario to go nuclear and spill gunk all over the pretty, expensive stuff. It never quite happens and, for all the actors' impeccable restraint, something is missing."
After the Wedding,"The surprises are among the few pleasures in this ultimately forgettable, small film."
After the Wedding,"Viewed on its own terms, the remake does competent lip-service to the original."
After the Wedding,For a film punctuated with emotion... After the Wedding sadly doesn't provoke much within the viewer.
After the Wedding,"Freundlich's American remake of the Bier film flips the gender of the main characters, yielding predictably strong performances from Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams but otherwise removing the teeth..."
After the Wedding,The rare remake that honors the original but also finds its own reason for existing.
After the Wedding,"After a point, the twists come so steadily that I actually found myself holding my breath for long stretches - despite the fact that I know the original well - eager to see how key revelations would play out within this new dynamic."
After the Wedding,"It would be difficult to invest in if not for its two main stars who work hard to elevate the overly engineered plot, filling in the emotional gaps left by the haphazard script."
Red Joan,"Every plot point and every character insight gets delivered with the same manufactured smoothness; the movie is naggingly bland in the way one associates with ""respectable"" British cinema."
Red Joan,"In technical terms, it's a proficiently made film by the evergreen Trevor Nunn -- or it would be if it were not so determined to embrace all the cliches of the moment, both about British spies and films for women."
Red Joan,"This period drama is stuffy and slow, told in a clumsy way to justify Dench's casting and presence, and is still a waste of her time."
Red Joan,Although the story sounds fascinating - subterfuge! centrifuge! pinkos! - the film is cold fusion.
Red Joan,"Red Joan stands for nothing, and it's all the duller for failing to find even the slightest spike in this tale of duplicity."
Red Joan,"Dench, in her limited screen time, gives us tantalizing hints of who this weary-looking woman, slumped by the weight of secrets, might be."
Red Joan,...most of Dame Judi's scenes are quick and a criminal waste of her talent.
Red Joan,"For a movie about an intelligent female Cambridge science student and communist sympathizer, this movie sounds interesting. Too bad it is awfully dull."
Red Joan,"The sentimental treatment that director Trevor Nunn adopts seems misplaced, almost crazy in its subjectivity."
Red Joan,"Dench delivers some fine speeches in defence of her character's younger days, but her role is exceedingly limited."
Red Joan,Dench is a triple agent but Nunn squanders her talents. What a betrayal.
Red Joan,"The storytelling, like the beige-heavy cinematography that takes its cues from liver spots and tea-stained dentures, could do with a bit more colour."
Red Joan,"The result is a film which, although very handsomely made, has little dramatic intensity."
Red Joan,"How do you bring the legendary stage director Trevor Nunn together with the peerless screen icon Judi Dench, hand them a real-life wartime spy story that's full of sex and intrigue, and a race to build a nuclear bomb, yet still, somehow, end up with this?"
Red Joan,"A strange, bifurcated tale of love and espionage, with Judi Dench stuck in a thankless role that does nothing to capitalize on her talents. The film is worse for it."
Red Joan,"Uneven it may be, Red Joan still emanates a memorable essence, one that's refreshingly and believably feminine."
Red Joan,"Cookson is very good, but she's too often left to perform in a vacuum. Lindsay Shapero's script - based on Jennie Rooney's novel - neglects to build in the tension Cookson clearly aims to generate."
Red Joan,"It takes a quality - not a gift exactly, but a quality - to make something so boring of such a fascinating subject."
Red Joan,We're left with a mediocre mash-up of an old-fashioned spy movie and the story of a son coping with the sins of his mother.
Red Joan,"But it's not only its generic elements and sporadic listlessness that hampers ""Red Joan,"" it's that the film's attempts to convince us of the rightness of her actions don't succeed either."
Red Joan,"It's a simplistic take on a potentially fascinating subject: right cast, wrong film."
Red Joan,"What should be breathless and urgent is instead polite and listless: if you can't ignite sparks from an illicit bathroom assignation, then maybe espionage just isn't your thing."
Red Joan,"Directed by theatre legend Sir Trevor Nunn, it's as dusty as an old filing cabinet and only a tad more thrilling to watch."
Red Joan,"Despite strong performances from Cookson and Dench, this potentially exciting espionage tale is dreary and forgettable."
Red Joan,"Quite simply, there is not enough Dench, not enough Old Joan, not enough about how she feels about the decades of deceit, and tension, and becalmed ordinariness, far from the drama of espionage."
Red Joan,"Perhaps too cosy for its serious subject matter, but remains very watchable nevertheless."
Red Joan,Her story might make a compelling film - but it isn't this one...
Red Joan,It's all about as tense as a gentle punt down the Cam.
Red Joan,"It's always dangerous to wonder about what a film might have been rather than contending with what it is, but in this case what it is, is so bland, and so stolidly workmanlike in execution..."
Red Joan,"Dench lends emotional heft and nuance to her handful of scenes, but Red Joan is otherwise let down by leaden dialogue and one-note characters."
Red Joan,"Most of the fun in Red Joan comes from such overthrown expectations, so it's a shame that the film itself fails to overwhelm - mostly proceeding along dully familiar lines and anything but radical."
Red Joan,A taut old-school thriller with a modern heroine.
Red Joan,"A would-be sweeping epic that instead turns out tweedy, dreary, and unconvincing."
Red Joan,"Solidly competent and, for the most part, well acted..."
The Aftermath,ERROR
Wild Rose,"The film itself makes for a marvelous evening, a tribute to great performers, to humble beginnings, to home, and to the power of a well-crafted story, poured through a generational talent."
Wild Rose,"Wild Rose is never particularly surprising, but it's a familiar story renewed in a satisfyingly female-focused way."
Wild Rose,"The movie is like an old honky-tonk song, a little sentimental but full of heart. It torches and twangs without getting too hokey."
Wild Rose,"""Wild Rose"" is singing a different tune. Just don't be surprised when it winds up getting stuck in your head."
Wild Rose,Wild Rose is just plain lovely.
Wild Rose,"...perhaps a little too tidily by the end, Wild Rose nonetheless feels authentic."
Wild Rose,"When the story shifts to Nashville, the screenplay by Nicole Taylor takes some sharp and insightful turns..."
Wild Rose,Buckley's unusually unguarded expressions give viewers entry into her character's every thought.
Wild Rose,"In ""Wild Rose,"" that heartbreak can - and does - become something beautiful."
Wild Rose,Buckley... confirms that she is a specialist in the untamed.
Wild Rose,"To call Wild Rose a feel-good triumph feels reductive, but it literally makes you feel good and smile. How can you argue with that?"
Wild Rose,"Wild Rose features one of the best lead performances of the year, Jessie Buckley as Rose-Lynn. This one is absolutely brimming with energy and heart, and rocks one particularly unforgettable original song that better get some love this awards season."
Wild Rose,Jessie Buckley is unbelievably great in this crowd-pleasing fable...
Wild Rose,"It's saved from overfamiliarity by a welcome swerve in the final reel, and the visceral, raw-nerved life force that Buckley radiates in nearly every frame."
Wild Rose,"Wild Rose may sound like a familiar tune, but you've never heard it performed quite like this."
Wild Rose,"Ms. Buckley brings her own truth to this mostly synthetic confection, and it's a beautiful thing to behold."
Wild Rose,"Buckley has bags of pugnacious charisma and a soaring, throaty singing voice tempered with enough vulnerability to make us want to hold her close even as the screw-up she offers us drives everyone in her orbit up the wall."
Wild Rose,"A dynamic, inspiring tale of setbacks and unexpected victories, set to a vibrant, raucous country soundtrack full of old classics and new original songs."
Wild Rose,"Wild Rose is a film that gives birth to a brand new star named Jessie Buckley, and she absolutely deserves all of your undivided, not-remotely-built-for-plus-30-C attention."
Wild Rose,"Taylor's script is plausibly grounded in the rhythms of day-to-day family life, in the tough realities of cramped apartments, meager paychecks and broken promises."
Wild Rose,Buckley [is] an incandescent onscreen presence with a set of killer pipes who imbues every song with undeniable heart.
Wild Rose,This story of a Scottish single mother who dreams of country-music glory is fueled by one knockout performance from Jessie Buckley. Prepare for an emotional wipeout.
Wild Rose,"Rose-Lynn is neither a wholly selfish character nor a selfless one, and her rough contours give Wild Rose-directed by Tom Harper and written by Nicole Taylor-its bite."
Wild Rose,"Doing her own singing, Buckley is a rich, startling vocalist who if anything seems to under-excite the crowds she performs for. Yet she is also persuasive as a reluctant, unreliable parent."
Wild Rose,"It's a tailor-made role for the electrifying Buckley, an actor who communicates pure primal instinct with a startling immediacy. As Rose-Lynn, she communicates every emotion physically, on her face, in her body and her voice."
Wild Rose,A unique and gritty spin on the rising-star genre.
Wild Rose,"Buckley supercharges Wild Rose with electrifying purpose, adding flair and substance to the screenwriter Nicole Taylor's routine but solid script about a diamond in the rough."
Wild Rose,"Buckley's voice is like a sugar cube dissolving in a glass of whiskey, sweet enough to bring tears to your eyes with a throaty aftertaste that lingers after she's belted out the last note."
Wild Rose,"But even as the script strums the same three chords, Jessie Buckley always tells the truth."
Wild Rose,Tom Harper's film empathetically probes the growing pains of self-improvement.
Wild Rose,"A stirring, dynamic, and joyously unexpected coming-of-age tale with a potentially star-making performance from lead Jessie Buckley."
Wild Rose,"A rousing mix of new and old, with the irrepressible Buckley seizing every song as if born to it."
Wild Rose,"With a voice of fire and stardust, Buckley sings of shiny hopes, hidden heartaches and rawest revelations, creating a journey that's heartwarming, pulse racing and toe-tapping."
Wild Rose,"From its opening notes, ""Wild Rose"" puts a lump in your throat as you realize you're watching a star being born"
Wild Rose,This is an upbeat project fuelled by anger.
Wild Rose,"A rousing, crowd-pleasing movie that promises to set hearts and heels pounding."
Wild Rose,"To the enormous credit of the writing, you never know, for one second, whether she's going to make it or not. There are no stock characters here."
Wild Rose,Wild Rose has plenty of gentle and ironic humour along the way.
Wild Rose,"Wild Rose tries its best, with almost wall-to-wall tap-along country ditties and a gushing, gurning, stage-set finale. It's not enough, though."
Wild Rose,See it. Have fun. Come back in a month for the sing-along version.
Wild Rose,"True, there are clichéd moments. And predictable moments. And the ending is pat and sentimental, and has it all ways, but her energy whizzes you past all that."
Wild Rose,"It is no sombre lecture; with Buckley giving a breathtaking, force-of-nature performance, it becomes an uplifting tale about the benefits of reshaping your dreams to fit your circumstances."
Wild Rose,"Finally, it's the marrying of Rose-Lynn's country ethos with her own struggle - as far removed as Glasgow might seem from snakeskin and cowboy hats - that makes everything click into place."
Wild Rose,Jessie Buckley... makes a mighty impact in Wild Rose.
Wild Rose,Rising star Jessie Buckley rocks in this home-grown answer to A Star Is Born.
Wild Rose,Taylor deftly nails the dramatic beats. More admirable still is her willingness to keep the sharp edges of her story intact.
Wild Rose,"This is a sentimental, faintly unreal story: very well sung."
Wild Rose,A star is born? More like a supernova.
Wild Rose,A seemingly well-worn narrative becomes a more interesting look at the responsibilities and rights of being a mother with a dream.
Wild Rose,"A real foot-stomper, carried by spirited performances from Buckley, Walters and Okonedo."
Wild Rose,A beautiful story told with a huge amount of tenderness and love for its unconventional heroine. Jessie Buckley is one of the brightest stars in our sky right now.
Wild Rose,"Finding balance between what you've done and what you feel destined to do resonates beyond country music. When the film sings, it soars - Jessie Buckley was born to be a star."
Wild Rose,"A happy-sad drama of starstruck fever that lifts you up and sweeps you along, touching you down in a puddle of well-earned tears."
Wild Rose,"Entirely delightful, fresh as a Scottish summer evening."
Wild Rose,Much will be made of former musical reality show contestant Buckley's phenomenal performances. But it's as an actor that her RADA-trained register impresses the most.
The Other Side of Heaven 2:…,A blandly sincere and sluggishly paced drama about a Mormon missionary's return to the South Pacific.
The Other Side of Heaven 2:…,"Everything is so extreme here-the storms, the score, the pouring of emotions-that a moment of subtlety is welcome by comparison."
The White Crow,The White Crow winds up falling short as a respectable but not-quite-inspired portrait of an extraordinary talent.
The White Crow,"I am found myself fairly taken in with this just as a [straightforward], good, sensible drama."
The White Crow,"The White Crow offers up all these elements of Nureyev - his past, his heat, his vulnerabilities - but all those parts are dancing around each other incongruously rather than as a well-choreographed ensemble piece."
The White Crow,"The Nureyev story is a very good one, and Fiennes and Hare tell it well."
The White Crow,"The film gives the impression that much of Fiennes' attention went into working with Ivenko on shaping the details of this portrait -- and it is psychologically convincing, whether or not it has much to do with the real man."
The White Crow,"Fiennes' drab biopic of Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev drains the color from his life, and comes across as cold as a Soviet winter."
The White Crow,As a dance film-another genre that all too often disappoints-The White Crow gets many things right.
The White Crow,"Ultimately, ""The White Crow"" seems tailored to appeal to moviegoers who are already fans of Nureyev's idiosyncratic dancing and want to know more about how it got that way."
The White Crow,"The film may go to lengths to tell us that Nureyev was sensational to watch, but we don't experience much of this power or magnetism as viewers."
The White Crow,"It's a movie full of small pleasures, such as the Polaroid-ish softness of the cinematography, Fiennes' quietly noble performance as Nureyev's mentor Pushkin, and the glimpses of the ballet studios..."
The White Crow,"Unless you have a special interest in Nureyev, Russian ballet, or the Cold War's impact on the arts at mid-century, ""The White Crow"" might be something better heard about than experienced."
The White Crow,"It's astonishing that this is Ivenko's first movie role, because he projects Nureyev's drive, seductiveness, intellectual curiosity, imperiousness, vulnerability, and mercurial temper with a naturalism that seems effortless."
The White Crow,"Not exactly a warts-and-all artist biopic. It's more an account of the way that the artistic spirit is a wart, a strange affliction that besets certain people even as it fascinates others."
The White Crow,"It's a good movie, so smartly directed by Ralph Fiennes, who also appears as Nureyev's dance instructor, that at times it feels like an IQ test. But the story is intriguing and, ultimately, gripping enough to overcome all that."
The White Crow,"While the details of Nureyev's 1961 defection in Paris are thrilling, the film falls into the trap of many historical dramas, rendering the story as surprisingly clunky, especially considering the nimbleness of its subjects."
The White Crow,"The White Crow fitfully does justice to Nureyev's overwhelming desire to be an artist, and that's not a negligible achievement."
The White Crow,Director Ralph Fiennes makes this hypnotic look into the young life of controversial ballet icon Rudolph Nureyev (Oleg Ivenko) a thing of bruised beauty and an exhilarating gift.
The White Crow,"Some viewers will find the result too fussy by half; I liked its restlessness, and the sense of a chafed and driven spirit that refuses to be boxed in."
The White Crow,"Subject and style could not be more different than in ""The White Crow,"" but that fusion of opposites has resulted in an involving biographical drama that rarely puts a foot wrong."
The White Crow,"If you didn't know why he was considered a transcendent dancer or a transformational figure, you still won't know after the final credits roll."
The White Crow,"Unlike its subject, The White Crow is ultimately forgettable."
The White Crow,Ralph Fiennes's film too conspicuously avoids an overt political perspective.
The White Crow,"Ivenko, who bears a strong resemblance to Nureyev, is transfixing, as well as Fiennes and Khamatova. The performances, and the beautifully captured moments of dance, are strong enough to outshine any weak story elements."
The White Crow,"It becomes unclear whether we are even supposed to root for Rudolf, or if it matters that we do."
The White Crow,"Fiennes gives a hypnotic performance as Nureyev's favourite teacher, Alexander Pushkin."
The White Crow,"There are moments of greatness here - in the climax of the final act, the defection itself - where the direction is as lean and agile as any of the dancers."
The White Crow,The sound of the dancing puts you right there in the room.
The White Crow,"If The White Crow is occasionally a little bit clumsy, its spirit is perfect."
The White Crow,"One of the fascinations of the film, elegantly scripted by playwright David Hare, is the mixture of storytelling styles."
The White Crow,"Fiennes's direction never puts the ""rush"" into Russian. It is all too delicate and hesitant."
The White Crow,"A serious-minded, often beautiful, utterly heartfelt character study that nevertheless lacks its astonishing protagonist's fleet-footedness and only partly captures what made him tick."
The White Crow,An oblique take on an icon that leaves you hungry for more.
The White Crow,"An athletic, confident, undemanding film."
The White Crow,"An explicatory exercise in dot-joining, the ultimate goal being to plot a psychological course from point A to point B."
The White Crow,"An interesting, challenging mess. The White Crow offers lots that's impressive - Ivenko as Nureyev, the dance sequences, a knuckle-whitening last 20 minutes - but can't render it in a dramatically engaging way."
The White Crow,[An] imperfect but engrossing biopic.
The White Crow,The narrative bounces all over the place trying to cover too much ground when concentrating on the core drama would have far better served the desired end.
The White Crow,A classy - and respectfully sexy - night at the movies.
The White Crow,"The cluttered structure, littered with brusque little flashbacks, repeatedly interrupts the momentum and tension of the story of Nureyev's most daring leap."
Arctic,"First-time feature director Joe Penna and his cowriter and editor Ryan Morrison skillfully exploit genre conventions, but suspense arises mostly from what fresh hells they devise for the hero to conquer, for conquer he must."
Arctic,"Brazilian director Joe Penna, a former viral YouTube star, seems to relish the chance to stretch out and slow down, training the focus of his almost John Carpenter-esque feature debut (shot in gorgeous Icelandic locations) on small acts of process."
Arctic,"It's an austere approach, but Brazilian-born Joe Penna, directing his first film after making a splash with his videos on YouTube, is to be commended for the rigorousness with which he is operating."
Arctic,[Mikkelsen] brings a level of intense physicality that is coupled with a level of emotive sensitivity that's superb.
Arctic,"Arctic, a chilly and straightforward story of survival."
Arctic,"Mikkelsen gives a strong performance, of course. He has to carry the movie on his shoulders, but that's probably why he did it."
Arctic,"This film makes for a compelling hour and a half; you know where it's going, but you never quite believe it'll actually get there."
Arctic,"Though the journey is well executed and the tension sustained, the obstacles are so familiar to the genre - inclement weather, tricky rock formations, grumpy bears - they can feel ordinary."
Arctic,"The actor offers an incredibly committed and determined performance, but by the film's end, you wish he'd be able to get back to doing what he does best: eating."
Arctic,Arctic is a one-man showcase for the acting that we know Mads Mikkelsen is capable of. The film's power comes from his performance.
Arctic,It would be easier to count the words spoken in Joe Penna's survival thriller Arctic than the number of beats your heart skips while watching it.
Arctic,"""Arctic"" is a film for all seasons."
Arctic,"[N]ot once, not even for a moment, do we lose interest in Mikkelsen, or stop caring about what happens to him, or cease to believe him."
Arctic,"Arctic tells this story of self-reliance and survival with such austerity and absolute integrity that the results are breathtaking, even in the moments where the movie seems to amble forward at a glacial pace."
Arctic,The movie really takes your mind off your own troubles. I liked it a lot.
Arctic,"""Arctic"" is a lesson in lessness, coolly observed and warmly felt."
Arctic,Arctic lacks what makes for the best movies of its ilk: it does not inspire much imagination concerning what our hero might do first if he does get back home.
Arctic,A fine reminder of how cinematic language can and should transcend the spoken word... a meticulous portrait of survival and human determination.
Arctic,"The simple yet intense scenario makes Arctic a taut, cohesive exercise for Penna and editor and co-writer Ryan Morrison. It's also a fine showcase for Mikkelsen, playing a man who's resourceful but no more heroic than he needs to be."
Arctic,"Though it's not anything new in terms of dramatic representation, in its solidly visceral execution - stressing a belief in filmmaking's basic tools of storytelling that's almost refreshing - it earns its place among the genre's stalwarts."
Arctic,"""Arctic"" has the courage to avoid obvious payoffs."
Arctic,"Stirring cinematography by Tómas Örn Tómasson, who captures the film's stark Icelandic location with sweep and dazzle, plus an evocatively pensive, strings-heavy score by Joseph Trapanese, rounds out this enervating and exhilarating film."
Arctic,The film has a raw immediacy that can only be achieved when most cinematic excesses have been eliminated.
Arctic,Mads Mikkelsen's virtuoso performance as a downed pilot trying to survive in the harshest of environments is the warm heart of this ice-cold killer of a movie.
Arctic,"When the gamble is man vs. nature, the smart bet is almost always on the house. Unless the man is Mads Mikkelsen..."
Arctic,"Arctic doesn't have a long-lasting impact. Without artistry and an indelible atmospheric impression, it's just another film you'll vaguely remember."
Arctic,[A] minimalist and ultimately disappointing story of survival in the wilderness.
Arctic,"Yet with barely any dialogue, traditional storytelling methods or even a cute pet or inanimate object to help, director Joe Penna and star Mads Mikkelsen have made a riveting and precisely plotted film worthy of other greats in the genre."
Arctic,The latest entry in the hackneyed lone-survivor genre offers little to revitalize it.
Arctic,"Mads gets to show an intense vulnerability for once. That's worth seeing, though one wishes Arctic complicated its life-and-death ordeal a little more, or at least varied its obstacles."
Arctic,"This is Penna's debut feature, and he has set himself a high bar which he just about scrapes over, with Mikkelsen giving the entire project a super-strength leg up."
Arctic,"It's broad stuff, and well-trod terrain for a movie that takes place in uncharted territory, but it cuts straight to the difference between endurance and survival."
Arctic,Mikkelsen takes commanding centre stage in a guilty-pleasure survival drama with global ambitions.
Arctic,"Arctic is stark and visceral, stripped of any distracting elements, and for the survival movie purist, it's an artful entry into the genre."
Arctic,"Arctic is elegantly shot, crisp and unfussy, and seamless in its near-invisible use of digital effects, creating a persuasive you-are-there feeling that's rare in these days of flashy CG thrills."
Arctic,"Here is a gripping and efficient addition to the rugged survivalist thriller genre, a realm where men are men and howling lamentations at the unforgiving sky is seen as entirely acceptable behaviour."
Arctic,"There are no cut corners, no overly blatant only-in-the-movies gambits. Mikkelsen's stranded pilot has little to rely on beyond his will, so we feel at every step that he could truly be us."
Everybody Knows,"Atmospheric and evocative... It's not the best of Farhadi, but even a lesser Farhadi is better than most films."
Everybody Knows,"The distractingly oft-repeated title seems to herald an unfortunate new approach to imparting information for Farhadi: everybody will know everything, even if it means clumsy exposition, heavy-handed foreshadowing, and redundancy."
Everybody Knows,"While Farhadi is a master of the drama, his gifts are at times an awkward fit for a kidnapping thriller. It is almost as if one bought a ticket for a Liam Neeson movie and wound up instead in a Strindberg play."
Everybody Knows,"While it's not vintage Farhadi, the film has merits, not least the magnificent Bárbara Lennie."
Everybody Knows,A film of heart-wrenching moments that never quite lands a telling emotional blow.
Everybody Knows,"Here we are lost in a deracinated landscape somewhere between Agatha Christie and Aeschylus. The whodunnit tensions are too often vitiated by ""who cares?"""
Everybody Knows,"Farhadi is an excellent screenwriter and an impressive handler of actors, but the film nonetheless adds up to less than the sum of its parts."
Everybody Knows,"The acting's uniformly strong, always at the service of a knotty story."
Everybody Knows,"The film is briskly paced and visually gorgeous, the winegrowing region of Spain providing a colourful backdrop to the drama."
Everybody Knows,"A great finish can save an otherwise ho-hum movie, just as a flat ending can undo an otherwise strong one. ""Everybody Knows"" is an example of the latter. It's disappointing for everybody involved."
Everybody Knows,"There's a lovely sense, throughout the film, of how real life sometimes interrupts things, the way a child's prattling disrupts the pretty wedding ceremony, or how even in the midst of grief breakfast must be made."
Everybody Knows,"Everybody Knows is not Farhadi's best work, but he does deliver an affair to remember."
Everybody Knows,"The people in the movie are keeping secrets from each other, and ""Everybody Knows"" is keeping secrets from us."
Everybody Knows,Farhadi ameliorates the sense of familiarity by bringing in more surprises.
Everybody Knows,"""Everybody Knows"" is a reminder that sometimes we just want to go to movies to watch pretty people screw up their lives."
Everybody Knows,"If this is a ""B"" Asghar Farhadi film, it's still better than the ""A"" efforts of many other filmmakers."
Everybody Knows,It's a look in philosophical harmony with Farhadi's intense but humane gaze. And the actors are superb...
Everybody Knows,"Think of it this way: If this were a book, it would be described as a page-turner."
Everybody Knows,"Is ""Everybody Knows"" as searing and devastating a film as Farhadi's best work? Probably not, but it is surely one of his most relatable."
Everybody Knows,"The movie is not to be skipped. You should sample its mixture of bacchanal and gall, and revel in Farhadi's dependable deftness, as he sketches and frames his collection of characters."
Everybody Knows,The movie's chief delights are the Cruz-Bardem pairing and Farhadi's generosity toward all the characters as he veers from joy to terror.
Everybody Knows,"Farhadi has never been a filmmaker interested in giving his audience easy answers. I admire that. Still, he makes missteps."
Everybody Knows,Few filmmakers have ever been as gifted at affirming the degree to which we are more alike than we may ever have thought possible.
Everybody Knows,"As a piece of storytelling, Everybody Knows covers a vast expanse of human experience, but it doesn't dive very deep."
Everybody Knows,"As ever, Farhadi shines at creating characters whose emotional complexity helps disguise his penchant for arbitrary plot twists."
Everybody Knows,"The emotions in Everybody Knows are palpable, but the storytelling stumbles."
Everybody Knows,"Perhaps not Farhadi's most piercing work but surely a polished, textured, and very engaging effort"
Everybody Knows,The exception is in the performances: The collaboration between Cruz and Bardem is the film's greatest strength.
Everybody Knows,"It's as if The Big Chill's characters were all involved in Taken, with particular sets of skills ranging from condescension to passive aggression."
Everybody Knows,"There are still moments, whole sequences really, that remind us of Farhadi's gift for creating extraordinary tension out of domestic drama."
Everybody Knows,"For any other filmmaker this film would unarguably be a great accomplishment, but for someone of Farhadi's caliber, everybody knows he's capable of much, much more."
Everybody Knows,I was held rapt through its entirety.
Everybody Knows,"As he transfers his talents to a European setting and Spanish-speaking cast, Farhadi loses none of his remarkable ability to observe close relationships collapsing under stress."
Everybody Knows,"Amidst a superb cast, Bardem and Cruz are both strong playing characters who haven't let go of the past -- a familiar affliction in Farhadi's films."
Everybody Knows,Penélope Cruz shines.
Everybody Knows,Absorbing enough but lacking in any real sense of revelation...this undeniably gifted storyteller seems firmly stuck on Cruz control.
Everybody Knows,"Eventually the broader format of the film turns out to be soap opera like, complete with an awkwardly handled big reveal that anyone can see coming."
Everybody Knows,"Still, with its rich story, its weighty themes, and the beautiful acting of its charismatic stars (and real-life spouses), Cruz and Bardem, it's the classiest soap opera around."
Everybody Knows,"The film is too laden with its own riches, a festival jewel that glares instead of gleams."
Everybody Knows,"Instead, we get a film that lurches listlessly here and there, dipping into sub-par Agatha Christie for a chunk, then opting for some hugely overdone Spanish soap opera dynamics..."
Everybody Knows,"With a cast this starry and talented the play of revelation and counter-revelation that is reckoned to be Farhadi's metier could hardly fail to entertain, even if the film rather shuns its environment and landscape in favour of somewhat stagey interiors."
Everybody Knows,Feels meandering and indistinct.
Everybody Knows,"Knowledge is power, but in Everybody Knows, nobody's quite certain about the whole truth."
Everybody Knows,"In its most powerful moments, Everybody Knows is full of acute and often very pessimistic observations about human behaviour."
Everybody Knows,"Too much of Everybody Knows telegraphs a mechanical, deterministic logic that negates the film's more emotionally combustible energy."
Everybody Knows,"The mystery becomes popcorn-chompingly compelling, each new piece of information adding shading and dimension to the true shape of the family. Nobody is above suspicion or below empathy."
Everybody Knows,No director does more with worried adults. And if we must watch adults worry then they may as well be played by Bardem and Cruz.
Everybody Knows,"You go to a Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem film for the chemistry, but this one feels like mathematics."
Everybody Knows,The narrative keeps hobbling from one plot strand to the other without ever really becoming a gripping maelstrom of revelations as things get progressively worse for the characters.
Everybody Knows,"Cruz may have the showier role, but the men - Bardem and Darín both - wind up baring their souls in astonishing ways."
Everybody Knows,"The performances themselves are so intelligent, mature and yet uninhibited. Farhadi's storytelling has overpowering force."
Everybody Knows,"A quietly gripping examination of societal divisions, of class, of secrets that bind us together and pull us apart."
Brian Banks,"This is a perfectly serviceable movie -- it's a drama, it's well-acted, it's well-written. It's working, generally speaking."
Brian Banks,The emancipation Brian Banks depicts becomes narrative chains in its wake.
Brian Banks,"Hodge's resolute performance anchors the film, while the nuanced screenplay from Doug Atchison and lush visual language from cinematographer Ricardo Diaz push it several rungs above prosaic TV-movie-style fare."
Brian Banks,"Brian Banks almost never surprises us. We know where the story is going. (If it didn't go a certain way, there would be no movie.) Still, it's a well-constructed, well-acted, solidly told tale."
Brian Banks,"The true story of a football player falsely accused of sexual assault is lifted by Aldis Hodge in the title role but brought low by a flat, formulaic telling."
Brian Banks,[A] well-intentioned film crippled by its dramatic structure.
Brian Banks,"For ""Brian Banks..."" it to succeed we have to buy Banks as an exceptional individual, able to rise above adversity and doubts by virtue of his determination, belief in self and overall strength of personality, all of which Hodge urgently conveys."
Brian Banks,"Playing Banks over the course of more than a decade, Hodge consistently makes the movie compelling, even when it veers toward a safe, faith-based uplift."
Brian Banks,"""Brian Banks"" isn't a great movie, but it is a worthwhile one."
Brian Banks,"All told, ""Brian Banks"" might be a bit out of step with its moment. Taken on its own, though, it's a solid and satisfying true-life drama."
Brian Banks,"""Brian Banks"" is an OK look at a grave injustice, the kind of film that you can tell while you're watching it ought to be more inspiring, but never quite is."
Brian Banks,"This is a movie that seems utterly convinced that it's saying something profound, but proves difficult to actually parse."
Brian Banks,A Lifetime movie-like drama that falls short of engaging with the many thorny issues it dramatizes.
Brian Banks,"The story pulls you along, traveling a long, winding path from wrongful conviction to exoneration."
Brian Banks,This movie needed a grittier treatment.
Brian Banks,"Not only are the women in the film completely underwritten (with Kennisha's depiction particularly woeful), but Shadyac and Atchison also don't really do any favors for their eponymous hero either."
Brian Banks,[A] painful reminder of how young black people still face overwhelming disadvantages.
Brian Banks,"The real Brian Banks, the subject of this movie, lived through an ordeal that was tragic, inspiring and often profound. However, something is lost in this one-dimensional retelling of his life experiences."
Brian Banks,"""Brian Banks"" may be a football player's underdog story, but this is no conventional sports movie."
Brian Banks,"Hodge's performance is what keeps the film on track. He is powerful in scenes of anger, but he may be even better in purely silent moments where his unspoken reactions are eloquent."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"It's an independent film with a difference, but not as emotionally engaging as you'd really like it to be."
The Last Black Man in San F…,Fails and Talbot's writing follows no script doctor's convention. The direction reveals no obvious influences.
The Last Black Man in San F…,It's less of a rallying cry against gentrification than a rumination on the kind of pained acceptance those who suffer its effects must face.
The Last Black Man in San F…,It's beautifully filmed and perfectly played. The final shot is as epic as it is heartbreaking.
The Last Black Man in San F…,The men behind The Last Black Man in San Francisco aren't trying to be cool or sleek. That's the last thing on their minds and probably explains why they do such a fine job of standing out from the crowd.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"While Talbot and Fails avoid turning their homespun homesick story into an unwieldy and self-important metaphor for Black American Experience in total, creeping bloat makes itself felt elsewhere."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The whole film lifts and sighs as a lament for vanished birthrights, while coaxing these characters to cherish what they have."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"This interplay between an almost documentary authenticity and obviously sculpted political allegorical, then between fiction and reality, imbue the film with an odd intensity."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The Last Black Man in San Francisco has a bad case of whimsicality. There is no cure for this except sour lemons, which Joe Talbot's film invites critics to throw."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Half mood-piece, half character study, The Last Black Man In San Francisco is a deeply moving lament on the effect of gentrification on the people on the Bay Area's margins."
The Last Black Man in San F…,The Last Black Man In San Francisco is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best films you'll see in 2019.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"This is an extremely gentle movie... There's poetry in this movie, but what this is telling us is a brutal story."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Joe Talbot's lovely, quasi-Dickensian film boasts no absolute truths, instead leaning into its ambiguity, humanity and a quizzical moodiness."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The Last Black Man in San Francisco is a poetic and picturesque ode to the title city, to friendship and to the universal urge to find a place to call home."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Even though Talbot opts for a quasi-humorous approach to the subject matter, the comedic edge can't hide an underlying sadness about what this all means."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"There is something irrepressibly original and exciting in the collaboration that results between Talbot, Fails and co-writer Rob Richert - a cinematic vision that feels as fresh as it does necessary."

The Last Black Man in San F…,"The acting by the two principals is impeccable, their portrait of male friendship is deeply felt."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"It sometimes feels as if Talbot is overplaying his hand-his use of slow-motion, for instance, feels needlessly arty-but one can't deny the seriousness of his concerns or his emotional investment in the material."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"This is a gorgeously shot film, alternating between images of San Francisco at its most beautiful and promising, and visuals of the lost and the homeless and the forgotten, who might as well be invisible to the techies..."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The film creates a poetic, dreamlike mood that almost floats over the story, an astonishingly assured debut that trusts the story and trusts the audience."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"In many ways it's a parable: clear yet opaque, simple yet weighty."
The Last Black Man in San F…,The Last Black Man in San Francisco offers the perspective of residents who are embedded in the here and now rather than those who have only recently arrived looking for something better.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Even when Talbot and Fails risk unraveling the film's most cherished verities, they do so with the mesmerizing grace of a skateboard gliding down Lombard Street."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The way Talbot blends haunting imagery with a mournful score (by Emile Mosseri) is dreamlike, recalling the work of ""Moonlight"" director Barry Jenkins."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"With only a handful of lines, each of these actors carries in them the history that Talbot's film tries, but fails, to conjure."
The Last Black Man in San F…,The Last Black Man in San Francisco is beautiful.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"""Last Black Man"" is two hours of a feeling, one that it can't sustain through beauty alone... Still, ""Last Black Man"" pulses with undeniable energy and the promise of other, even better films to come."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The film's greatest virtue lies in how it portrays the city it's rhapsodizing about, and that's what Talbot's promising, large-canvas photography is best suited for."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The film captures the experience of displacement, of travelling among spheres in which you have increasingly little say or stake and trying to blend in."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The Last Black Man in San Francisco is an exquisite dirge for the loss of a city, of home, of community. But most of all, it mourns the loss of possibility, and for some that load is just too heavy to bear."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Jimmie's story is a slow ballad, a tragic ode, a dirty limerick, a wistful lament and a heartbreaking elegy. It's a tribute to the notion of home that we all carry."
The Last Black Man in San F…,The Last Black Man is a sequence of undeniably lovely grace notes that don't always cohere. Yet the movie is held together by the progress of Jimmie's conflict with himself...
The Last Black Man in San F…,The Last Black Man in San Francisco glides from moment to meaningful moment with cumulative power and singular grace.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"It would be correct to call The Last Black Man a story about gentrification, but that word hardly captures the movie's mystery and its heartbeat."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"[It] is pensive and poetic, verging almost on magical realism. It's a beautiful film, sometime almost too much so."
The Last Black Man in San F…,The Last Black Man in San Francisco is heartbreaking and elegiac in all the best ways.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The Last Black Man plays like a poetic portrait, part tender ode and part cartography of lived experience, bringing a nuanced and hard-earned perspective to the screen."
The Last Black Man in San F…,This magnificent debut often feels like something utterly new.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"""The Last Black Man"" is a strikingly immersive movie, a slow burn filled with subtleties and nuance, with its message nestled in the details as much as the greater story."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"simultaneously announces itself as an expressive portrait of a city, an endearing ode to male comradery, a leisurely paced hangout flick, an absurdist comedy, and a melancholic reflection on gentrification and urban black experience."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Fails has handed over to Talbot the intricate and fragile treasures of a lifetime, and Talbot has melted them down and reshaped them into something smooth, shiny, and hollow."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Multi-cultural neighborhoods enrich cities in ways that are often not appreciated or valued until they're gone. That's a timely, urgent and important missive that this film conveys, imperfectly."
The Last Black Man in San F…,This is bound to go down as one of the all-time-great San Francisco films.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Shot in a woozy, unreal, and dryly comedic style that splits the difference between Spike Jonze and Spike Lee, The Last Black Man in San Francisco slows the world down just enough for you to feel it changing."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Talbot is a striking filmmaker, giving his film both a lived-in authenticity - the location work is evocative, and he's filled the screen with oddball locals - and a fairy-tale hermeticism."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Talbot, Fails and their collaborators have given the programmers, and us, an undeniable gem. It plays like a gauntlet that's been thrown down. But it feels like a gift."
The Last Black Man in San F…,A shot of a lonely man rowing through choppy waters under the Golden Gate Bridge sends things into the realm of purest urban poetry.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"The Last Black Man in San Francisco is an ambitious, jubilant work that portrays the brutal community disintegration caused by gentrification."
The Last Black Man in San F…,The Last Black Man in San Francisco remains consistently gorgeous and unpredictable.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Still, The Last Black Man in San Francisco is worth seeing and provides thought-provoking and impactful performances audiences won't soon forget."
The Last Black Man in San F…,The originality and scope of Talbot's vision feels exciting.
The Last Black Man in San F…,"[A] story that doesn't announce its themes but instead transforms lived-in ideas about friendship, loneliness, artmaking, gentrification and the many faces of black masculinity."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"[G]orgeously shot, keenly felt, and utterly original in both style and execution."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"[T]he movie has an offbeat, meandering rhythm and a marvelous sense of possibility."
The Last Black Man in San F…,"There's reality and heart stirring underneath the artifice, I just wish more of it had been allowed to shine through."
The Last Black Man in San F…,A highly original and impressive feature debut.
The Last Black Man in San F…,A gorgeous and touchingly idealistic movie...
The Last Black Man in San F…,"Fragility remains taboo for men particularly around other men, but Talbot's movie warns about the destructive consequences of labels that restrict people from being fully themselves."
Tolkien,Tolkien is innocuous but uninspiring.
Tolkien,Fans of Tolkien's writing probably won't discover anything new about the man from this film and the attempts to turn the Somme battlefield into a sort of fiery Middle Earth look painfully contrived. This is a minor biography of a major writer.
Tolkien,"The film looks great, a polished period piece, but the pedigree is ragged... The result is polite, plodding and unconvincing, like most movies about famous writers."
Tolkien,"""Tolkien"" doesn't seem all that interested in providing any kind of entertainment."
Tolkien,"Tolkien is on a journey, and while the film may deprive us of an arrival, it does give us a rather exhilarating travel itinerary."
Tolkien,Tolkien may have been the most important modern fantasy author but the movie bearing his name won't stand the test of time.
Tolkien,"If you're going to tell the story of one of the most imaginative writing minds of the 20th century, why not infuse it with more ... imagination?"
Tolkien,Why do people keep making films about writers?
Tolkien,"For a film that seems to aspire to greatness, ""Tolkien"" is done in by its lack of vision. That was one quality which Tolkien himself was never accused of lacking."
Tolkien,"Director Dome Karukoski treats Tolkien and his story with reverence, and Hoult plays him with handsome rigidity. But neither the story nor portrayal ever come to life."
Tolkien,Tolkien casts a delicate spell: it's not difficult to imagine some viewers proving utterly impervious to its peculiar magic. But some others will be enchanted and even transported by its charms.
Tolkien,"Tolkien approaches its subject with maybe a little bit too much reverence, but shows an interest in the development of Tolkien's ideas, his passion for philology (not the most cinematic of subjects), his love of myths and legends."
Tolkien,What's left is a kaleidoscope of well-staged episodes - Tolkien on the field of battle surrounded by a circle of dead bodies is harrowing - that often seem more like prettified postcards from midcentury Britain than real-life being lived by real people.
Tolkien,As welcome as second breakfast.
Tolkien,Hoult and Collins made the Ronald/Edith relationship vital and romantic.
Tolkien,"If only the film could live in these relationships a bit more and see something inspiring in them instead of constantly searching these moments for something, anything that inspired Middle Earth."
Tolkien,"It's perhaps understandable that the Tolkien estate isn't interested in being associated with this biopic - and not just because it simplifies and fudges, as biopics do."
Tolkien,Tolkien is to filmmaking what spoon-feeding is to infants.
Tolkien,"Maybe Tolkien had a fascinating life story full of anecdotes that inspired his future work, but it isn't told here."
Tolkien,The result doesn't rise above the insight of a Wikipedia page.
Tolkien,"The performances are wonderful, especially Hoult and Collins, who exude a charming chemistry."
Tolkien,"""Tolkien"" has plenty to recommend it, beginning with a more than credible performance from Nicholas Hoult in the title role."
Tolkien,[The movie] teems with many on-the-nose moments. And it does so while hewing so strongly to the Distinguished British Biopic ethos... that it teeters on the edge of genuine obnoxiousness.
Tolkien,"Origin tales usually give us the backstories of beloved characters. ""Tolkien,"" by contrast, dramatizes the events that created a creator."
Tolkien,"With a faint plop, ""Tolkien"" lands in the marshy middle ground of disappointment."
Tolkien,"Stately, handsome and ferociously romantic, the new biopic of British high-fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien won't be everyone's cup of tea, though there is some excellent tea drinking to be had."
Tolkien,"When people getting hot for ancient languages is the exciting part of your movie, you've got a problem."
Tolkien,"The character development successfully makes people root for Tolkien and his friends. Director Dome Karukoski guides the actors well with a perfectly British script containing dry, witty humor."
Tolkien,"At its best, Tolkien creates, within the audience, a sympathetic understanding of the forces that gave rise to Tolkien's works."
Tolkien,"Karukoski never really succeeds in depicting the student, and later soldier, Tolkien as all that unusual."
Tolkien,"""Tolkien"" is anodyne enough that no one should be terribly upset by it, let alone deeply moved in any other way."
Tolkien,There are times when the Tolkien the character seems more interested in his past than Tolkien the movie does.
Tolkien,"But that imagination is what is most conspicuously lacking in ""Tolkien,"" which too often falls back into a pose of intellectual and aesthetic timidity."
Tolkien,It uses its imagination to build a thoughtful and charming portrait.
Tolkien,For the most part this is stolid film-making that lacks the imagination and creativity of its subject.
Tolkien,"Handsomely made in the customarily fastidious style of most period biographical dramas, Tolkien is strongly served by Hoult..."
Tolkien,"The film - stately, well-acted, and ultimately insubstantial - dilutes its considerable charms with hoary literary biopic conventions, and then risks strangling them entirely with its reductively literal takes on the vagaries of artistic inspiration."
Tolkien,"Hoult brings a quiet, romantic intensity to the young Tolkien, Lily Collins does a lot with a little as his first love Edith, and the Hobbit horde will gobble up all of the easter-egg references peppered throughout the movie."
Tolkien,"Throws into sharp relief the hitherto unexplored tragedy of the artist's life. Imagine it: you're one of the great artists of the 20th century, and yet your own story is embarrassingly contrived."
Tolkien,"The film preaches of the love of creative freedom, yet finds no original form of expression of its own."
Tolkien,"An essential problem with Tolkien is its tone: you could call it solemn, reverential or even hagiographic, but essentially it topples a script which doesn't bear up to all the worthiness."
Tolkien,"In the end, the tragedy of the film is that it's not a great First World War movie. It's not a good film about public schoolboys. And it's certainly not an effective literary biopic."
Tolkien,The film develops into a period version of a rites of passage story about youngsters on the verge of adulthood - a sort of Edwardian American Graffiti.
Tolkien,Tolkien is a biopic covering the early life of J.R.R. Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult) and it is not especially memorable. I'm even forgetting it as I'm trying to remember it.
Tolkien,Its earnestness and idealism are refreshing.
Tolkien,"Tolkien the film does not memorialise or re-contextualise Tolkien the man in any remotely interesting sense: instead, it just meekly prods him through the Theory of Everything-iser and hopes for the best."
Tolkien,"Director Dome Karukoski wisely understates the line from... carnage to orc-filled battlefields, even if the fine actor Craig Roberts is cast as a working class proto-Bilbo guiding Tolkien through the trenches."
Tolkien,"Karukoski's entertaining film boasts flair and narrative ambition, but ultimately fails to completely break free of its traditional biopic frame."
Tolkien,"Tolkien follows the well-worn path of the literary biopic, steadfast in its refusal to even consider the separation of art from artist."
Tolkien,"Director Dome Karukoski peppers the film with cutaways to imaginary CGI battles and mythological beasties, but none is a fraction as thrilling as the opening moments of Peter Jackson's 'The Fellowship of the Ring'."
The Sun is Also a Star,"The pacing can be quick, but overall this film will warm the heart of any hopeless romantic."
The Sun is Also a Star,"Yes, it's both too bad and too good to be true, but there could be no better time for such fantasies."
The Sun is Also a Star,"For tween and teen fans of the book and love stories in general, the Nicola Yoon adaptation The Sun is Also a Star will provide a romantic, if sometimes meandering, viewing experience."
The Sun is Also a Star,The Sun is Also a Star might be the most infuriating film I've seen in 2019.
The Sun is Also a Star,"For all of its well-meaning examinations of race, The Sun Is Also a Star rests upon troubling casting...In many regards, The Sun Is Also a Star fights itself."
The Sun is Also a Star,"I believed in Natasha and Daniel; I believed in the implausibility of their day. And I believed in the movie's mission, however overpronounced."
The Sun is Also a Star,"Shahidi and Melton are charming and utterly watchable together. They're both absurdly attractive and skilled actors, but whatever magic exists between them is limited by Tracy Oliver's script."
The Sun is Also a Star,"The sun, the moon, the stars and all sorts of cosmic gobbledygook are thrown into ""The Sun is Also a Star,"" a love story that shows how difficult it is to manufacture fate on screen."
The Sun is Also a Star,"Although devoid of sophistication and overly dependent on contrivance, the frothy, fizzy giddiness of the love story may win over viewers who are predisposed to enjoy this sort of entertainment."
The Sun is Also a Star,"While time is likely on the side of its leads, their chemistry only goes so far in what feels, finally, like a half-baked movie."
The Sun is Also a Star,"The Sun Is Also A Star fell far short of my expectations, offering a romance that never manages to shine."
The Sun is Also a Star,It's a tightly wrapped microcosm of many of the conversations driving our political zeitgeist.
The Sun is Also a Star,"Once again, with the odds stacked against them, two extremely attractive people have fallen in love."
The Sun is Also a Star,"We are told again and again that both protagonists have urgent, life-shaping matters to attend to, but-as portrayed on screen-the stakes couldn't feel less consequential. Nor could the circumstances that keep throwing them together feel more contrived."
The Sun is Also a Star,"Oliver and director Ry Russo-Young (Before I Fall)... don't go far enough to mask the skimpiness of the story, which has been whittled down to Natasha and Daniel almost exclusively."
The Sun is Also a Star,Forget physics. These teens need to work on their chemistry.
The Sun is Also a Star,"The leads are so lovely and the city is so shimmery that it's hard not to get caught up in its spell-for a while, at least, until its corny coda."
The Sun is Also a Star,"Under the perfectly paced direction of Ry Russo-Young, Shahidi and Melton develop an easy chemistry on the way toward a satisfying denouement that's neither tear-jerking tragedy nor fairy-tale wish fulfillment."
The Sun is Also a Star,"It's all quite wistfully romantic, and mostly winningly so, despite the sometimes wise-way-beyond-their-years dialogue and not always plausible plot."
The Sun is Also a Star,"When you're looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesn't seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse."
The Sun is Also a Star,"""Sun"" unapologetically embraces deep-dish romantic fantasy and unashamedly exults in the most shameless coincidences imaginable. If that sounds noticeably lacking in irony, sarcasm and snark, it's just going to have to be that way."
The Sun is Also a Star,"The slacker enchantment of Richard Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy transplants just fine to Generation Z's Manhattan, with its selfies and laser-lit noraebang parlors."
The Sun is Also a Star,"They are so appealing - I mean, his last name is Bae, and she never makes a joke about it - that you will totally believe that he is a budding poet and that her thing is astronomy."
The Sun is Also a Star,A dull-witted romance that isn't helped by its semi-topical premise.
The Sun is Also a Star,"While ""The Sun Is Also a Star"" stands out in its YA genre, it certainly doesn't transcend it."
The Sun is Also a Star,The sparks are few in this labored romance.
The Sun is Also a Star,"Every demographic deserves their own ridiculous, wish-fulfilling romance; Sun just trades in too much silliness to ever really shine."
The Sun is Also a Star,"[Y]ou don't have to be a lovesick adolescent to fall, just a little, for its goofy energy."
The Sun is Also a Star,"Although the big-screen adaptation of Nicola Yoon's best-selling young adult novel finds welcome specificity in its world and character building, it never rises above the most generic of platitudes in its central teen love story."
The Sun is Also a Star,"Even by generic standards, The Sun Is Also a Star is simply misbegotten."
The Sun is Also a Star,The Sun is Also a Story is a compassionate and old-fashioned romance with a progressive story relevant to today.
The Sun is Also a Star,"There's enough of a tenderhearted first-romance fantasy to like, but not to fully love."
The Sun is Also a Star,"We spend nearly two hours with The Sun is Also a Star, but the film never makes us fall in love with it, despite its best efforts."
The Sun is Also a Star,"Melton and Shahidi make a graceful transition from television to the big screen, with charisma and chemistry to spare."
The Goldfinch,A flat and lumbering albeit beautifully filmed drama that bores more than it entertains.
The Goldfinch,"It's all poeticism without a sense of humanity, since the characters themselves aren't written as people, but as broad statements."
The Goldfinch,"Whether or not you've read the book, the film of The Goldfinch is definitely worth a look; it's no masterpiece but it's a whole heap better than many of the studio-made American films released so far this year."
The Goldfinch,"I sat there, watching and thinking, ""there are so many good things in this, yet none of them are touching me in the slightest."" I was bored, and that's almost the most damning thing. Considerably less than the sum of its parts."
The Goldfinch,A beautifully shot mess.
The Goldfinch,"There is no sense of pace or mystery, but rather an evident need to get through Tartt's dense plotting in the two-and-a-half-hour run time."
The Goldfinch,"The Goldfinch is dull, shapeless and unconvincing."
The Goldfinch,A cool sterility lingers beneath every cue meant to tug at our insides.
The Goldfinch,"In abandoning the strict linearity of Tartt's story, the film may replicate Theo's stream of consciousness, but it's at the cost of narrative rhythm and Stevensonian electricity."
The Goldfinch,"It is, indeed, beautiful to look at, but it's not layered or textured or meaningful and it plays like a tiresome, empty blockbuster that goes on and on and on."
The Goldfinch,"Ah, poor wussums. The Goldfinch is the kind of movie that you want to pick up and cuddle, and stroke its befuddled head, and say: ""There, there, it's all right, you did your best."
The Goldfinch,"Tartt's book has been put through a grater, then reassembled into a wet prestige patty of a picture, all dainty set dressing and limp psychology."
The Goldfinch,Maybe it would have worked better as an eight-part TV drama.
The Goldfinch,"Everything, I'm sure, stands for something; except the audience, which wilts horizontally in its seats. I'll have to read the novel."
The Goldfinch,"The Goldfinch is an unmistakable fiasco, pretentious and incoherent even on its own terms."
The Goldfinch,"Frankly, you might have more fun watching a pigeon for 149 minutes."
The Goldfinch,"The Goldfinch isn't a filmmaking travesty, but it is a mess, a movie trying so hard to be prestigious that it fails to be anything at all."
The Goldfinch,"An enthralling story on the page, this adaptation fails to capture what good adaptations can: the heart and spirit of a story told in another medium."
The Goldfinch,"Veteran actor Jeffrey Wright gives the only spot-on performance, but even he can't save a silly storyline from itself."
The Goldfinch,Simultaneously overlong and yet not enough.
The Goldfinch,"Despite flaws, the movie intelligently captures the novel's intertwining themes..."
The Goldfinch,This sprawling yet rushed adaptation of Donna Tartt's novel is textureless and flavorless.
The Goldfinch,The film suffers from both an excessive faithfulness to its source and a general failure to translate that material into anything close to a gripping onscreen narrative.
The Goldfinch,"In a film all about ""life, eh,"" there isn't a whole lot in it."
The Goldfinch,"It's an object lesson in what not to do in an adaptation, yet it's occasionally effective enough that you can see a much more successful movie buried within it."
The Goldfinch,"The film grows more florid and dramatic as it unfolds, and more disjointed; even with reliable actors like Elgort, Wright, Nicole Kidman, Sarah Paulson, and Luke Wilson on hand, the storytelling feels clunky in a way Brooklyn never did."
The Goldfinch,"I don't know why critics in Toronto attacked this film the way they did. It's not perfect, to be sure, but it's not a bad movie by any means."
The Goldfinch,"The movie represents a transparent bid to bring the book's prestige to the screen, but it's another case of literary underpinnings being lost in translation."
The Goldfinch,"There are ideas at work here, about providence and salvation (or at least their secular counterparts), about civilization and the worthwhile work of preserving it, and about defining moments and our response to them. But there isn't much of a movie."
The Goldfinch,"""The Goldfinch"" is stoic and sad, occasionally brilliant and more often confusing."
The Goldfinch,"""Unfortunately, in ""The Goldfinch"", a barrelful of cinematic filigree adorns an empty antique memory box."""
The Goldfinch,"For a work inspired by a classic painting, this dense mishmash of genres and styles is as lifeless as a photocopy."
The Goldfinch,A little bit of faith is all you need to see it through.
The Goldfinch,"It is a mess, and not in an interesting way."
The Goldfinch,"It's supposed to be a picaresque adventure... Instead, it feels like a movie where way too many things happen, and we don't know anything about the people who make them happen."
The Goldfinch,"A slew of solid work that never comes together. Poor pacing, jarring transitions and a third act that feels like a completely different film."
The Goldfinch,"While the story's symbolism about surviving disaster and loss may be better suited to a novel than to a film, in the end the movie, like the painting for which it's named, has the talismanic power."
The Goldfinch,It's possible I liked the motion picture as much as I did thanks to my affinity for Tartt's novel.
The Goldfinch,Mr. Straughan [the screenwriter] remains faithful to the book when he should be committing adultery. Chunks of original dialogue land like bricks.
The Goldfinch,"To the list of great books mangled by Hollywood, add The Goldfinch. This cinematic assault on Donna Tartt's Pulitzer prize winner misuses gifted actors (Kidman, Elgort, Paulson) to reduce the book to truncated rubble and create a botch job for the ages."
The Goldfinch,"Luke Wilson and Sarah Paulson are wonderful actors, but they are stuck playing broad caricatures more suited to a particularly crass old episode of Two and a Half Men than a film with such lofty ambitions."
The Goldfinch,Chaos reigns.
The Goldfinch,"It's handsomely mounted, respectful to a fault, well-acted-and totally bloodless."
The Goldfinch,"In the end, if someone doesn't have the time to absorb Tartt's book, they'd be better serviced reading a Wikipedia synopsis than seeing this film."
The Goldfinch,The adaptation is way too reverent.
The Goldfinch,"In simultaneously successfully shoving in every little thing and thus ruining the book, director John Crowley and writer Peter Straughan have killed two birds with one stone."
The Goldfinch,"Though often entrancing, the movie isn't saying quite as much as it thinks it is."
The Goldfinch,"Although Peter Straughan's stripped-down regurgitation of the story is faithful to Tartt's narrative in the broadest sense of the word, it lacks elegance and depth."
The Goldfinch,"Simpering and dull, devoid of tension, an overwrought and uninvolving film that is both a personal drama and a crime mystery, but also neither of those things, and nearly, nothing at all."
The Goldfinch,"""The Goldfinch,"" John Crowley's film adaptation of Tartt's novel, lands unsatisfyingly in the middle."
The Goldfinch,"It's terrible when a beloved novel arrives onscreen with a self-important thud, and that's putting it diplomatically in the case of The Goldfinch."
The Goldfinch,It looks and sounds like a movie without quite being one.
The Goldfinch,A movie as inert as the famous oil painting it is titled for.
The Goldfinch,"[Donna] Tartt's novel comes in at such great length because it's trying, for better or worse, to emulate that artistic technique. And in sticking so closely to the plot of the novel, The Goldfinch loses the story, and the soul, of its source."
The Goldfinch,"Ultimately, ""The Goldfinch"" feels like a series of often-elegant moments, in service to a story that never quite comes into focus."
The Goldfinch,"Watching ""The Goldfinch"" is like reading a novel where someone ripped out every third page from front to back."
The Goldfinch,"Overstuffed, overlong and utterly uninvolving, this is a movie that feels as morbidly trapped as the poor little bird of its title."
The Goldfinch,Enough of the individual moments pulled from the rag-and-bone shop of Donna Tartt's sprawling mystery narrative make an emotional impact that the story's structural issues fail to register as much at first.
The Goldfinch,A beautiful but shockingly hollow experience.
The Goldfinch,The Goldfinch should have never flown away from its literary perch.
The Goldfinch,"While John Crowley's film is faithful to its source, Tartt's story is not terribly cinematic, and the end result, while fitfully entertaining, isn't likely to satisfy anyone on its own merits."
The Goldfinch,"Somehow, The Goldfinch feels like more than the sum of its disparate parts; a painting in the wrong frame, maybe, but one whose imperfect beauty still draws you in."
The Goldfinch,"John Crowley's adaptation of Donna Tartt's novel is beautifully photographed and eloquently told, but too emotionally muted for its own good."
The Goldfinch,The story The Goldfinch tells feels utterly absurd.
The Goldfinch,"Ansel Elgort's performance is a flat, dull nothing."
The Goldfinch,Cinematic taxidermy.
The Goldfinch,"The Goldfinch is better than I expected it would be. And yet in clearing that bar, it bares open all the possibility that it could have been even more."
The Goldfinch,"""The Goldfinch"" tries hard to be a masterwork like the painting that shares its title but ends up feeling more like a forgery."
The Goldfinch,"It's neither a rousing success nor an embarrassing failure, falling somewhere in between, closer to admirable attempt."
The Goldfinch,"Unlike the tiny painting that gave the book its name, the film deserves a more expansive canvas."
The Goldfinch,"Yet a morose and downbeat movie, too lost in the maze of its designer seriousness, is what ""The Goldfinch"" finally is."
The Mustang,Superb acting and tight directing elevate this film about an inmate training a wild mustang.
The Mustang,[Their] connection is so wondrous and quietly powerful... This is lovely.
The Mustang,"Terse and elegiac at best, The Mustang is a dude Western from the Horse Whisperer school."
The Mustang,"As Schoenaerts demonstrated with his pin-eyed rage in Bullhead, he's a physically gifted actor who can convey as much with stillness and silence as he can with pages full of dialogue."
The Mustang,"Animals have been coaxing the soft side out of tough guys since Clint Eastwood co-starred with an orangutan, yet there's still something poignant about this meathead engaging with a warmer world."
The Mustang,"While more modest in scale, this might be the most humane addition to the genre since The Shawshank Redemption."
The Mustang,Despite the fact that the central metaphor is fairly straightforward... I actually thought that the movie told its story very movingly.
The Mustang,Manages to be inspirational without going Disney.
The Mustang,"The Mustang could have held more surprises, but as a landscape study - ""Prison, with horses"" - it's ruggedly stunning."
The Mustang,The film excels when it considers ideas of forgiveness and resentment - in the grey areas between those dualities is where The Mustang finds the most human of truths.
The Mustang,"There's a Disney movie in here somewhere, but Clermont-Tonnerre has no interest in it. She's too busy steering her own course, and it works."
The Mustang,Actress turned first-time director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre has a real eye for lyrical images and a gift for casting actors of exceptional skill.
The Mustang,It's worth seeking out... as both a portrait of a prison program few are aware of and a powerful character study.
The Mustang,"It is handsomely shot, affectingly acted, and narratively predictable."
The Mustang,A stringent tale of a struggle for redemption.
The Mustang,Schoenaerts's passion and the horse's grace make their dance-of-life-or-death indelible.
The Mustang,"Like Roman, though, all I longed for were further glimpses of the life outside, where man and beast roam free, oblivious to any narrative demands."
The Mustang,"This film was developed at Robert Redford's Sundance Institute lab for emerging talent; he certainly found one in French actress Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre, here making an impressive feature directorial debut."
The Mustang,"The Mustang, Clermont-Tonnerre's impressive debut feature, is a slow-burning, tightly coiled character study of felony offender Roman Coleman (Bullhead's Schoenaerts)."
The Mustang,"That sophistication in filmmaking and storytelling wins out in the end. The answers don't come easy, and when they do they're more than a little heartbreaking. ""The Mustang"" is all the better for it."
The Mustang,"Within no more than a minute of screen time, we know that director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre has authority and vision, and that we are watching a good movie."
The Mustang,"It's Schoenaerts, one of this generation's finest actors, who makes ""The Mustang"" a moving look at human potential for redemption and rehabilitation."
The Mustang,"A testament to the worthy stories yet to be told about the healing, unbreakable bonds between tormented people and the misunderstood animals that come to their rescue."
The Mustang,"I've been lucky enough to see equine therapy up close, and The Mustang brought the sensation back of having to slow down and breathe with a horse and in the process leave yourself behind."
The Mustang,Her film is about a relationship forged in a give-and-take that treats beast and human as emotional equals.
The Mustang,You can't help but be swept up by the sincerity here -- that and the sight of a hard man softening to a sympathetic nuzzle.
The Mustang,"Filmmaker Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre's story of a troubled convict (an incendiary, indelible Matthias Schoenaerts) bonding with a wild mustang is a striking debut. Each time you think you have this movie pegged, it'll knock you for a loop."
The Mustang,"The director has a good eye for semidocumentary detail, and the performances... all have the sharp tang of authenticity."
The Mustang,The Mustangtells its richly textured story in just 96 minutes. No more is required; it is one of the most satisfying movies I've seen this year.
The Mustang,"This debut feature by Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre opens strong, grows even stronger and, avoiding almost every trap, fulfills its abundant promise."
The Mustang,"Stories of people who are redeemed by animals are a dime a dozen, and that's fine by me: Give me dozens! Even so, The Mustang, Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre's debut feature, is one of the better ones."
The Mustang,"It shouldn't work - none of it - not the metaphor, not the wild horse, not what it all means for the wild man at the center. It does."
The Mustang,"Even with its unusually restrained running time, ""The Mustang"" is a powerful and emotional journey framed by gorgeous sun-soaked shots of the stark Nevada landscape."
The Mustang,"It's all well-trod territory. And yet-and here's another cliché-The Mustang breathes new life into most of those conventions, thanks in no small part to Schoenaerts and his remarkable work."
The Mustang,"Whatever language he works in, Schoenaerts is a singular talent who can convincingly convey danger and menace as naturally as he breathes."
The Mustang,"Single-minded and direct in its execution, the film is a hard look at the extremes of masculine guilt and healing."
The Mustang,"Mustang's tone can come off as too hard-baked, a minor-key study in tortured masculinity; but the cracks that it shows are worth waiting for."
The Mustang,"Between De Clermont-Tonnerre's deft touch and the unforgettable lead performance from Schoenaerts, 'The Mustang' delivers one narrative surprise after the next, not with dramatic twists and turns, but with simple human growth and understanding."
The Mustang,"""The Mustang"" has an arc you can trace, but you will not, I promise you, predict the final shot, and it's a beauty - a tearjerker as delicate as they come."
The Mustang,"De Clermont-Tonnerre shows admirable restraint, knowing that, in her carefully constructed frames, it can be enough just to get Roman's newly compassionate eyes into a close-up with the expressionless eye of a horse."
The Mustang,"It builds instead of races, knowing that it's the accumulation of minor character beats in a film like this one that really matter."
The Mustang,Matthias Schoenaerts and a wild stallion try to tame each other in this stirring and poetic prison drama about a man and his horse.
Gloria Bell,"[Julianne Moore] is always terrific, but she gives an especially terrific, well-rounded performance here. It's nuanced, vulnerable, strong, funny, emotionally rich and textured."
Gloria Bell,"A well-observed, good character study, although something that you may have seen before."
Gloria Bell,Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting - both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove - but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore.
Gloria Bell,The result isn't better than the 2013 original but it's just as good.
Gloria Bell,"Moore's subtle, empathetic work elevates what could be dismissed as a small-scale, even banal story."
Gloria Bell,"Whether she's dealing with conflicts at work, doing laugh therapy sessions, or smoking weed on the floor of her apartment while the Californian sunlight slants through the window, this is a Bell that chimes."
Gloria Bell,Moore appears in almost every scene of the film and in her performance Gloria's resilience shines.
Gloria Bell,"There are low moments, flat moments and unconvincing moments - but Gloria deserves to be protected at all costs."
Gloria Bell,"The thumping heart of all of it is Moore, whose magnetically watchable, fully inhabited, offhandedly sexy performance makes Gloria Bell's reflective longueurs shimmer..."
Gloria Bell,"Despite failing to replicate the authenticity of the original, Gloria Bell offers just the right amount of angst and drama to be able to stand on its own feet."
Gloria Bell,"Lelio structures his film not as a shopping list of plot points, but vignettes and snapshots of the multitudes that Gloria contains..."
Gloria Bell,"There is a terrific performance here from Moore, and an equally good one from Turturro, who may be entering into his own golden years of bittersweet character work."
Gloria Bell,"Stunningly acted and sensitively detailed, it's a modest story of a normal, middle-aged life told with compelling honesty."
Gloria Bell,"Gloria Bell is as complex and understated as its lead character, brought to life by Moore with a lived-in quality, and with texture."
Gloria Bell,It's a story that proves to be well worth the translation.
Gloria Bell,Gloria Bell is a spellbinding treasure.
Gloria Bell,"Gloria Bell smashes the Bechdel test, and that's mostly because filmmaker Sebastián Lelio just lets these scenes of everyday life unfold, and lets Julianne Moore react in them -- masterfully so."
Gloria Bell,"Moore digs in and finds the intricacies in her character. She's not showy, but she turns in an honest, understated performance that all comes together in a joyous, melancholy, liberating dance set to Laura Branigan's ""Gloria."""
Gloria Bell,"There is a kind of daring in the film's very modesty, in Lelio's decision to forego the thrills of melodrama and the lure of glamour to follow an unexceptional woman through the peaks and valleys of her days."
Gloria Bell,"You can see the work, how much effort goes into trying - and, in Gloria Bell's ultimately optimistic framing, that the work is still worth it."
Gloria Bell,The woman getting her groove on on the screen in front of me might as well have been a complete stranger.
Gloria Bell,"You can see Gloria's bad decisions coming from across the street, but it doesn't matter: The pleasure of ""Gloria Bell,"" whether or not you've seen ""Gloria,"" is watching Moore wrap herself in the role like a soft shawl."
Gloria Bell,"""When the world blows up, I hope to go down dancing,"" Bell tells her friends at one point. And mark her words, even when it all falls apart, dance she does."
Gloria Bell,"A movie that says the stories of average women deserve to be told, as do the stories of people who grapple with big challenges but still face each day with hope and wonder."
Gloria Bell,"Because of Moore's open-hearted, captivating portrayal of the title character, repetition won't be a drawback for those who've seen Gloria. She makes the role her own with brio and woman-power strength."
Gloria Bell,"I often wish Lelio's movies were a little longer, messier and a little less tidy, and that's true of ""Gloria Bell,"" too. But what's there is shrewd, engaging and a sturdy actors' showcase."
Gloria Bell,"""Gloria Bell"" wavers between realistic drama and tender comedy, which makes for an uneven but never uninteresting mix."
Gloria Bell,"Not much happens in ""Gloria Bell"" other than someone staking her claim to joy. It's a quiet little movie that speaks the truth like a clarion call."
Gloria Bell,"This is a quiet film, moving at its own pace, reflecting life with such realism it's as if we're invisible guests in Gloria Bell's life."
Gloria Bell,"In a world where film arguably celebrates youth more often than middle-aged people in Hollywood, it's refreshing to see the opposite artfully done with one step on the dance floor at a time."
Gloria Bell,"We're all so angry about ""the other""-whomever that ""other"" might be-that it has come to stand in the way of understanding ourselves. Gloria Bell helps bring us back to that self, whoever he, she or they might be."
Gloria Bell,It really should be a Marvel-level event that Gloria Bell sees Moore adding to her L.A. pantheon in a major way. Don't let the movie's deceptively banal title fool you -- this is as complete and full-bodied a performance as you're likely to see all year.
Gloria Bell,"Stands by itself nicely-a totally captivating yarn that gives Moore center stage to do the kind of rich, arresting work that actresses in their 50s can rarely find in Hollywood."
Gloria Bell,You won't find a more spellbinding performance than the inimitable star in the title role.
Gloria Bell,The film's open-ended narrative tends to be undermined by the simplicity of its thematic signifiers.
Gloria Bell,"It's Julianne Moore, more than any cast member, who's the reason to see Gloria Bell. Moore, and that fuzzy disco soundtrack, which keeps her dancing, and which will make you want to join in."
Gloria Bell,Chilean director Sebastián Lelio scores with his own English-language remake of his 2013 hit and Julianne Moore and John Turturro light up the screen as two fiftysomethings finding themselves on the L.A. dance-club scene.
Gloria Bell,"As a performer, Moore can go big, and a terrible yowl here pierces the heart. But she's a virtuoso of restraint."
Gloria Bell,Moore channels her inner awkwardness and vulnerability.
Gloria Bell,"Gloria Bell is almost an exact recreation of the original ... but there's enough freshness in the approach that makes [the film] a unique experience, funny and a little bit messy. The mess feels real."
Gloria Bell,"Playing a divorcé who refuses to go quietly into the invisibility of middle age, Moore dances her way through this intimate dramedy like the queen her character is."
Gloria Bell,"Moore is more relatable, a bit goofy, sometimes unsteady. Her sweet chemistry with Turturro as the fumbling Arnold is genuinely affectionate and sexy in a film that acknowledges the realism of sex and romance beyond your 20s."
Gloria Bell,"Extraordinary in its ordinariness, it's an empathetic portrait of a life that women around the world are living every day but rarely get to see on screen."
Gloria Bell,Minds a fine line between in-depth character study and offbeat romantic comedy.
Gloria Bell,"Gloria Bell has no deeper themes or motives beyond documenting a slice of the main character's life. Fortunately, she's the kind of person who's worth spending 100-odd minutes with."
Gloria Bell,"""Gloria Bell"" proves that the best stories can be told endlessly, so long as they're told well."
Gloria Bell,"Moore-vulnerable but undauntable-lives every moment in her skin, fantastic to the last glorious frame."
Gloria Bell,"For the millionth time, the female of the species is let down by the male, and that's that. The genius of Moore, though, is how plausibly, and how patiently, she fills the spaces of ordinary living."
Gloria Bell,"Gloria Bell pairs perhaps the best portrayer of troubled or lost women with a director who has built a career building stories around them, and the result is a film that comfortably banishes any fears of some neutered US remake."
Gloria Bell,"Lelio weaves some casual visual poetry into the film, bursts of color and motion that briefly hint at something surreal just on this film's margins. He mostly relies on Moore, though. With good reason!"
Gloria Bell,"It's a remarkably enjoyable movie, downright cathartic in its presentation of a three-dimensional character."
Gloria Bell,Gloria Bell maintains a warm but rigorously unsentimental tone despite material which could easily lend itself to mawkish sentimentality.
Gloria Bell,"Moore is great in the movie, uncovering - and sharing - all sorts of new facets to Gloria's character, but Turturro is a revelation..."
The Current War: Director’s…,"Fuelled by impressive performances from a sensational cast, The Current War is a sturdy, well-paced historical drama. The production values - its set design, cinematography, costumes - are particularly winsome."
The Current War: Director’s…,"It's a dizzying menu, aimed at eliminating any hint of fustiness and show that this is a story as modern as the rivalry between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. And I suppose it is. But it's also absorbing enough not to need any artificial means of support."
The Current War: Director’s…,"This is an interesting, well-filmed historical drama about a technological showdown that produced something we now all take for granted, as Edison predicted we would"
The Current War: Director’s…,"Despite a top-notch cast always worth watching, for a drama with war in its title, there's a lot of smoke and minimal fire."
The Current War: Director’s…,"Ultimately, the film sheds light on a fascinating episode in American history; it falls short, however, of being really electric."
The Current War: Director’s…,What I think really makes this film special is that it gives more of a role to Michael Shannon as George Westinghouse and talking about the financial risks that both of these men were taking. It kind of sets up the world we see today.
The Current War: Director’s…,"A movie about its making would be compelling, dynamic and a livewire rush. The thing itself is a dead end."
The Current War: Director’s…,The Current War: The Director's Cut is visually lucid but thematically scattershot.
The Current War: Director’s…,Even the likes of Thomas Edison would have to go back to the lab and do some tinkering to make this one shine.
The Current War: Director’s…,Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon avoids the too-often stuffy quality of prestige historical dramas with refreshingly dynamic camerawork and editing.
The Current War: Director’s…,"It's all a lot of effort for very little output, sadly. The Current War has lots of flashy lights and whizzy features, but it remains fatally underpowered."
The Current War: Director’s…,"It's a solid period piece that strives to be something more, and occasionally achieves it."
The Current War: Director’s…,"The score is at times stirring but ""The Current War"" feels like it's unsure of itself or the story it wants to tell. It has no spark."
The Current War: Director’s…,This cut of The Current War packs enough cinematic flash to be a fitting homage to the inventor of the kinetograph.
The Current War: Director’s…,"As constructed by director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, the scenes are so short and choppy as to undermine the performances, making the high-wattage actors looking little more than the players in dramatic reenactments."
The Current War: Director’s…,"Sumptuous sets and handsome costumes fill this period piece. There are also a few smart parallels to today's celebrity entrepreneurs, and to a world undergoing rapid technological change."
The Current War: Director’s…,"[Alfonso] Gomez-Rejon has dared to make a truly kinetic film about the past, one that never dabbles in creative anachronisms but feels like a truly modern view upon a bygone time."
The Current War: Director’s…,The fervor and intelligence Cumberbatch and Shannon bring to their roles make for a gripping experience.
The Current War: Director’s…,"""The Current War"" works well enough as a historical overview but never quite makes us care about the people at its center."
The Current War: Director’s…,It's a bit of a bore.
The Current War: Director’s…,"Essentially a long Wikipedia rabbit hole [that] could have been punishingly boring and dry. Fortunately, Gomez-Rejon recognized this potential, and has therefore thrown a whole heck of a lot of Filmmaking at it."
The Current War: Director’s…,The Current War is an actors showcase and everything is in service to the performances.
The Current War: Director’s…,"Mostly, ""The Current War"" plays like an article in a scientific magazine - packed with nuggets of data but mostly devoid of psychological insight."
The Current War: Director’s…,"The movie wants very much to look at the past as a window to the future, but not as much as it wants to look at everything from endlessly, fussily canted angles."
The Current War: Director’s…,"""The Current War"" is even better than it has to be."
The Current War: Director’s…,I never saw the earlier version. This one remains a bit of a mess but a pretty interesting one...
The Current War: Director’s…,"It all leaves a weirdly bitter taste, one that suggests it's less cool to want to leave a legacy of good deeds than it is to be famous for being first."
Run the Race,"Unequivocally a message-pushing drama, but one with a subtler touch and more artistic merit than many of its thematically linked predecessors."
Run the Race,"Run the Race has enough of a shaggy, low-key likability that it makes you wish it were better."
Run the Race,"""Run the Race"" lacks the specificity that would make it feel real to the audience."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Brittany Runs a Marathon gives Bell a lot of smart comic business, but her character's humour is signalled from the first as a way of deflecting pain - and is often funny because it's so mistimed that the people around her don't get the joke."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"It can't quite get itself tonally right...it didn't gel for me, but there are individual moments that are quite funny."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,Bell is terrific in the title role and the film as a whole is a confident combination of the amiable and the uncompromising.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"The trailer suggests a wacky DayGlo remix of Amy Schumer's body-conscious comedy I Feel Pretty, but don't believe it. This film, a debut from the writer-director Paul Downs Colaizzo, is made of sterner stuff..."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"There's a note of truth in Bell's finely tuned performance as a character whose insecurities have calcified over the years, hardening her to genuine goodwill, which she frequently misreads as pity."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,The strength of Brittany Runs a Marathon is that it doesn't claim to capture a universal experience. It tells one woman's story -- and it tells it well.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"It's a film with charm and sweetness but a twinge of anxiety, a little gravitational pull to darker places."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"You'll think of Trainwreck, but star Jillian Bell is not Amy Schumer. She's more Rebel Wilson synthesised with Lena Dunham."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Colaizzo gives us a vividly believable picture of what it's like to be youngish, single and in danger of losing your way in any big city where status can depend solely on a talent for keeping up appearances via an artfully arranged social media feed."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"It's a small, simple story with big themes, some of them rarely seen on screen."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"An uneven but essentially likeable story about the joys of setting yourself improbable goals and the tribes you can find as a result, with a strong, committed performance from Bell at its heart."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"With a pitch-perfect performance from Jillian Bell, Brittany Runs a Marathon is consistently honest in its conversations about weight, wellness, and self-worth."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"The highest mountain Brittany has to climb is getting over herself, a struggle Bell makes poignantly, piercingly real in her performance and that takes the film into its darkest yet most relatable moments."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,[W]hat should be an old-school audience pleaser winds up being a much more complicated film that is often at odds with itself.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"By the end, I was laughing and in tears, fully invested in Brittany's journey-as both a runner and a person."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"I too admire Colaizzo's effort, but in the end found myself ruminating on why I was expected to cheer at the finish line."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Yes, Brittany can be the worst. But when she's at her best, she's kinda great."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,Seeing how Brittany opens up as she learns to judge other people and herself less harshly is what makes this movie one of the summer's sweetest surprises.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Like the course of the New York City Marathon, this story takes some sharp twists and turns. And like the runners, viewers are going to have to strive to keep up."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"For fans of romantic comedies, one of the biggest pleasures of [Brittany Runs a Marathon] is seeing how a contemporary filmmaker works within the confines of the genre without sacrificing an ounce of body positivity."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"The movie succeeds because Bell succeeds. It's gratifying to see a so-called character actress with reliably deadly comic timing loosen up, stretch out and learn what it means to carry a movie."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Like its heroine, ""Brittany Runs a Marathon"" works its way up from the easy comic 2Ks to a more nuanced drama of self-confidence that's able to go the distance."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Brittany is funny and authentic, but she can also be prickly and stubborn, even hard to like. You know, the way real people are."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Brittany Runs a Marathon is perfunctory, idealized, sometimes awkwardly composed, almost always predictable. But it stays the course, with admirable grit and more than a few entertaining grins."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,Bell draws laughter and tears out of her character's indignities but also invests us greatly in her desire to change her own life.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Calaizzo's script is sharp, funny and honest, and nicely avoids movie cliches about obesity. Bell's performance is very good, both physically - the actress herself lost 40 pounds for the role - and emotionally."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"On balance, I admire the hell out of Collaizo for choosing to tell a more emotionally convoluted story, even if it sometimes kills the momentum."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"A soaring testament to the human spirit, the film is an entertaining cathartic joy that never shies away from the darker emotional complications that can arise when a person sets out try and better themselves and live a healthier life."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"In much of the same way seasoned runners make a marathon look easy, Bell makes leading this comedy look effortless."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Its first moments, with Brittany working as an usher at an off-Broadway theater are its funniest. But it grows increasingly earnest. That's part of the movie's charm but also what leads it a little off track."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Brittany Runs a Marathon is reaching for a freshness it doesn't really have and for an interest in unexplored lead characters it doesn't quite demonstrate. But if you don't expect too much, you likely won't leave disappointed."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"""Brittany"" not only goes places you won't be expecting but it also manages to be simultaneously sympathetic and unsentimental, a picture with a laugh-out-loud sense of humor that can be as real as hell when it needs to be."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"What starts out feeling inspirational threatens, at some points, to tip into disheartening conformity."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Bell... knows her way around a wisecrack. She also plays Brittany's transformation subtly and intelligently, without courting our pity or even our approval."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Bell imbues Brittany with humanity and wit, but all too frequently she is working within the framework of a story that seems hellbent on robbing her character of joy."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,Jillian Bell is a comic force of nature with real dramatic chops in this hilarious and heartfelt tale of a twentysomething whose body mass is heading into the obese zone unless she proves her worth to herself and not just by running the NYC marathon.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"""Brittany"" is a comedy so relatable for young New Yorkers, you might need to take a walk after watching it."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Brittany Runs A Marathon winds up feeling like a story told by an outsider who's empathetic toward, but not fully immersed in, a specific lived experience."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"The title more or less gives away the entire plot, which just goes to show that unpredictability can be overrated. Even a formulaic crowd-pleaser can be hard to resist if the formula is this well executed."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,The film is inspirational only in the sense that it may inspire an uptick in Amazon searches for running gear.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,Brittany Runs a Marathon is a sincere and delightful pep-talk for the soul.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Colaizzo successfully walks a fine line between inspiration and caution, never presenting Brittany as a patronizing role model for weight loss, nor a clichéd case of inner beauty."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"Aside from its cast, the winningest aspect of Colaizzo's script is Brittany's emotional arc, which avoids the expected path."
Brittany Runs a Marathon,A whip-smart comedy that manages to deliver genuinely funny uplift without ever swerving away from its own dark side.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,The greatest trick of Colaizzo's winning comedy: it doesn't need that cheese factor to inspire plenty of tears and cheers.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,Humor ends up being replaced by a cloying earnestness as the finish line comes into view. Do the self-deprecating remarks really need to vanish along with the weight? It's hard to imagine why.
Brittany Runs a Marathon,"This terrifically engaging debut feature by playwright Paul Downs Colaizzano is the best kind of ""crowdpleaser"": one that earns every emotional beat that might seem formulaic in four out of five similar enterprises."
Motherless Brooklyn,"If that sounds worthy, well-meaning and incredibly dull, I can only say that Norton makes it work, spinning it into a twisting narrative that, admittedly, does require your concentration."
Motherless Brooklyn,"The narrative and the characters are so interesting, and the whole theme...so riveting that Norton's immensely ambitious film succeeds as a compelling exercise in neo-film noir."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Motherless Brooklyn is a love-letter to the long-held focus across film noir on masculinity in crisis, but through Lethem's source material and Norton's deep engagement with it, something genuinely fresh explodes out of seemingly familiar material."
Motherless Brooklyn,"My only criticism is that it does take its time, because it's not afraid to indulge in its story...but those moment are far fewer than I thought, and the story is not hard to follow."
Motherless Brooklyn,"The rest is a sluggish film noir pastiche (the setting of the novel has been inexplicably shifted from the late Nineties to the Fifties) that aims to emulate the jazzy intrigue of Chinatown, but delivers only clichés and screen-chewing vanity."
Motherless Brooklyn,"There's something showy and calculated about the whole thing. Still, it's worth watching..."
Motherless Brooklyn,"As it is, his passionate commitment to the story has resulted in the very definition of a vanity project."
Motherless Brooklyn,I loved its imperfections almost as much as its beautifully stripped down and ramshackle quality.
Motherless Brooklyn,"Its homage to film noir is over-the-top and borderline parodic -- at times, it's more Who Framed Roger Rabbit? than Chinatown."
Motherless Brooklyn,"It took Norton two decades to get Motherless Brooklyn made, and the result is a film that's wondrously out of time: one in which the hero isn't out to save the world, just understand it."
Motherless Brooklyn,"A bloated, 145-minute crime flick with a gimmicky protagonist investigating a cliché-prone murder-and-corruption plot."
Motherless Brooklyn,"There's quite a bit to admire in Motherless Brooklyn, but mostly in detail work - the hats, the cars, the join-the-dots conspiracy theory - but it doesn't really catch fire as either a private-eye mystery or a study in Tourette syndrome savantry."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Fascinating though it is to see Norton continue Caro's work in scrutinising the legacy of one of Gotham's most influential and controversial figures, Norton's anti-capitalist message is undermined by his film's sentimental tendencies."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Motherless Brooklyn is not just nostalgic for the New York City it recreates, but fixated on the moment of its loss. Notes from Chinatown swirl like a saxophone solo as the birth of the city of the future and ponders the mystery of its parentage."
Motherless Brooklyn,I'm sure that the actor and director Edward Norton is often the smartest person in the room. But thinking one is the smartest person in the room can be a bad idea.
Motherless Brooklyn,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" wants to be taken seriously, but it's like a tip written on a matchbook that's been smudged out by the rain. It leads nowhere."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Motherless Brooklyn is so messy, confusing and pointless that you don't know what's going on half the time, and couldn't care less."
Motherless Brooklyn,...an effective mood piece and a worthy entry in the genre.
Motherless Brooklyn,"Motherless Brooklyn [is] a noble failure, but a failure nonetheless."
Motherless Brooklyn,"It's got giant scope, but it is so slow. It is a real slog to sit through... Also, Norton's performance is really mannered and over the top."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Still, the milieu and message of ""Motherless Brooklyn"" ring startlingly true, at a time when raw power, rank impunity and ruthless greed are as ascendant as ever."
Motherless Brooklyn,"In that sense, ""Motherless Brooklyn"" might be described as novelistic, and in a good way."
Motherless Brooklyn,"When brassy Cherry Jones shows up as a Jane Jacobs in all but name, shouting down the builders, you wish Norton would commit to the real-life showdown he'd clearly rather be making."
Motherless Brooklyn,"At best, the socio-historical drama version of Motherless Brooklyn is an interesting idea for a movie-one that should have stayed on the page."
Motherless Brooklyn,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" is the kind of knotty, ambitious, character-rich, politically conscious entertainment the studios so rarely get behind anymore, you can't help wishing it were better."
Motherless Brooklyn,"The story itself is like a jazz performance, improvisation based in deep understanding and skill."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Even if the big thematic statements are less than subtle, the story is solid and thought-provoking, and the performances are just stylized enough to match the intensity of Norton's deep-dive performance."
Motherless Brooklyn,"A mediocre municipal noir that's a copy of a copy of Chinatown, like an East Coast cover of L.A. Confidential."
Motherless Brooklyn,"I wish the bones of ""Chinatown"" weren't so evident. But if you're going to nod to a classic thriller, ""Chinatown"" is a good one to pick, and ""Motherless Brooklyn"" has many other things going for it..."
Motherless Brooklyn,Manages to seem like a paint-by-numbers detective story even as it ambles through a byzantine narrative.
Motherless Brooklyn,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" is done well enough that you wish it had struck out on its own path, rather than crib from Robert Towne and Roman Polanski. It's hard to forget it, but that's ""Chinatown."""
Motherless Brooklyn,"This is far from a perfect movie, but it's passionate, controlled and smart -- a throwback to another era of American cinema, not just American life."
Motherless Brooklyn,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" is a very smart movie, bristling with ideas about history, politics, art and urban planning."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Motherless Brooklyn may have no solid direction home, but it indeed walks the walk of a movie that knows the way."
Motherless Brooklyn,"In filming Jonathan Lethem's novel about a New York gumshoe with Tourette syndrome, writer-producer-director-star Edward Norton shows a few signs of artistic struggle, but nonetheless delivers an ardent and ambitious triumph."
Motherless Brooklyn,"It's easily half an hour longer than it needs to be, and it's full of moments that don't go anywhere."
Motherless Brooklyn,The precise attention given to the style of Motherless Brooklyn serves only to underscore the plot's mediocre execution.
Motherless Brooklyn,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" is a gorgeous-looking, beautifully acted film noir with a richly detailed script and sensitive direction from its star."
Motherless Brooklyn,"A sturdy, wordy politically minded and wholly engaging whodunit."
Motherless Brooklyn,"This film is amazing, and not in a good way."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Handsome and largely unfussy, visually evoking the grayness of late-autumn New York chill, it's a dad movie for dads who might alternate detective novels with Robert Caro's The Power Broker."
Motherless Brooklyn,This very iffy and frustrating experience is nearly saved by the enlightening bits of New York history.
Motherless Brooklyn,"It would take him two decades to get back to Motherless Brooklyn, which might explain why the film reeks of desperation in its indulgences."
Motherless Brooklyn,"At almost two and a half hours, ""Motherless Brooklyn"" could stand to be tightened up, but it's an engaging take on a genre that can fall easily into hacky cliches."
Motherless Brooklyn,The film feels both rudderless and hollow from the jump.
Motherless Brooklyn,"Whatever its flaws, it is a substantial and distinctive drama, unlike anything around in the cinema right now, although obviously like a lot of the gumshoe movies of yesteryear."
Motherless Brooklyn,"Motherless Brooklyn feels altogether too tidy, a film that revives many of the touchstones of noir, but never that throbbing unease that courses through the classics of the genre."
Motherless Brooklyn,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" takes its time getting to where it's going, and sometimes flies off the rails. But ultimately, it sticks its landing..."
Motherless Brooklyn,"A meticulously, lovingly made mood piece, full of empathy for the ones who can't speak - at least not always the way they want to - for themselves."
Motherless Brooklyn,"I miss this kind of story - told with jazz and intrigue, coal-black streets and smoky silhouettes - and Norton's filmmaking evokes it tenderly."
Motherless Brooklyn,"For New York City, a jagged enigma in constant motion, it's a fitting salute."
Motherless Brooklyn,An overdone epic of socio-political venality with clear designs on being viewed as an East Coast Chinatown.
Motherless Brooklyn,"Asprawling, ambitious tale of murder, blackmail and corruption in mid-century New York to rival ""Chinatown"" in its complexity, if not necessarily that brain-bender's elegance or appeal..."
The Best of Enemies,"It's predictable and conventional, but it has some powerful moments."
The Best of Enemies,"But like Peter Farrelly's road-trip dramedy, Bissell's film stretches and flattens history in ways big and small."
The Best of Enemies,"Comparisons will inevitably be made to Green Book for its upbeat vibe, but in terms of serious craft and admirable aspirations, this film is more in the league of 42 and Selma."
The Best of Enemies,"To give ally cookies to a former Klan president because he no longer believes Black people are ""evil and dirty"" is breathtaking. To reduce Ann's story to her friendship with this man as ""a more important story,"" is even more so."
The Best of Enemies,This tale of a KKK president seeing the error of his ways-and bonding with a civil-right activist-feels all kinds of wrong.
The Best of Enemies,"It's impossible to ignore that the film is yet another Hollywood narrative of racial reconciliation centered on a white protagonist-and worse, it's one that seems much more interested in the Klan's white targets than its black ones."
The Best of Enemies,"The film travels such an obvious path and falls into such a predictable rhythm, it doesn't quite carry the emotional resonance such a powerful true-life story should convey."
The Best of Enemies,"Bissell, from the start, is interested in perpetrators, not victims, in illustrations of plot points, not curiosity about context."
The Best of Enemies,The kind of easy-to-digest pablum that provides emotional catharsis and a safe space for white liberals to tut disapprovingly at racism.
The Best of Enemies,Bissell's fudging of the facts (which includes completely making up the reasons behind the charrette) doesn't create a story that's more insightful or dramatically cohesive than the real thing.
The Best of Enemies,"While The Best of Enemies may be met by stinging criticism from the far left and far right (for different reasons), those with centrist leanings will appreciate it for what it is (as opposed to for what it isn't)."
The Best of Enemies,"This movie isn't just tone-deaf, it's ass backwards. Did the filmmakers read the room before dropping this insulting malarkey into theaters?"
The Best of Enemies,"""The Best of Enemies"" may have the best of intentions, but a 2002 documentary, ""An Unlikely Friendship,"" offers a more illuminating look at this surprising chapter in history."
The Best of Enemies,"A thoughtful, sincere drama, beautifully performed with a touching conclusion."
The Best of Enemies,This sturdy drama has the good sense to recognize that allyship is only valuable when it's hard.
The Best of Enemies,"No doubt the world needs more paeans to tolerance, but movies as ineffectual as ""The Best of Enemies"" feel profoundly inadequate to the task."
The Best of Enemies,"The way the film implores its audience to see the humanity of both Ann's allies and the Klansmen reflects a cringeworthy image of Donald Trump saying, in the aftermath of Charlottesville, that there were ""some very fine people on both sides."""
The Best of Enemies,"Robin Bissel's film may be based on a true story, but it more accurately resembles an all-too-familiar Hollywood tall tale."
The Best of Enemies,Strong performances and a strange-but-true story keep this Civil Rights drama from succumbing to formula.
The Best of Enemies,"""The Best of Enemies"" is a pleasure to watch, thanks not only to Henson and Rockwell, but also to the meticulous recreation of the era."
The Best of Enemies,"I like this movie, especially now, because it puts a premium... on finding compromise and resolution the hard way: by getting to know your ideological adversary, and then doing something about what needs doing."
The Best of Enemies,"A rock-solid movie: squarely deliberate, a little long and predictable, but honest and thoughtful enough, precise in its period and locale, with very strong performances."
The Best of Enemies,"[W]hile it lacks the ambition to turn its obvious plot into a film that feels new, it also avoids the pitfalls of moral smugness and stereotyping."
The Best of Enemies,"Leads Henson (barely recognizable under a mountain of Tyler Perry-esque practical makeup) and Rockwell turn in top-notch, emotion-laden performances, buoyed by a supporting cast of equally fine character actors."
The Best of Enemies,The mostly short scenes are often overpowered by pop songs - including incongruous choices from Donovan and David Bowie's back catalogues - and Henson's performance is so broad it verges on farcical.
The Best of Enemies,The political moral of the movie is that change happens when the oppressed are nice to their oppressors.
Blinded by the Light,Most of the film's emotional weight is undermined by cheesy sing-alongs with the lyrics visualized in such a garish way that the supposed thematic significance bashes the audience in the head.
Blinded by the Light,The film feels authentic in its depiction both of Javed's family but also the changes that took place after what seems to have been akin to a religious conversion.
Blinded by the Light,"The deliberately amateurish style of the musical numbers is supposed to engender spontaneity but too often looks merely cack-handed. Nonetheless, you come out on a high. Springsteen fever proves to be contagious."
Blinded by the Light,"While it's far from perfect, on balance, it's an inoffensive, feel-good and inspirational British dramedy with some charming performances and an emotionally affecting story about an immigrant teenager and how he finds salvation in Springsteen's music."
Blinded by the Light,"Much of the film plays out in a predictable, if charming, way."
Blinded by the Light,"Despite its predictability, it conveys what it's like to be enraptured by a rock idol."
Blinded by the Light,"If you're seeking a cutesy movie with some recognizable songs, this will do."
Blinded by the Light,It is almost as if the movie's more noticeable imperfections only end up making the feature as a whole even more infectiously intoxicating.
Blinded by the Light,"Even when it feels as if we've seen this movie before, we've never seen it set to the sounds of the Boss, and we've never seen it from the point of view of this particular terrific kid and his family."
Blinded by the Light,"""Blinded by the Light"" represents such a sweet, easy-to-relate-to story that it deserves to be seen, at the least, by anyone who has shown a little faith that there's magic in the arts -- either in music, or a darkened theater."
Blinded by the Light,Watching the teenage Javed become his own man is the best time I've had at the movies this year.
Blinded by the Light,"Blinded by the Light at its very best, captures the experience of being a fan, the pure exhilaration of it, and the sense of your vision opening out to vistas beyond your horizon."
Blinded by the Light,"As in ""Bend it Like Beckham,"" Chadha's gift for kinetic storytelling reflects the turbulent emotion of the young protagonists."
Blinded by the Light,"It's a dream of inclusion that feels narrow, a vision of liberation that feels constrained, a view of progress that feels like a lockstep into the future."
Blinded by the Light,"""Nobody wins unless everybody wins,"" Springsteen likes to say. This little movie is a big winner."
Blinded by the Light,"A lesser film would have put more focus on Bruce himself, but Chadha wisely makes ""Blinded by the Light"" Javed's story."
Blinded by the Light,"While nothing that happens is surprising, nearly all of it is performed with soulfulness and conviction and charm."
Blinded by the Light,"It's far from subtle, more than a little sudsy, but also pleasingly direct and full of heart."
Blinded by the Light,"These songs have the power to move, inspire, make you dance. For the first time in my experience of Springsteen, they made me want to hide under my seat."
Blinded by the Light,"Joyous and funny even as it strikes the occasional melancholy chord, Blinded by the Light is a testament to the small miracle of how the right music manages to find us at just the right time..."
Blinded by the Light,"The movie is a lovely feel-good experience, even when it traverses certain cultural tropes and amplifies emotions beyond what you might rationally imagine."
Blinded by the Light,A jubilant story that's told with grounded honesty.
Blinded by the Light,"""Blinded by the Light"" isn't a new tune, but it's sung with an infectious passion and it captures something sincere about the globe-spanning, life-changing influence of great pop music."
Blinded by the Light,"Newcomer Kalra makes for an engaging protagonist, as believable in his life angst as he is in his Boss worship."
Blinded by the Light,"Blinded by the Light is a one-third Bruce Springsteen hagiography, one-third kitschy '80s recreation, and one-third feel-good father/son coming together. Surprisingly, however, it works."
Blinded by the Light,"The reality of intergenerational conflict is a given for ""Blinded by the Light,"" but nothing can stand up to the transformative power of the Boss. You can take that to the bank."
Blinded by the Light,"You don't have to love Bruce Springsteen with the all-consuming passion of Sarfraz Manzoor, the U.K. journalist whose memoir was adapted for the screenplay of ""Blinded By the Light,"" to find the film both deeply moving and utterly charming."
Blinded by the Light,A heartfelt ode to the promise of youth and the transformative power of music.
Blinded by the Light,"The film bottles a palpable emotion of unabashed joy, even when the rest of it seems to barely hold together."
Blinded by the Light,"Warm, funny, humane and deeply sincere, this ode to Bruce Springsteen, breaking free and belonging isn't content merely to revel in Springsteen's greatest hits - although it does, with vibrant, vicarious exhilaration."
Blinded by the Light,A no-hope British-Pakistani teen (dynamite newcomer Viveik Kalra) finds salvation in the music of Bruce Springsteen. Cornball? So what. Look for Gurinder Chadha's exuberant gift of a movie to hit you the same way.
Blinded by the Light,An old-fashioned blast in the best way: a smart crowd-pleaser that embraces both sweetness and complexity.
Blinded by the Light,It'll remind you of the importance of chasing dreams and loving yourself as well as others.
Blinded by the Light,Blinded By The Light is such a joyful ride that it's hard to quibble with its flaws.
Blinded by the Light,It's the film's more serious moments that stayed with me.
Blinded by the Light,"A celebration of how music can mean so much, especially when it hits you at a vulnerable time in your life."
Blinded by the Light,"The picture is sentimental, implausible and laboured. It is also among the most irresistibly entertaining films of the summer"
Blinded by the Light,Let Bruce's wisdom into your life. You don't have to be blind to the flaws of this film to view it as a ray of sunshine.
Blinded by the Light,"It's an entertaining and watchable film, with horribly convincing reconstructions of what shopping centres and jobcentres looked like in 1987."
Blinded by the Light,"Blinded by the Light succeeds in lowering your defences with a distinctively Chadha-esque blend of modesty and gumption - like most of her better films, it shouldn't work, but it does."
Blinded by the Light,Blinded by the Light strikes right to the heart of why [Bruce] Springsteen's work has had such an impact on culture.
Blinded by the Light,The film keeps threatening to overcook its fairytale optimism and undercook its characters' nourishing reality. But fidelity of time and place just about hold out.
Blinded by the Light,A unique real-life story that still hits many comfortingly familiar beats.
Blinded by the Light,An utter joy.
Blinded by the Light,Boundless enthusiasm can't disguise a paperthin plot and some knuckle-biting musical sequences.
Blinded by the Light,"Combining both the universality and specificity of Springsteen's music, Blinded By The Light is an exuberant anthem to the importance of music, the need to be seen and the hope of new possibilities."
Blinded by the Light,"If this mix of comical period drama, song, dance and magic realism occasionally feels forced, it's unlikely to really bother those who respond to its themes."
Blinded by the Light,Gurinder Chadha's effervescent film is a bit cheesy and extremely hard to resist.
Blinded by the Light,Blinded By The Light is a heartwarming and rollicking delight with a soundtrack that demands to be played loud and proud.
Blinded by the Light,Blinded By the Light is one of the most flawed films that still manages to be a great feel-good musical.
Blinded by the Light,"Practically bursting with its love for Springsteen, the movie builds past its formulaic story when it captures the euphoria of singing a song you love."
Blinded by the Light,"While this flimsy coming-of-age drama over-relies on the Boss's greatest hits for its emotional high points, ""Blinded by the Light"" remains a likeable and touching story about finding your own voice."
Blinded by the Light,"It's a big-hearted crowdpleaser that rollicks along at an irrepressibly giddy pace, but it's earnest to a fault; those with a low tolerance for corniness will struggle."
Blinded by the Light,"Corny, silly, as overblown as one of Springsteen's grandest anthems and damn near irresistible."
Blinded by the Light,A glorious and almost terminally pure coming-of-age story.
Blinded by the Light,I guarantee it will make you feel better than any other film that comes out this year.
Blinded by the Light,A Technicolor ode to the power of music so deeply tender and heartfelt that it disarms even the most misanthropic critic's instincts.
Blinded by the Light,"There's something so constructed and suffocating about watching a tried and tested formula not working, the over-sentimental string-pulling on show for all to see."
Blinded by the Light,"""Blinded by the Light"" marks an exuberant return to form."
Blinded by the Light,Newcomer Viveik Kalra radiates enough guileless enthusiasm to carry viewers past the film's rough patches.
After,It's a movie well made for its target audience.
After,"The key to the book's success lies in its artful amateurism. It replicates the tone of one teen confiding in another and in this anodyne screen translation, its intimacy is lost."
After,"The real problem with After is that it's a lifeless slog of thinly written clichés, one that's missing the charismatic spark of the actual One Direction boys."
After,"Come back, Twilight, all is forgiven."
After,"The kind of dispiriting effort that thinks it's scratching an itch for masochistic young girls, but primarily suggests that romance, desire and sexuality aren't worth genuinely exploring."
After,"The problems may lie in Todd's novel, but regardless, characters act illogically, as though written by someone who napped through most of Intro to Psych and skipped English 101 altogether."
After,"After opens with some narration about how certain moments in life seem to define a person, and from there, the clichés pretty much don't stop."
After,"An innocuous teen pulp soap opera that flirts with ""danger"" but, in fact, keeps surprising you with how mild and safe and predictable it turns out to be."
The Kitchen,ERROR
Unplanned,"Unplanned will make you writhe in agony over how such an ugly, malicious and potentially dangerous piece of religious and political propaganda could have made its way into this world."
Unplanned,"Writer-directors Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon spend more time making their talking points than developing their characters, who exist merely to make their arguments."
Unplanned,"One wonders why Unplanned, which resembles a basic cable television movie in its mediocre production values and subpar performances, was made."
Unplanned,"A kind of cinematic personal testimony, told from Johnson's post-conversion point of view...crafted specifically for Pure Flix's target audience, an audience that is already pro-life."
Unplanned,Abortion is a serious topic. This movie is ridiculous.
Unplanned,"They're performers in a parable traced over a Chick tract, filmed with a bland competence at odds with the true perversity of the material. Old-school Pure Flix: Welcome back!"
Unplanned,It's strictly set up to rally its base.
Unplanned,"""Unplanned"" preaches to the pro-life choir, and it does so by making a case against abortion that's absolutist and extreme, at certain points twisting ""facts"" into a narrative of conspiracy."
A Dog’s Journey,What if dogs really aren't this annoying when we get to hear inside their head? What if they're actually very smart or lovely?
A Dog’s Journey,"I went into it feeling a bit low and came out of it feeling a bit better. It's a reminder that sometimes there's a beauty in just going along with ordinary life, which is short, even more so for dogs."
A Dog’s Journey,"If there are to be more sequels, I'm hoping that future Baileys cut the chat and hark back to a time when heroism trumped cuteness and movie dogs left the punchlines to the human members of the cast."
A Dog’s Journey,"A Dog's Journey is a series of moments, tenuously connected with little impact or consequence, with Josh Gad narrating the whole thing in an increasingly irritating juvenile tone."
A Dog’s Journey,"This is the type of movie where all characters are either ""good"" or ""bad,"" nothing in between, and the only emotions are ""happy"" and ""sad."" It's as if it was written from the emotional mindset of a dog."
A Dog’s Journey,"There are plenty of ""awwww"" moments to go around, with reconciliation, support, and reunion, and plenty of human and canine characters to care for."
A Dog’s Journey,It's about halfway through the film when one realizes how much deeper Mancuso and team are going with this dog's journey... It's about how dogs can fill the hole in your heart that a person might leave.
A Dog’s Journey,"Is A Dog's Journey one of the sweetest canine films out there, or one of the meanest?"
A Dog’s Journey,"I enjoyed the film, as many will, in a split-brain way that goes to the essence of fantasy -- half-believing what I wanted to be true, embracing the emotional manipulation whenever possible."
A Dog’s Journey,"A Dog's Journey ends in bittersweet fashion, but with the suspicion that this franchise will live on."
A Dog’s Journey,"It's less egregiously tonally divided than A Dog's Purpose, but still the same weird mix of tearjerking dog death, soapy drama, and kid-friendly comedy."
A Dog’s Journey,"The love we share with our canine companions is one of the simplest emotions there is, and to build an entire film around manipulating that love is lazy storytelling."
A Dog’s Journey,A corny but effective tearjerker for kids and families.
A Dog’s Journey,I suppose it's a genuine achievement that a movie packed with as much delightful canine (and agreeable human) talent as this one should be so insufferable.
A Dog’s Journey,"Director Gail Mancuso, a TV comedy veteran, gets the desired effect-as manipulative as it may be-out of both the funny scenes and the sad ones, leading up to a finale that can only be described as weapons-grade tearjerker material."
A Dog’s Journey,"Even the crustiest viewers (count me among them) must credit director Gail Mancuso for a handful of sequences that, amid all the glop, are capable of softening a hard heart."
A Dog’s Journey,"I literally had tears going down my face about three times, even as my rational brain was saying, ""don't you dare get sucked in by this!"""
A Dog’s Journey,A steady stream of corn-syrup sentiment binding what would otherwise amount to a feature-length montage of adorable doggy reaction GIFs.
A Dog’s Journey,"Is A Dog's Journey manipulative? Absolutely. Is it effective? Hell, yes."
A Dog’s Journey,"Only its restlessness feels novel, tailored as it is to wet-nosed viewers made distractible by hours of scrolling through floof-centric Instagram feeds."
A Dog’s Journey,"It's preposterous, not half as much fun as last time and, crucially, not at all sad."
A Dog’s Journey,"This is hardly one for the cynics. It's a big, wet, sloppy lick of a film that's going to jerk your tears, and then some."
A Dog’s Journey,"It quietly boosts a message of resilience and self-belief to young girl audiences, advising them that it's always a smarter move to love nice boys and dogs rather than abusive jerks and pet haters."
A Dog’s Journey,"There is apparently a sizable overlap between people who like films in which cute dogs scamper around happily, and people who like films in which cute dogs drop dead every half an hour."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,For all of the talent of its cast and crew this adaptation of Stein's best-seller stalls out on the track long before it has the chance to reach the finish line.
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"I feel like this device probably works a lot better on the page... It is so mawkish, smothered in cloying anthropomorphism from start to finish."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"It's laughably contrived and shamelessly calculating. Dog's bollocks, but not in a good way."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Cancer is to melodrama what CGI is to the MCU: a cheap, easy tool to control audience emotions used by filmmakers (in this case, director Simon Curtis and scenarist Mark Bomback) who have nothing to sell but tripe."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,I wanted a refund on every lump in the throat and teary-eyed moment I had experienced...
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Even with the occasional dollop of dog-related humor, The Art of Racing in the Rain feels as ponderous as its title."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"As is, this tale of friendship and companionship between man and man's best friend is bogged down in weepy cliches ripped straight from the Art of Making the Audience Cry handbook."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"A strong contender for most ridiculous tearjerker of the year, starring Kevin Costner as a golden retriever."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,A clumsy potboiler that is that is long on melodrama yet strangely short on racing sequences and interesting animal behavior.
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"In a period obsessed with the inner thoughts of dogs, Enzo's witty yet heartfelt existentialism is refreshing, and thankfully lacking in squeaky diversions."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"You're not experiencing the big moments yourself, you're just experiencing Enzo experiencing them, leaving you to wonder if the story and performances alone are anything special without the dog's metaphors and poeticisms."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" mostly feels like a sentimental slog, punctuated by (admittedly adorable) very long close-ups of Enzo's handsome doggy face while Costner, all raspy and folksy, intones lines like ""I was meant to be his dog."""
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"The Art of Racing in the Rain feels like such a jumble of half-formed ideas and grudging creative concessions that I was astonished to learn at the end that it had been adapted from a book, and not a month-long argument in a writers' room."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,It could all be so winsome and adorable-but it isn't.
The Art of Racing in the Rain,A film aimed with lethal efficiency at your tear-ducts like Chuck Norris putting his boot into your kidneys.
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Enzo is a bad dog, and his antics play worse for the film's lack of discipline."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"[It's] arguably just a feature-length interpretation of the joke everyone says when a dog jumps up onto a couch: 'Aw, look, he thinks he's people!'"
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"It's a PG movie with pleasantly canned life lessons, and it's safe for kids and adults alike, although anyone with a shred of cynicism may not want to be seen caving in to the script's emotional inevitabilities."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"The dog drops banal pearls of wisdom as if he were pooping on a rug or peeing on the floor (which he does often, and to the same effect)."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"One would hope that perhaps a film filled with such melodrama and pathos would unearth an observation about the existential nature of life and death beyond ""racing cars is fun."" But after all that philosophizing, that's all Enzo leaves us with."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,The film is not really that bad.
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Ultimately, The Art of Racing in the Rain has a dog's pure-heartedness that manages to beat strongly despite generic direction, milquetoast performances, and twelve cubic tons of Costner voiceover."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,This is the kind of sentimental dramedy that leaves no emotional trigger unpulled.
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Only the most sentimental pet lovers will be able to get past the self-indulgent pretentiousness of the narration, and even they may find it troubling to be told a dog's highest purpose is to become human."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"It might be built on the notion that dogs are the wisest of us all, but the end result winds up stupid."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Who can resist cute dog stories, even if it is the centerpiece of a sappy film and the dog has Kevin Costner's voice?"
The Art of Racing in the Rain,The film peddles in the simplistic anthropomorphization that's become a hackneyed trope in numerous Hollywood dog-centric movies.
The Art of Racing in the Rain,Some heartfelt performances and an adorable dog aren't quite enough to combat the sentimentality and contrivances.
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"This sentimental slog about the relationship between a golden retriever and the growing family of a race car driver is, under director Simon Curtis' no-nonsense stewardship, about as box-checked and rubber-stamped as mainstream entertainment gets."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"While Ventimiglia and Seyfried are appealing actors, the story's human element just isn't that interesting."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"The Art Of Racing In The Rain will play well for those who consider their pets to be full-fledged family members, but otherwise this dog's journey lacks a purpose or any sense of artistry."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"There isn't anything astoundingly different about this film. It's about a dog, and it's absolutely cute and sweet. It's also predictably heartwarming and it offers nothing new."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Watchable but flat, with only occasional flashes of wit and feeling."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Rain is not a bad movie, really, and it doesn't sell itself as anything other than earnest, floppy-eared family entertainment."
The Art of Racing in the Rain,Effective on its own dog-forsaken terms.
Overcomer,"Kendrick's film eventually finds its legs in the final stretch, with an emotionally effective conclusion that might persuade even the cynics to its cause."
Overcomer,"Scene after rambling scene, everyone in front of the camera spells out the script's messaging with verbose, bold-faced statements that do nothing to improve the overall quality of the cast's efforts. Overacting runs rampant."
Overcomer,"The whole is cheap, cheesy, and, to put it charitably, churchy."
Overcomer,"""Overcomer"" offers nothing in the way of nuance - even its title is awkward - and, also, no respite from its religious propagandizing."
Overcomer,What seemed like a moderately boring teen movie with a predictable ending in sight is suddenly transformed into an extended sermon on the miraculous powers of prayer.
Breakthrough,"This is a lot better crafted, acted, and has a better cast than a lot of these kinds of films ordinarily do."
Breakthrough,"There is literally one moment in which it raises an interesting theological problem, then goes right back to what it was doing before...a movie designed to preach to the choir."
Breakthrough,Here is another illustration of how the faith-based drama has pushed into cinemas material indistinguishable from vast swathes of the afternoon TV schedule.
Breakthrough,"A bold tale of faith is lifted by some decent performances, however the inert narrative breaks the spell."
Breakthrough,"As the film's saccharine sanctimoniousness swells, the intendedly God-awesome turns to the increasingly God-awful."
Breakthrough,"Another glib and unconvincing faith-based movie that pushes miracles, spirituality and divine intervention, hoping for box-office gold. A terrific cast is the only thing that saves it from last rites."
Breakthrough,"one of the more authentically moving entries in the genre, fueled by a gripping lead performance from ""This Is Us"" star Chrissy Metz."
Breakthrough,It's a harrowing tale that deserves a much better movie than this insipid junk.
Breakthrough,"We may not agree on why John recovers. This cast makes us glad and relieved that he does, even if the story veers into smugness that undermines its message."
Breakthrough,A mostly preachy but occasionally compelling dramatization of a true story.
Breakthrough,"That, perhaps, is the role movies like Breakthrough serve. They are simple sermons dressed up in seductive trappings of Hollywood cinema."
Breakthrough,"Less a story than it is a sermon, aimed directly at the choir and nobody else."
Breakthrough,"""Breakthrough"" might be the first faith-based Hollywood film with genuine crossover appeal."
Breakthrough,"""Breakthrough"" glibly peddles miracles but is honest enough to admit that not everybody gets one."
Breakthrough,You don't have to believe in divine intervention to be moved by this story.
Breakthrough,"Lots of small, potentially affecting dramas buzz around the center of Breakthrough before the movie swats them away to focus on the power of prayer."
Breakthrough,"For a movie focusing so intently on personal faith, it doesn't much trust your independent capacity to find religious, spiritual, or other meaning in what is truly an amazing story."
Breakthrough,"I found myself being dismissed as a viewer, being directed to put my confidence in a story layered in the superficial aspects of faith, to trust without question that prayer conquers all, even as the film provides no foundation as to why I should."
Breakthrough,"""Breakthrough"" tests how much audiences are willing to believe of a scenario that, though based on a true story, seems too undercooked for any kind of movie treatment."
Breakthrough,"""Breakthrough""... presents itself as the true story of a modern miracle. But it's also a portrait of what religious faith looks like when there's no pesky doubt to get in the way."
Breakthrough,This inspirational story directed by Roxann Dawson benefits from strong performances and a minimum of treacly preaching.
A Dog’s Way Home,Wall-to-wall voiceover... Lassie never had to explain herself.
A Dog’s Way Home,"It touches on ongoing problems in modern society such as homelessness and the postwar physical and psychological suffering of soldiers, and on the growing use of animal-based therapy."
A Dog’s Way Home,There's not much variation on the old themes here. What's new is the film's definition of community and family.
A Dog’s Way Home,"A decent, and very old-fashioned, family film."
A Dog’s Way Home,"Some kids may find the whole affair traumatic, particularly when the poor pooch finds herself dehydrated and chained to a corpse in the wilderness"
A Dog’s Way Home,"Cameron's tale grossly oversimplifies complex issues... to the point that it reduces much of the film's social justice message to meme-ready, empty-headed pap."
A Dog’s Way Home,"When the story lags, these are the flaws that pester, and even the cute factor of ""A Dog's Way Home"" can't obscure its narrative weaknesses."
A Dog’s Way Home,"Heartwarming, mildly funny, and occasionally thrilling without ever being anything more than just fine."
A Dog’s Way Home,A good dog movie with its heart in the right place.
A Dog’s Way Home,"I laughed and I cried and I said, ""Aww,"" and that is not a bad way to begin the year."
A Dog’s Way Home,"Although it might be a stretch to categorize this as a movie, ""A Dog's Way Home"" is harmless enough and a nice little adventure that's fit for the whole family. But you might want to have the tissues ready."
A Dog’s Way Home,"""A Dog's Way Home"" doesn't do anything new with the formula, but it does deliver exactly what it promises - a movie that's cute, with just enough tension to not scare youngsters."
A Dog’s Way Home,"This franchise should follow its own advice: Find a purpose, a way home, or show yourself the doggy door."
A Dog’s Way Home,"It's a dog of a movie, alright."
A Dog’s Way Home,"""A Dog's Way Home"" is a joyless jaunt that offers an adorable canine star and not much else."
A Dog’s Way Home,"Director Charles Martin Smith plows through the darker material at a relentlessly cheerful kids'-movie clip, for an incongruous marriage of tone and subject matter that's honestly a bit unsettling."
A Dog’s Way Home,"This family-friendly adventure, reminiscent of 'The Incredible Journey,' follows a tried-and-true but heartwarming path."
A Dog’s Way Home,Dog lovers of all ages will warm up to its adventure tale about a plucky pooch who embarks on a 400-mile journey to get back home to his beloved owner.
A Dog’s Way Home,"As ridiculous as it gets, and that's plenty, ""A Dog's Way Home"" manages to serve up a one- to two-hankie finale, depending on the extent of your dog-person-ness."
Five Feet Apart,"There's a sincerity here that undoes many of its excesses, thanks largely to the grounded chemistry of its leads."
Five Feet Apart,"There's a million books like this and a million movies like this, where people are beautiful -- but they're sick!"
Five Feet Apart,"The plot is believable - right up to the heart-in-the-mouth turns near the end - and the dialogue sounds real. That is a good start in any movie, but in this case it powers on from there because of the A-grade performances of the two young leads."
Five Feet Apart,"Sprouse and Richardson are proven heavyweights in the young-adult pocket of Hollywood, but this soft-hearted teen romance spreads on sugary sentiment too thickly to leave a lasting message."
Five Feet Apart,I cried. I was moved by it... the film was done in a manner that seemed good-hearted.
Five Feet Apart,"Richardson and Sprouse attack their roles with gusto, never patronising the material."
Five Feet Apart,"[Richardson] surely realises, as Fault's Shailene Woodley did before her, that this is the kind of marshmallow martyrdom that has to be briskly worked through before they let you at the grownup scripts."
Five Feet Apart,"Perhaps the fault lies not in our stars, but in our shameless need for a sappy ending."
Five Feet Apart,A flawed and deeply contrived story about an impossible love which adds almost nothing to the current trend for Sick-Lit adaptations.
Five Feet Apart,"It's the best tear-jerker in a long time; one box of tissues might not be enough. On a deeper level, it earns some of that emotion through a story based on a real dilemma."
Five Feet Apart,"Like a heart monitor's beep, it fades into the background quickly."
Five Feet Apart,Strong performances from Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse can't redeem a plot that encourages sacrifice as love-an idea so many teen-focused romances can't seem to advance past.
Five Feet Apart,"While mawkishness should not be a prerequisite for the sick-teens-in-love genre, the popularity of the two in concert has likely convinced many filmmakers that the opposite is true."
Five Feet Apart,Due credit... should be given to Sprouse and particularly Richardson for selling all of these reheated tropes to their full potential.
Five Feet Apart,...phoney emotions and baloney contrivances...
Five Feet Apart,"Offers a solid showcase for its young leads, Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse, while laboring to flesh out a complete movie."
Five Feet Apart,"Richardson may be the best thing about this Velveeta-slathered heap of lukewarm cliche, but she is merely a vicarious vehicle for thwarted teenage longing directed at the bad-boy dreamboat heartthrob of countless high-school-girl fantasies."
Five Feet Apart,"A melodrama without any bite to it, Five Feet Apart is clichéd and exploitative."
Five Feet Apart,"That doesn't dampen the work of Richardson and Sprouse, or the romance at the film's center. ""Five Feet Apart"" works hard for its tears. But it's the honesty of the performances that makes it worth the investment."
Five Feet Apart,It is tempting to dismiss this story as 'sick-lit' but director Justin Baldoni balances the compelling specifics of CF with the larger questions we all face.
Five Feet Apart,"Sprouse and Richardson make for one of the more adorable pairs in recent films. You not only want what's best for them, but believe it can actually happen."
Five Feet Apart,"Richardson can do just about anything, and her performance in ""Five Feet Apart"" demonstrates a new depth to her range. She brings a knowing soulfulness to every aspect of Stella's journey"
Five Feet Apart,"The honesty of the actors and their commitment to each other bails the movie out. They manage to find truth in a highly manipulative situation, and that's something even the least stardust-sprinkled among us can appreciate."
Five Feet Apart,"Cutting through the thick curtain of recycled lovey-dovey remarks and the proficiently dull craftsmanship of the production, Richardson's radiant charisma acts as a lifeline."
Five Feet Apart,"It's just another three-hankie teen weepie, albeit one with the saving grace of another excellent Haley Lu Richardson performance that gooses the film just past serviceable into the realm of slightly better than average."
Five Feet Apart,"Even amidst the sniffles and tears, there's a sense that the experience could have been more wrenching and emotionally honest had the filmmakers showed a greater trust in their material and audience."
Five Feet Apart,"There's something a wee bit icky about how cleverly its premise exploits the quirks of a terminal affliction, but there's no way around the fact that this movie has a future beyond its profit margins."
Five Feet Apart,"In the film, hardly any fact about cystic fibrosis is raised without being doubly, even triply, underlined for viewers."
Five Feet Apart,"It's predictable, and over the top, but you kind of knew that going in."
Five Feet Apart,"First-time feature director Justin Baldoni treats the tidy if increasingly shameless script as sincerely as possible, albeit with as many hackneyed montage sequences as possible."
Five Feet Apart,"At 116 minutes, ""Five Feet Apart"" is too much of a just-OK thing. All the same, I want to see Haley Lu Richardson's next movie."
Five Feet Apart,What starts as a promising film that takes the disease seriously and might even raise awareness about its challenges quickly turns into a romantic melodrama that checks all the familiar boxes.
Five Feet Apart,"The last act is a supernova of shamelessness. But even then, this weepie is tough to resist entirely."
Five Feet Apart,"It's a weird little genre, the sick-teen romance. ""Five Feet Apart"" winds up as just a pedestrian entry in it, because it tries way too hard on the melodrama front."
Five Feet Apart,In the end... even Richardson and Sprouse can't fully overcome the clumsy mawkishness around them.
Five Feet Apart,A first-rate teen romance with engaging characters and appealing stars.
Five Feet Apart,"Richardson gives a star turn every bit as charismatic and assured as the film is formulaic and forgettable, bringing soul, style and nuance to a character that could have easily been a condescending caricature."
Rocketman,"Rocketman is, in some ways, a sad reminder that even in its most supposedly fantastic imaginings, Hollywood fantasies can still be so straight."
Rocketman,"It's Taron Egerton as Elton John who carries and sells the film -- often backwards and in platform heels. Wild as it may sound to approach such a mercurial and marvelous character with beautiful restraint, Egerton's performance is meticulously calibrated."
Rocketman,"Rocketman ramps the camp up to 11, throws on some sequinned spectacles, and sparks fireworks of pure joy in glitzy song-and-dance routines."
Rocketman,"Rocketman isn't a sanitised peek-a-boo of someone's life, barely teasing at the surface of a complex creative genius. Rocketman gives you the warts and all version, and it's not going to pink-wash John's sexuality."
Rocketman,"Really, on the basis of ""Rocketman,"" you'd think Elton John never had a moment of fun."
Rocketman,"Like the Elton John it presents, it's about forgiveness. Love is love is love. Watching so many plume-festooned costumes take wing, you're inclined to believe that hope really is the thing with feathers."
Rocketman,It's hard to pinpoint any real flaws in this movie...the movie is enlivened by its own approach.
Rocketman,"""Rocketman"" is far from a drama of introspection-and, unfortunately, Egerton's performance, as directed by Fletcher, doesn't add to the protagonist's inner life."
Rocketman,[It's] an unexpected performance by a relatively untried actor in the central role anchors Rocketman.
Rocketman,Director Dexter Fletcher's energetically emotional musical is fantastically entertaining.
Rocketman,"Taron Egerton, his square jaw notwithstanding, throws body and soul into this origin story about the iconic British singer-performer."
Rocketman,"Rocketman is a cannily honed machine, absolutely sure of its purpose, so you rather feel you've been sold a complete deluxe package... at times, consumer satisfaction is taken care of a little too aggressively for you to really feel involved."
Rocketman,"Rocketman has unusual dramatic heft for a jukebox musical, but that's a big curve on which to grade - the characters are still skin-deep."
Rocketman,Rocketman never quite finds the wild momentum its characters seem to chase around in all those musical numbers.
Rocketman,"There is nothing timid about the storytelling. Which is exactly how it should be, because this is the life of an extraordinary singer and showman."
Rocketman,Fletcher is one of the few directors working today who really knows how to stage this sort of lavish musical number for the camera.
Rocketman,"The biopic about gay rock icon Elton John is proudly queer, packed with spectacle, and-though streaked with trauma and tragedy-radiant with joy."
Rocketman,The pop icon is vividly brought to life in this kaleidoscopic biopic.
Rocketman,"If you need somebody to recount the rise of a British rock god from pallid suburbia to the baroque extremes of fame, and to create a stir without causing too much of a fuss, Fletcher is your man."
Rocketman,"In real life, Elton John is not only a great songwriter and showman; he is a survivor. But the celebratory final moments of Rocketman can't compensate for the often-dreary narrative that leads up to them"
Rocketman,"We see the energy and magnetism of Sir Elton as a performer, and as the person, vulnerable, scared, and longing to be truly accepted."
Rocketman,"The story reshuffles reality, especially time and facts, and the film is more enjoyable for it."
Rocketman,Fletcher isn't seeking to reinvent a very practiced storytelling formula; he's just perfecting it.
Rocketman,"Although the movie will be rightfully and enthusiastically embraced by the singer's fans, it has something to offer those with no more than a casual recognition and appreciation of the man's music."
Rocketman,Rocketman grows exhausting by the end...
Rocketman,"The songs, the color, the dancing and, yes, the redemption are all intended to make people happy. And will."
Rocketman,"This dizzy, delirious jukebox musical has the energy and visual dynamism to truly reflect the outlandish aesthetic and performance style of its subject."
Rocketman,"Which is to say that as long as ""Rocketman"" is charting the jet-propelled rise of Elton John in the early 1970s, it is an absolute gas."
Rocketman,"""Rocketman"" is as weird, brazen and stylish as the man at its center."
Rocketman,"Egerton is commanding throughout. His performance is truly a marvel. ""Rocketman"" as well."
Rocketman,"This is rock storytelling as entertainment, not a social chronicle like Woodstock or Gimme Shelter."
Rocketman,Egerton's electric performance as the famed rock star drives this jukebox musical.
Rocketman,"The easy thing to do is hone an impression, but Egerton digs in deeper and finds the man inside the costume."
Rocketman,"Starring the overly strenuous Taron Egerton, Rocketman is a campy, overblown, self-glorifying fantasia."
Rocketman,"A cathartic outpouring of a lifetime's load of hurts and grudges. Fortunately for us, it's expressed in some of the most exuberant pop songs ever produced and it's lavishly adorned with stardust and sequins."
Rocketman,"A wildly entertaining (if a bit unwieldy) story of how Elton John went from neglected kid to outrageous, hit-making rock star."
Rocketman,Dexter Fletcher makes your basic Freudian gin and tonic... with a showstopping crowd pleaser.
Rocketman,"Rocketman is a fun, poignant rhinestone of a movie that proves that a musical biopic can be a powerful force - if done right."
Rocketman,"It's whimsy, magic and metaphor."
Rocketman,It helps that Egerton so masterfully rises to the challenge of inhabiting the role in ways that go beyond a certain more-than-passing physical resemblance to the man or the fact that he does his own singing and handles the choreography with ease.
Rocketman,"The young, gay, conflicted and addicted Elton John is brought to life by an electrifying, Oscar-caliber Taron Egerton and Dexter Fletcher's dazzling cinematic inventiveness. Forget the cliches, this one you don't want to miss."
Rocketman,"The point of ""Rocketman"" isn't self-aggrandizement. It's fan service of an especially and characteristically generous kind."
Rocketman,"Rocketman is a fun, trippy hallucinogen."
Rocketman,"As much as ""Rocketman"" reminds of just how many outstanding songs Elton John has recorded, it also digs into the pain and emotion that lie within those toe-tapping treasures."
Rocketman,"Egerton gives a performance with such thrills and vulnerability, such charisma and pathos, that it's hard not to be wowed."
Rocketman,"For me, Fletcher is the real star of this show, a director whose enthusiasm for musical storytelling shines through every frame, hitting all the emotional high notes. I have yet to come down."
Rocketman,"Rocketman manages to be campy and yet sincere, serious and yet ridiculous, profound and yet silly, and quite wonderful. Just like Elton himself."
Rocketman,"An uneven combination of strong performances, an insightful script (by Lee Hall) and iffy musical numbers, ""Rocketman"" is inventive and enjoyable, even when it teeters unsteadily on the platform heels of its own ambition."
Rocketman,"There may be a showbiz biopic to come that matches Rocketman for wit, energy, charm, candour and shameless exuberance. But I think it's gonna be a long, long time."
Rocketman,There's a lot of Technicolor flair in Dexter Fletcher's flamboyant study of Elton John - and a beating heart in... Taron Egerton's portrayal of an artist whose prodigious talent was matched only by his personal demons and a desperate hunger for love.
Rocketman,"Rocketman is dazzling! Dexter Fletcher and Taron Egerton are proving to be a standout filmmaking duo. The music and fantasy elements are staggeringly enchanting, and the movie also delivers a deeply moving exploration of isolation and forgiveness."
Rocketman,"[Egerton] captures the Elton-ness of Elton without ever resorting to mimicry, and he does his own singing which, astonishingly, also captures the Elton-ness of Elton."
Rocketman,"As a singer Egerton lands somewhere between Elton John and William Hung, but regardless he feels the words deeply and has so much charisma that his red blood cells may well be sequins."
Rocketman,"Oozing with moments of high camp and of utter euphoric joy, Rocketman does a great job in capitalising on John's impressive back catalogue of catchy rock anthems to give us one of the greatest rock biopics of the decade."
Rocketman,Crushingly literal... More redolent of a Christmas round-robin letter than of anything resembling cinema.
Rocketman,"Because the film is a cartoon bus, we don't care if the road is often familiar."
Rocketman,"Whatever the film's shortfall in psychodynamics, Rocketman invokes the spirit and specifics of music -- enormously aided by Mr. Egerton's performance -- to illuminate the hero's soul."
Rocketman,(mostly) distract us from its superficiality.
Rocketman,"Pure Elton [John], and pure pleasure."
Rocketman,"Like its flamboyant subject, it's a movie outfitted to the nines in dazzle and verve, even if it's gotten all dressed up with nowhere to go but the most conventional places."
Rocketman,"As inventive as the movie gets in teasing out both the melancholy and the joy of John and Taupin's songs, Rocketman still genuflects toward the myth of biopic respectability."
Rocketman,"Rocketman is magnificent and ridiculous, a feathered melanage of clichés and originality, of respectful homage and unrepentant nostalgia."
Rocketman,It's whenever the songs begin that the film truly finds its feet.
Rocketman,"It's a satisfying and even rousing film at times, but it doesn't provide much enlightenment."
Rocketman,"Rocketman sometimes feels like it's lost its way, especially near the end. But it's still a joyous celebration, a colorful story about love that can help people heal."
Rocketman,"It finds strength in texture, beauty in sadness, and an inspired finale in a crackpot arrangement of one of the singer's greatest hits."
Rocketman,The thing is an absolute hoot.
Rocketman,A dense jukebox musical variation on A Christmas Carol...
Rocketman,"Rocketman aspires to nothing more than colourful reportage of a life already well-known to the public, dissolving into an encyclopedia entry as the final title cards inform us that things turned out alright for this ""Elton John"" fellow."
Rocketman,"A rock star origin story that flaunts its hero's superpowers as if he were the newest member of the Avengers, ""Rocketman"" is shameless in its ambitions to crown Elton John as one of music's greatest artists, most fascinating figures and saddest souls."
Rocketman,"Taron Egerton, in a fantastic performance, doesn't impersonate Elton John, he becomes him; he doesn't lip-sync, he sings, making the songs matter in that moment in the story."
Rocketman,A sequin-encrusted delight. On paper it reads like a by-the-book biopic; on screen it explodes with the kind of colour and energy that only Elton John himself could invoke.
Rocketman,"As with its beloved subject and his enormous catalog of multiplatinum earworms, the movie's familiarity turns out to be crucial to its charm."
Rocketman,"The songs explode from the screen, time jumps catapult the story forward with exhilarating élan and even the emotional stuff lands, for the most part."
Rocketman,"Dexter Fletcher has fashioned an ebullient monument to pop superstar Elton John - featuring a likable turn from Taron Egerton in the lead role - that's clichéd in the telling, but gets by on the strength of his early catalog."
Rocketman,"It's largely to the credit of star Taron Egerton, who leans fearlessly into the role's wild excesses, that the movie remains airborne."
Rocketman,[Director Dexter] Fletcher films even the darkest scenes in a very flamboyant fashion and manages to leaven matters with some ironic humour.
Rocketman,"Dexter Fletcher's fabulous Elton John musical is a heart-racing, toe-tapping, all-glitter-cannons-blazing triumph..."
Rocketman,"Rocketman is an honest, heartfelt tribute to Elton John's music and his public image."
Downton Abbey,"Downton Abbey brings out the snob in everyone, but it also confounds the snob in everyone: just when you think you’re above it all... someone will show someone else an unexpected kindness, and you’re a puddle again."
Downton Abbey,Downton Abbey: A New Era is cinematic escapism at its finest and perhaps that’s all it should be.
Downton Abbey,"The second film continuation of the Brit series knows it’s old-hat and out of touch. But it’s also comforting fan service and if you can shut out the real world in favor of a fantasy remembrance of things past, you’re in for a treat."
Downton Abbey,"While not showing any interest in deviating from proven formula, A New Era does exactly what you hope it would do, and gives series fans a little more time with beloved characters, even daring to alter the status quo in one or two major ways."
Downton Abbey,There is no gas in the tank; there is no water in the well.
Downton Abbey,"The trials and tribulations of passive income earners, where every other scene seems to be a discussion over tea and crumpets on who is inheriting what, is almost delightfully absurd this time around."
Downton Abbey,"The new “Downton Abbey” movie eventually won me over, but I went kicking and screaming."
Downton Abbey,"Elegant, occasionally adorable and at times quite emotional, series creator Julian Fellowes still knows how to pluck the right strings -- upstairs and downstairs -- to play a symphony with his sprawling cast."
Downton Abbey,"""A New Era"" is both more focused and more substantial than the first film, which makes it especially satisfying to step back into its cozily rose-colored, slightly ridiculous take on early 20th century England."
Downton Abbey,This film represents an excellent job of fan service on several levels.
Downton Abbey,"A New Era offers the kind of comfortable, comforting experience that Downton Abbey aficionados have been awaiting..."
Downton Abbey,I’m as shocked as anyone by just how much I adored Downtown Abbey: A New Era.
Downton Abbey,"“A New Era” is a misnomer of a title -- not much has changed, which actually may be the best gift to “Downton” fans. After a tough couple of years, you could do worse than this."
Downton Abbey,"If you’re hoping for happy endings for almost every character and a nod to the themes of changing times (like the jazz number and the movie production) and eroding class distinctions, then you will be as delighted as I was."
Downton Abbey,"What was once a sophisticated, edgy, witty, sexy drama series has become “The Love Boat” Season 10. Though these wax figures’ love is even less exciting and neeeeew than that old show."
Downton Abbey,Downton Abbey: A New Era was as satisfying a filmgoing experience as I can remember.
Downton Abbey,"One may rightfully ask whether the world needs another Downton Abbey movie, to which I would respond in my best Violet Crawley “What is a weekend?” voice: “What is need?”"
Downton Abbey,"Will you enjoy a A New Era even if you’ve never seen a single second of Downton Abbey? As the Crawleys themselves might say, “I’d rather think so.” But this is a movie for the fans."
Downton Abbey,"The choppy waters of modernity are materializing on the horizon. To stay afloat, this amiable sequel decides to ever so slightly democratize itself."
Downton Abbey,"Die-hard Downton fans aren’t going to grumble at the chance to spend more time with well-loved characters, and there are plenty of bright spots along the way."
Downton Abbey,"In the end, ""A New Era"" is a lot like each of the six seasons of ""Downton Abbey"" on PBS: Things start out shakily but end on a lovely, graceful note."
Downton Abbey,"Affords its share of passing pleasures. And not just of the usual luxury-porn variety, although those who watch “Downton Abbey” for the pearls, frocks and waistcoats, the posh furnishings and elegant dinners will hardly be disappointed."
Downton Abbey,"The film’s sentimental plot may be thinner than a sheet of tissue paper, but it was still moving to this stalwart viewer."
Downton Abbey,"There is catharsis to be had for long-time “Downton” devotees — and, really, if you aren’t already invested why would you see this movie?"
Downton Abbey,The hit British series returns to the big screen with another elegantly entertaining episode.
Downton Abbey,All sequels should be so — there’s no other word for it — considerate of their audience.
Downton Abbey,"As a standalone film, the fatigued period drama goes in one era and out the other with little to add."
Downton Abbey,Downton Abbey: A New Era goes down as easy as a Nice sunset.
Downton Abbey,"It’s a cozy comfort to return to this airy, nearly consequence-free world. As we arrive at A New Era, the story has already had so many endings that all of the characters seem to be reeling in a kind of loopy afterlife."
Downton Abbey,"There are some amusing one-liners throughout the film, visually it’s beautiful and it mostly has a happy ending."
Downton Abbey,"A chaste, mannered soap opera that feels like a relic of another time in more ways than one, but perhaps, that’s the entire appeal."
Downton Abbey,"A charming and soapy new chapter filled with enjoyably dry humor (mostly courtesy of the fantastic Maggie Smith), some heartbreak, a dash of mystery and a history lesson from old-school Hollywood."
Downton Abbey,"Whereas the previous film is nothing more than a superfluous comedy of manners brought about by a royal visit to the estate, the sequel finds Fellowes revisiting some of his series’ most enduring tropes."
Downton Abbey,"Just what the doctor ordered, bringing with it a warm sense of kindness and optimism."
Downton Abbey,"""A New Era"" isn't going to win over any new converts, but it will give existing obsessives of the series that feeling of warmth that the show gave them over its six-season run."
Downton Abbey,"‘A New Era’ gives each of these characters their due, remaining true to what fans love with its signature charm and comfort while still managing to surprise."
Downton Abbey,"As usual, the production design and costumes are museum-perfect, and even as things remain as complicated ever with the Crawleys et al., the film itself is the definition of a simple pleasure."
Downton Abbey,"The acting is splendid. Fellowes’ dialogue may not be subtle, but the actors are so familiar and at home in these roles that they make up for whatever is lacking."
Downton Abbey,A New Era’s acknowledgement that some things must die for new things to be born works to justify the film’s title by quietly linking its themes of entitlement and survival.
Downton Abbey,"The great allure of the Downton sequel is, once again, Maggie Smith... When, watching the film-within-the-film being made, she says “I’d rather earn my living down a mine”, you can only believe her. Such a star."
Downton Abbey,“All smile!” a photographer orders a group early in the film. You can hear the writer in that as well.
Downton Abbey,"The title of the second Downton Abbey movie promises a new era, but in fact this is a reheated serving of reassuringly familiar comfort food for fans of the series."
Downton Abbey,"This is filmmaking by numbers, but you can’t really complain. It’s arranged around the need to give all the main cast members their moment in the sun, whether it’s shining on the Mediterranean or the lush lawns and fields of Downton."
Downton Abbey,It is afflicted by a ton of exposition and some truly terrible lines. And it’s as highly predictable as it is highly familiar.
Downton Abbey,"Soapy it may be, but for those who’ve poshed it up with the Crawleys since the very start, this is an affectionate, escapist hug of a movie — like being wrapped in a doily."
Downton Abbey,Claustrophobic Marks-and-Spencer’s mildness quickly decomposes in memory.
Downton Abbey,"Its an unlikely but pleasant fantasy where good things just happen, the rich are benevolent and the poor all muddle along nicely."
Downton Abbey,"Downton Abbey: A New Era delivers exactly the same as every other incarnation of Downton Abbey, with a tearjerker ending for the core fanbase."
Downton Abbey,"When Fellowes slips in a reference to David Copperfield, it’s hard not to cringe. Dickens, Shakespeare, Wilde and Christie. Fellowes loves these writers, but -- unlike them -- his success doesn’t seem built to last."
Downton Abbey,"A New Era is strictly high-toned formula, from its God's-eye opening over spire-tipped turrets and green-velvet lawns to its soft-focus finish, but it feels like home."
Downton Abbey,"Is there still life in these bones, basically? The answer is yes, with caveats, many of them on display in Simon Curtis’ fluffy, frothy, occasionally quite moving, and often scattered-feeling followup, Downton Abbey: A New Era."
Downton Abbey,"More poignant moments tug at the heartstrings effectively, and are swiftly followed by smiles: This is a film designed to cheer people up."
Downton Abbey,The humour never evolves far beyond chortling about the French or treating the working class as a quaint sideshow attraction.
Downton Abbey,Often the film feels like a parody of itself...but it works
Downton Abbey,"Everyone, upstairs and downstairs, is merrily bourgeois together content to hug and kiss as if parlourmaids cleaned the dishes as a favour without any money changing hands."
Downton Abbey,There is something diverting about the deadly serious melodrama and bizarre glassy-eyed pathos that Downton 2 is serving up.
Downton Abbey,"Fellowes gives us an affectionate group hug, which is effectively what these encore visits amount to."
Downton Abbey,"Gosford Park it isn’t – but nor is it just TV writ large. Unlike the previous Downton film, this one feels cinematically worthwhile."
Downton Abbey,"Despite the promise of sweeping change in its title, Downton Abbey: A New Era is very much more of the same, which will be just fine with devotees of the long-running PBS hit."
Downton Abbey,"Now it touches on Disney-ish fantasy, where the drama isn’t even remotely dramatic."
Downton Abbey,"Written once again by Julian Fellowes, the film opens with a wedding and goes on to feature a death, a birth and a proposal (not in that order), and yet it leaves the impression that nothing whatsoever has happened."
Mobile Homes,"Under [de Fontenay's] microscope, [the characters] don't feel like real people lost so much as white American trash test subjects."
Mobile Homes,If only Vladimir de Fontenay's film could match the sheer expressive power of its actress.
Mobile Homes,"But while the story's a little shaky, Poots is outstanding; and de Fontenay has a terrific eye for the details of a drifter's life."
Mobile Homes,"There is so much on the line, so many dire circumstances that the characters' peril grips your attention. Keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, from beginning to end, is the mark of a well-crafted and executed film."
Mobile Homes,"Driving a van and living in motels, these are low-level grifters whose pathetic American Dream is to become trailer trash. Their roads lead to nowhere. So too does this rootless, desolation-adoring film."
Mobile Homes,A squalid and deeply condescending portrait of what this outsider imagines lower-class Americana to be.
Mobile Homes,"Boasts a few pleasingly poetic flourishes, but it suffers from some common first-time director flaws, notably a listless narrative, thinly developed characters and a relentlessly somber mood."
Billionaire Boys Club,"Cox has managed to recruit great actors only to elicit bafflingly melodramatic and stilted work. Emma Roberts, as an aspiring artist and the only female character with more than a couple speaking lines, is particularly wasted."
Billionaire Boys Club,It should... be avoided like a contagious rash.
Billionaire Boys Club,"Cox finds himself doing a poor imitation of Martin Scorsese, channeling the manic hedonism of both ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" minus the seductive magnetism of either film's central performance."
Billionaire Boys Club,"It's a derivative bore, all popped collars, douchey bros and hand-me-down psychology, that gets its characters up to their necks in borrowed money just long enough to have it really hurt when the accounts run dry."
Billionaire Boys Club,The movie delves into a weak exploration of Hunt's private life.
Billionaire Boys Club,"As Hunt's life unravels, so does the movie, though the story maintains a certain baseline of interest just by virtue of being sordid."
Bad Lucky Goat,The first feature from Colombian director Samir Oliveros is one of the best debuts of the year -- and a great indication of things to come.
Bad Lucky Goat,"... an affably quirky debut feature by Bogota, Colombia-based Samir Oliveros."
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,"It's a gorgeous-looking, sensitively edited film to be sure, but never finds a dramatic foothold, no matter how many manic arguments and drug overdoses it throws our way."
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,What's the point of white privilege if it doesn't protect you from disaster and despair?
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,The directors get some melancholic atmosphere out of their visuals but don't have the scene sense to build their actors' committed performances into compelling through-lines of seaside personality disintegration.
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,It demonstrates a remarkable sense of atmosphere and place.
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,"This is pretty standard stuff, and it's not always rendered too convincingly."
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,"The Malloys' filmmaking never rises to the level of the actors' nuanced performances. The actors are energized, but the camera enervates."
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,"Garner erupts and expectorates with winning zeal, swatting tennis balls at the mistress and lambasting the very idea of Palos Verdes beauty regimens."
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,The unvaried register of the filmmaking leads the narrative to feel aimless and dramatically inert.
The Tribes of Palos Verdes,"The sibling helmers know the terrain: They're Los Angeles natives with surfing docs to their credit, and they convincingly make a teen girl's awakening inseparable from her mastery of a board."
Reinventing Marvin,"Fontaine's screenplay has astute things to say about authenticity and artifice, while Oldfield's biggest achievement may be holding his own opposite the mighty Isabelle Huppert, who has a super-cameo as herself."
Reinventing Marvin,"Messily structured, self-conscious and preposterous, buried within its own inelegant framing device."
Reinventing Marvin,"For anyone who's read Edouard Louis's 2014 novel The End of Eddy, a gut-wrenching account of growing up poor and gay in rural France, Reinventing Marvin will feel like a botched job."
Reinventing Marvin,"Best by a mile are newcomer Jules Porier as the young Marvin, a pale boy with gamin grace, and Grgory Gadebois as his father, a phlegmy walrus of a man forever exposing expanses of flesh in sleeveless denim and distended briefs."
Reinventing Marvin,"It's all a bit overlong and over-the-top, although the lead turn from rising star Finnegan Oldfield (Nocturama) is almost enough to make it work."
Reinventing Marvin,"[An] unsteady, overlong but rewardingly compassionate character study ..."
Porto,The actors lack chemistry; their romantic connection feels like lust amplified by loneliness.
Porto,"It's a typical example of the kind of empty, lunk-headed movies that are made these days by directors who think it's interesting to watch two people walking down the street carrying boxes."
Porto,This whole thing is so brazenly a male fantasy...
Porto,The screenplay ... falls too easily into clichs about rough men and troubled women to ever achieve something truly resonant about the highs and fallouts of chance encounters.
Porto,[A] quietly bombastic and emotionally oblivious romantic drama.
Porto,Less than meets the eye and ear.
Porto,"Often ravishing aesthetics and stylistic quirks act as soft restraints, keeping us watching despite a near-total absence of story and a thinly disguised attitude of male entitlement."
Porto,"Jake's section is nearly twice as long as Mati's despite being about half as interesting, which also mutes Lucas' otherwise strong performance."
Porto,"The film is not a perfect undertaking, but it confirms Yelchin's unique talent and underscores the sadness of his untimely death."
Porto,"This is a remarkable and tender romance curtailed, broken by character flaws, yet one that leaves the audience still in love with the protagonists, in all their fractured ways."
Porto,"Gabe Klinger's influences feel secondary to the film's larger grappling with a timeless emotional enigma: namely, infatuation, and the question of how such a mighty force can also be so fleeting."
Porto,"In artfully deconstructing a one-night stand with one wistful eye on what was and another on what could have been, Gabe Klinger's first narrative feature winds up feeling appropriately elegiac in a multitude of ways."
Porto,"Struggles to convey its passions, despite considerable effort from its two leads, an intuitive soundtrack and handsome photography."
The Party’s Just Beginning,"A strikingly odd and original debut that is admirable for taking the triple-threat of suicide, depression and addiction in its nonchalant stride, although the confusing presentation of separate timelines mutes the overall impact."
The Party’s Just Beginning,"I can't help thinking Gillan's superpower as a writer and performer might actually be comedy. Still, always a compelling screen presence, she's now a film-maker to watch."
The Party’s Just Beginning,"Gillan plays her messy, mournful role with unfussy integrity."
The Party’s Just Beginning,The movie's sneaky theme is anonymity as our 21st century cure-all for the burden of knowing too much and yet wondering if we really know anyone at all.
The Party’s Just Beginning,"There's a real power to the filmmaking here; Gillan is, clearly, a force to be reckoned with."
The Party’s Just Beginning,The movie is wispy and meandering; it doesn't gather power as it goes along.
The Party’s Just Beginning,"Gillan's film weaves together both the past and the present, folding situations into each other with an ease that brushes past any initial audience confusion."
Edward II,Jarman's sparely elegant but urgently brazen recasting of Marlowe's tragedy seizes the theme of the historic (and artistic) vilification of homosexuality.
Edward II,
The Texture of Falling,"""The texture of falling"" is a phrase that sounds cool but means nothing, and that's a good description of this film as well."
The Texture of Falling,"The Texture of Falling is ultimately as beguiling as it is frustrating, with curiosity and a fascination for Allred's visual style compensating for a storyline the proves difficult to navigate."
The Texture of Falling,Allred's fractured storytelling seems intended to make the movie a sort of puzzle that comes together at the end (spoiler alert: it so doesn't).

"Distant Voices, Still Lives…","A work of empowerment and empathy, a celebration of Fox’s life as an actor and philanthropist."
"Distant Voices, Still Lives…",Its poignancy and humor is amplified by its canny decision to let Fox tell his own tale.
"Distant Voices, Still Lives…","Guggenheim and his subject also want to show what it’s like to be Michael J. Fox right now, and that’s really where this documentary... turns into something else entirely -- something beyond praise or tragedy."
"Distant Voices, Still Lives…",There’s undeniable emotional power coursing through every frame [of Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie].
"Distant Voices, Still Lives…","Through “Still,” Fox lets audiences see him as he is now. He’s smaller than many realize, and that’s another source of self-deprecating humor. But allowing his disability to be shown is a kind of strength."
"Distant Voices, Still Lives…","Fox is nothing if not a likable figure, and he and Guggenheim have crafted a likable film about both his suffering and resilience without turning him into a martyr."
"Distant Voices, Still Lives…",Admirable and intimate...
Postcards From London,It's worth it for Harris Dickinson and you won't have seen anything like it.
Postcards From London,"Here is a diverting, self-conscious fantasy sketch of gay life and gay sensibility composed of what the film-maker imagines or remembers of bygone Soho's lost bohemianism."
Postcards From London,"Despite a skillful use of color, lighting, framing and music, the movie's artificiality might have played in a short film but becomes tedious and pretentious when stretched to 90 minutes."
Postcards From London,"Aside from bad filmmaking, I don't know what any of this means."
Postcards From London,"McLean's nostalgia for the Soho of Francis Bacon, Freud, and Jarman (all of them clear influences on his own work) is touchingly wistful about the ravages of time, and he's serious about probing the mixed blessings of sex, art, beauty and authenticity."
Postcards From London,[It] may not make for a particularly involving narrative experience. But it sure is nice to look at.
Postcards From London,"Although Postcards from London ultimately doesn't quite live up to its considerable ambitions, it offers plenty of arresting moments along the way."
Postcards From London,"But self-consciousness is not the same thing as self-awareness. And in a movie overflowing with the former and lacking in the latter, Jim primarily becomes an inadvertent symbol of narcissism and superficiality."
Postcards From London,"Pretty but hollow, ""Postcards From London"" isn't quite clever enough to get away with being this deeply frivolous."

The Nun,"Despite the scares being a tad repetitive, they are made and photographed well, meanwhile, the special effects are first-rate. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Nun,"The Catholic horror wheel isn’t reinvented, but the jump scares are so nonstop and occasionally clever that I was left wondering: is this the most fun I’ve had at the movies all summer?"
The Nun,"I actually like this better than the first Nun, in terms of its atmosphere, in terms of its mood; and then eventually 4:59 there is some emotional groundedness that the first one lacks."
The Nun,"I was never bored by this sequel, and even if I always knew how things were going to work themselves out, my eyes nonetheless remained glued to the screen."
The Nun,The Michael Chaves-directed sequel is a messy but entertaining one that finally seems to justify this sub-franchise’s existence.
The Nun,"This entry absolves the spin-offs' worst sins; it's sometimes sillier than it is scary, but it's never as boring as either its direct predecessor or Chaves's The Curse of La Llorona."
The Nun,"A slick if familiar addition to the very fertile “Conjuring” universe that, by deftly expanding on the 2018 hit, appears destined to become another cinematic habit."
The Nun,an utter snooze.
The Nun,"There's an overall lack of thoughtfulness in “The Nun II” regarding scares, and Chaves is vehemently loyal to oversaturated tropes."
The Nun,"One could argue that there’s way too much screaming going on — I mean, after you’ve seen the demon four or five times, is it really that shocking? — but that’s a minor complaint."
The Nun,Here’s another helping of lavish pseudo-religious hokum...
The Nun,"Scene after scene builds fear and tension, and then a monster appears, and then … not much else, in most cases."
The Nun,A movie that seems destined to pound a nail into this franchise’s undead coffin.
The Nun,"Its many inane moments sound entertaining when you list them all on one page, but they’re so spread out through this movie that the entertainment is usually quite scarce."
The Nun,The Nun II dials up the fear factor as it takes the “more is more” approach to everything from set pieces to mythology. It makes for a livelier entry that stumbles in its excess and can't capture what made Valak so scary in the first place.
The Nun,“The Nun II” has some interesting ideas and some thrilling sequences...
The Nun,"Notching up his third entry in what I suppose we’re meant to call the CCU, Michael Chaves looks alive, as often, with the set pieces..."
The Nun,An entertaining entry in the Conjuring canon that proves there are still whimpers to be wrung from what’s under that wimple.
The Nun,"In some respects an improvement on its predecessor, in others not, this is finally one more good-enough if unmemorable entry sure to extend the series’ life in lucrative fashion."
The Nun,"If you can stomach roughly an hour of a scary nun with a subpar skincare routine popping her head out of doorways and chasing French people down corridors, there’s a gleefully demented finale waiting for you..."
The Nun,"Call it ""Demon movies gonna demon movie."" And so ""The Nun II"" does its thing, efficiently and with lots of jump scares, as Irene and the Defiler go toe to toe."
The Nun,"When even the makers of the Nun films are losing interest in malevolent nuns, it’s time to start looking for new ways to be scary."
The Nun,"“Is this just a big dead end?” asks Debra. You said it, Sister."
The Nun,"If The Conjuring Universe is a horror force you want to believe in again, then “The Nun II” will bring you back to the faith."
The Nun,"A rock-solid new addition to the Conjuring Universe, one that embraces the existing series style and then pushes it further via hugely creative scare scenes and some exciting new additions to franchise lore."

Dark River,The kind of movie that mistakes rumbling storm clouds and restless sheep for plot development.
Dark River,"Even in the swelling canon of British rural miserabilism, this unrelentingly intense psychodrama burrows beneath the skin."
Dark River,"""Dark River"" is a forgettable title for a movie that's anything but."
Dark River,"It's a beautifully crafted, moodily evocative film that's missing just one spark of true inspiration."
Dark River,"While Clio Barnard so masterfully limns her protagonist's tortured soul, the brother-sister drama at the center of the film remains frustratingly hazy."
Dark River,"Dark fare indeed, and you won't shake it off easily."
Dark River,An impressive murder ballad.
Dark River,"On the whole, despite not being able to tick all the boxes, Dark River still manages to be intriguing, deeply engaging and fantastically well acted."
Dark River,Sensitively explores the way a traumatic memory can seep through a life in the same way that poisoned groundwater can taint a piece of land.
Dark River,"Barnard once again evokes a grubby, gothic landscape that'll get right under your fingernails. It'll stay there for weeks."
Dark River,"There are occasional fine, touching moments but, for the most part, it's as heavy-going as it is heavy-handed and some aspects are plain odd."
Dark River,"Despite a sadly muddled finale, this is a superior drama, led by Wilson's steely and focused performance and cleanly, concisely directed by Barnard."
Dark River,A muddy misstep from an otherwise notable talent.
Dark River,This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn't but Dark River still has quite an impact.
Dark River,Everything feels generic; from the grey-clouded gorgeous countryside (belying Barnard's stated aversion to putting nature's beauty on a pedestal) to the characters summed up by their tendentiously themed pasts.
Dark River,The power of Barnard's visionary style shines through regardless but this will go down in the annals of film history as one of her lesser works.
Dark River,"This is a wilder, bigger thing than just another farmyard sink drama. There may be little you haven't seen elsewhere, but there's no denying the skill here."
Dark River,"Wilson and Stanley are both excellent performers and they are the mainstays of a valuable piece of work, but I felt the ending was contrived and a bit grandiloquent."
Dark River,This is a kitchen-sink drag.
Dark River,"A moving, North of England-set portrait of marginalized working-class cultures and the resilience of damaged children."
Dark River,The rugged emotional territory (and the Yorkshire accents) prove heavy-going in an uncompromising film that elicits a lot more admiration than enjoyment.
Dark River,"Once again, Barnard delivers an intimate take on a difficult subject, raising anticipation for her future work should she decide to scale up."
Dark River,"There's scarcely room here for improvement at the level of craft or performance; in particular, it's gratifying to see leading lady Ruth Wilson headlining a big-screen vehicle worthy of her flinty brilliance."
Summer of 67,You'll absolutely fall in love with Sharonne Lanier's Ruby Mae.
Please Stand By,"Lewin can't quite transcend the inconsistencies and dwindling credibility of the concept or give the material a driving pulse, even with its race-to-the-deadline setup."
Please Stand By,"You can guess how most of its scenes will play before you even come to them, and it has a circumspect, sanitized quality, as if meant to be shown in group homes without causing undue upset."
Please Stand By,Touches the viewer with the subtle emotional wallop of a feather brushing against the heart.
Please Stand By,A sensitive character study whose story beats are a little bit overly familiar.
Please Stand By,"Lewin ... posits this as a whimsical road comedy, but I couldn't help questioning both the logic and the consistency."
Please Stand By,"Please Stand By deflates into a perfectly watchable but soft parable in which a can-do young American loses a battle, only to win the war of growing up, while the adults in the room confront their own unhelpful rigidities."
Please Stand By,"It's a pleasant journey to take with Fanning, and one that should be required viewing for anyone who has ever ridiculed the labor of love that is writing fan fiction."
Please Stand By,Fanning [is] a performer who never chomps down on a role-she plays Wendy as a person and not a condition.
Please Stand By,This timorous tale sidesteps uncomfortable realities in favor of soothing whimsy and preordained uplift.
Please Stand By,It's hard to be persuasive ... when your protagonist comes across as a collection of quirky tics rather than a credible human being.
The Samuel Project,"Like a history lesson delivered by an excited and affable - if inexperienced - teacher, ""The Samuel Project"" means well and will likely move audiences, despite its own undermining efforts."

Head Full of Honey,"Exaggerated, infuriating, and about as funny as a root canal without anesthesia."
Head Full of Honey,"A raucous, wildly implausible, overlong jumble saddled by a host of misguided creative instincts. It's a potentially warm and delicate story that required a scalpel, but saw the blunt end of a sledgehammer instead."
Head Full of Honey,"To go with its bizarre plotting and shrill performances, the film seems to have been edited in a Cuisinart. But those are the least of its crimes."
Like Me,This colourful Israeli drama centres on a messy but self-assured teen trying to plot a course in life. Filmmaker Eyal Kantor finds realistic rhythms in the interaction between characters who have quite a lot on their minds.
Novitiate,"Director Margaret Betts offers a beautifully-shot, thoughtful drama, filled with some fine acting, particularly by Melissa Leo."
Novitiate,"Maggie Betts' first feature is remarkably assured, bringing us into a hidden world filled with complex characters struggling with issues of faith, identity, and change."
Novitiate,Novitiate is a beguiling movie that requires a thorough examination of your own conscience and connection to religion.
Novitiate,"Most films, especially mainstream ones, are about the forces that whirl around characters. ""Novitiate"" grapples with what's going on inside them."
Novitiate,"Leo owns the film. Even when she's not onscreen, the character's heavy, leaden love for her God by all means necessary hovers, wraithlike, over novitiates and viewers alike."
Novitiate,"In Leo, it presents a remarkable portrait of a complex woman struggling with forces beyond her control."
Novitiate,"[Reverend Mother Leo's] countenance alternates between a stony smile and a twisted snarl, except for the moments when the changes wrought by Vatican II threaten to loosen her iron grip over her young charges. Then she simply goes to pieces."
Novitiate,"There are times when Novitiate tests the viewer's endurance - it's a beautifully shot movie, but it runs more than two hours, and lingering compositions of silent nuns and novitiates start to feel unsupported by the story."
Novitiate,"The film raises interesting questions, but the answers remain elusive, and whether that makes for a compelling cinematic experience is entirely in the eye of the beholder."
Novitiate,It's well worth seeing ... not least for the ways it conveys the profound intensity of religious devotion and the costs such devotion can exact.
Novitiate,It says everything about the effective subtlety of Betts' writing and of the performances it inspired that much of what we know of the characters is rarely if ever stated.
Novitiate,Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Novitiate is the even-handedness with which it treats religion in general and 1960s era Catholicism in particular.
Novitiate,Leo's impassioned acting makes a supporting role seem like a leading one.
Novitiate,Writer-director Maggie Betts balances the naturalistic exchanges of her sympathetic young cast with bravura set pieces for the seasoned actors.
Novitiate,"... but there is a coyness about ""Novitiate"" that makes a viewer not care so very much."
Novitiate,"Betts has put together a talented acting ensemble, and the performances are, for the most part, uniformly good and subtle, particularly among the actresses who play the young novices."
Novitiate,You can call Novitiate divinely inspired and mean it.
Novitiate,"A stirring, soulful convent drama from first-time director Maggie Betts features Melissa Leo in an Oscar-worthy performance as Mother Superior. The film is a potent provocation shot through with grit and grace."
Novitiate,"Novitiate is an intriguing if somewhat opaque movie, a feverish testament to the long reach and hard limits of faith."
Novitiate,"Betts has succeeded in capturing a watershed moment in the life of the Catholic Church - a push to adapt that is, in important ways, at odds with its very origins."
Novitiate,"Novitiate finds room for all these viewpoints; appreciating the dedication it takes to live such a life while also questioning its suppression of individuality, emotion. This willingness to embrace such complexity is a bit of a miracle in itself."
Novitiate,Novitiate is a solid and nuanced drama that enables us to experience a world most of us know little or nothing about.
Novitiate,Betts aims divinely high and succeeds in both understanding and respectfully critiquing organized religion.
Novitiate,"In a time of reflexive irony and glib sophistication, Ms. Betts has made a lovely film about love of God-about marriage to God-and given it a political dimension as well as a dominant character of fierce complexity."
Novitiate,"When Novitiate retains its focus, it ventures towards some interesting answers."
Novitiate,"Questions of faith may sound dry but they often make for intensely dramatic, even pulse-pounding cinema. ""Novitiate"" is the latest case in point."
Novitiate,"Ms. Betts refrains from easy, uplifting answers and facile condemnations of organized religion."
Novitiate,"Betts appears to have started out with a rather mundane idea and then stumbled, over the course of her research, onto something much more fruitful. The result is as intriguing and frustrating as that suggests."
Novitiate,"The film's meditative and excessive sides never quite cohere, giving the impression of watching two distinct films that are jostling against each other, rather than united in a single story."
Novitiate,"Betts ... undercuts the characters' passion and transcendent devotion with audiovisual commonplaces, familiar acting styles, and a merely anecdotal narrative."
Novitiate,"In a way, 'Novitiate' is like a companion piece to 'Silence,' pondering some of the same big questions of faith and affirmation. It's not quite the film 'Silence' is, but few movies are."
Novitiate,Filmmaker Maggie Betts guides the drama with a measured intensity. Her directing talent is sharp as a tack.
Novitiate,"Narratively speaking, there are no climaxes, no anti-climaxes, just a methodical commitment to establishing the context of one big question: can a woman live without physical love?"
Novitiate,"Novitiate doesn't tell a straightforward story of love and sacrifice, of faith and its crises. [Margaret] Betts's film is ritualistic and enthralling, with a complex feminism woven into its cloth, and it's something of a blessing."
Novitiate,"Strikingly ambitious, even when it can be as formal as a church service."
Novitiate,"There's a lot of great filmmaking in Novitiate, but there's also quite a bit still missing."
Novitiate,"Novitiate captures something many religious people can understand: the idea that beating oneself (both figuratively and, sometimes, literally) as an act of devotion will make God love us more than he loves other people."
Novitiate,Shining testament to the power of belief.
Novitiate,"Mesmerizes as it probes a uniquely female-dominated milieu where passions - both religious, sexual and a combination of the two - run hot under those starched, lily-white coifs and black habits."
Novitiate,"It's thought-provoking, occasionally melodramatic fare that should definitely garner some award nominations for Leo, who could put the fear of God into anybody."
Novitiate,The tension Leo can generate simply by entering a room is extraordinary; the folds in her wimple look like extra neck tendons.
Novitiate,"A piercing, immersive, and superbly played convent drama in which the suppression of speech is witnessed at both an individual and institutional level."
Novitiate,"What's most interesting is the way Betts taps into the complicated semi-romantic dynamic between the nuns and Jesus, the man to whom they have dedicated themselves."

The Last Movie Star,The Last Movie Star strikes a note of banality in its first sequence from which it rarely deviates.
The Last Movie Star,"In a threadbare movie that doesn't deserve him, Burt Reynolds-playing a fictional version of himself- reminds us what a great actor he can be."
The Last Movie Star,"As a commentary on Reynolds' career trajectory, The Last Movie Star is hit-or-miss. What is undeniable, though, is the space Rifkin has created where Reynolds can do what Reynolds does best."
The Last Movie Star,Another example of Reynolds accepting the wrong invitation and winding up in a role unworthy of his stature.
The Last Movie Star,"Thanks to its star's all-in commitment, the overtly maudlin film works better than it should ..."
The Last Movie Star,"The director Adam Rifkin wrote this showcase for Mr. Reynolds, who, like Vic, was a college football player. ""The Last Movie Star"" effectively allows the ever-assured actor to score a touchdown on an empty field."
The Last Movie Star,Meandering and maudlin and drearily predictable ...
The Last Movie Star,"Dog Years is a collection of old-fogey clichés, with a narrative that mixes a career retrospective with a road trip."
The Last Movie Star,"Despite a few good moments, this well-intentioned seriocomedy mostly wobbles between crude yocks, lame generation-gap humor and sentimental cliche."
The Last Movie Star,"A movie that strives for elegiac depth, but achieves only snoozy shallowness."
The Last Movie Star,Whatever pathos is generated comes from Reynolds's commitment to all the self-exploitation. His inimitable charm is still there beneath all the corporeal decrepitude on which Rifkin and company shamelessly linger.
Thelma,"Thelma is visually and sonically impressive, with images that linger in the mind long after the film has ended, but a superfluous narrative detour strips the film of any uniqueness."
Thelma,"The scary moments are there, but they take patience. And then they take you by surprise."
Thelma,"""Thelma"" treads the line between the psychological and supernatural, gracefully at first, and then with increasing abandon."
Thelma,"Thelma is a beautiful and heartbreaking film that is an impressive addition to the coming-of-age story. A lady bird, indeed."
Thelma,"As a hushed, haunting portrait of a young woman reconciling daughterly duty and her own incipient power, ""Thelma"" feels like a stylish, timely allegory for the present moment."
Thelma,"It's chilly in Oslo, and in this movie; the better to sneak up on you quietly, like an unexpected shiver."
Thelma,"Trier has found a new way to depict and talk about these emotions and experiences that most human beings know and can never really get over. His way is cold, deadpan, extreme, and very Scandinavian, and it's effective."
Thelma,"The supernatural Thelma is the coming-of-age experience in a nutshell: It's all about finding out who you are, with all the invigorating uncertainty and ambiguity that entails."
Thelma,"""Thelma"" is tense, thoughtful and beautifully composed ..."
Thelma,"If you've ever held something deep down that nearly ruined you, then you'll relate to Thelma's plight."
Thelma,"While the film doesn't entirely deliver on its start, the overall mood remains pricked by a similar sense of doom and shivering unease."
Thelma,The ending is a little shy of perfection but Thelma remains a tantalizing gem.
Thelma,"Enriching Thelma's chaos is the director's refusal to outright censure any of his characters, no matter the sometimes awful choices they make."
Thelma,"""Thelma"" exerts a grip of its own, not least when it presses against other genres, leaching details from both science fiction and horror."
Thelma,The spell it casts transcends the silly plotting. It puts you in a zone all its own.
Thelma,The level to which Trier is willing to lay Thelma emotionally bare is just as heartbreaking as it is harrowing
Thelma,"The dread in Thelma is not so easy to pin down, coming as it does almost totally through Trier's choice of visuals."
Thelma,There's too much undeniably impressive filmmaking to dismiss Thelma; there's too much uncertain storytelling to actually recommend it.
Thelma,"Trier is a ingenious filmmaker, and he makes Thelma visually compelling even when the story lazily turns to the usual scare-flick tropes."
Thelma,"Mostly, and most satisfyingly, it plays with the female Gothic, those unnerving tales - churning with desires and dread, and quivering with anxiety and suspicion - in which women are at once the victims and agents of change."
Thelma,"With its gray skies, moody ambience and ominous orchestral score, ""Thelma"" fits the cliché about Scandinavian entertainment being dark as hell - in the best way. It's also gorgeous."
Thelma,"Thelma doesn't play with pig's blood and jump scares; its dreamlike dread is subtler and stranger, and much harder to shake."
Thelma,"Thelma is an example of a wonderful type of fantasy/sci-fi film, the sort of movie that both clearly deals in allegory and is still effective on its surface."
Thelma,"Like an emo Carrie, it probes the profound underlying sadness beneath tales of possession. It makes vivid the protagonist's loneliness and despair."
Thelma,"An accomplished coming-of-age psychodrama-cum-thriller with echoes of Carrie, Thelma unsettles and frightens."
Thelma,The teenage traps of repression and loneliness are explored here through genre - the spooky-movie sweet spot where body horror meets erotic thriller.
Thelma,"Both Eili Harboe and Kaya Wilkins maintain an enigmatic, wide-eyed blankness as the possibly star-crossed lovers. Mesmerising and thrilling."
Thelma,"Surprisingly tender, Thelma proves itself a modern take on the supernatural film, with a short burst of synth music at the end to remind us of its forebears."
Thelma,The film becomes an open-ended saga about rejecting family to pursue your own independent path ...
Thelma,"Scandi-noir takes a supernatural turn in Joachim Trier's creepy, erotic thriller."
Thelma,Thelma is an intriguing but unwieldy mix between European art-house drama and supernatural horror.
Thelma,There is a scariness and sexiness to go with its cool understatements and opaque mysteries
Thelma,Norwegian director Joachim Trier refuses to stick either his characters or the forces guiding them into neat boxes.
Thelma,"[Thelma] links supernatural horror to repressed memories, raging hormones, and fundamentalist zealotry, crafting a sexy and unsettling brain-teaser."
Thelma,"...Thelma's slow-burn coming of (r)age, presented all at once as a repressed young woman's psychotic fugue of fantasised empowerment, a provocative Second Coming and an unnerving supernatural horror."
Thelma,"With the beguiling and disturbing Thelma, Cannes-lauded filmmaker Joachim Trier adapts to supernatural-tinged horror with almost disturbing ease."
Thelma,Thelma's transition into a paranormal thriller doesn't complicate its initially potent character study.
Thelma,"A beautifully modulated thriller, and it comes with a message that feels valuable-it's not homosexuality that will bring about the devil but its repression."
Thelma,"Though billed as a thriller, Thelma is more slow-burn horror, a monster movie with a wounded but human heart at its core."
Thelma,"At times a tad too subtle, ""Thelma"" is nonetheless an unnervingly effective slow-burn, and those with the patience for Trier's patient accumulation of detail will find it pays off in unexpected ways."
Thelma,"Where it's going is fascinating enough yet without an undercurrent of the human life caught in this horror, Thelma feels too stark an exercise. The film leaves us with its ideas on a theoretical level rather than a gut-wrenching one."
Thelma,"... Thelma's story sticks to your bones like a shiver, and sinks deeper for days after the credits have rolled."
Thelma,"Trier remains precisely attuned to emotional wavelengths; as a queer campus love story, of sorts, Thelma has the right temperament, thanks in part to the nakedly vulnerable performance the director coaxes from his lead."
Thelma,"A stylish, distinctively Scandinavian take on familiar horror themes."
Gabriel and the Mountain,"Barbosa tracks the feverish ups and downs of his friend's journey through his charming, maddening character."
Gabriel and the Mountain,Outstanding
Gabriel and the Mountain,"A perceptive and poetic hybrid of documentary and fiction. It both captures and gently critiques Gabriel's free-spirited, adventurous sensibility."
Gabriel and the Mountain,The film seems to think that the mere recognition of Gabriel as a narcissist sufficiently complicates the character's sense of entitlement.
Gabriel and the Mountain,"Director Barbosa's love letter to his late friend is emotionally satisfying and cinematically splendid, with social commentary shoe-horned in for better or worse."
Gabriel and the Mountain,"Watching ""Gabriel and the Mountain"" is like getting to know all sides of a friend's character: You may discover more arrogance than expected, but the elements you always liked are reinforced."
Gabriel and the Mountain,"What kind of commercial market there is out there for this kind of fare beyond Brazil, where Buchmann's story is quite well-known, remains a question mark."
Anything,"It's Lynch who carries the movie, delivering a quiet, contemplative performance as a man trying to rebuild his life after losing everything."
Anything,An implausible romantic drama with good intentions that can't overcome its silly contrivances.
Anything,"McNeil plays it way too safe. Trying to have it both ways, he satisfies no one."
Anything,"As an actor, Lynch exudes authenticity, whether the role calls for sensitivity or terror. If nothing else, Anything affords this character actor a proper leading man's time in the spotlight, and that alone is enough reason to celebrate the film."
Anything,"It's sensitively written, humorously human, warmly acted, and admirably resistant to most of the obvious drag-queen cliches."
Anything,"Anything is one more casualty in Hollywood's long history of ransacking transgender stories, which it does under the guise of paying homage without paying coins to those it claims to represent"
Anything,"Writer-director Timothy McNeil...crafts a fairly moving tribute to the notion, as Lin-Manuel Miranda once put it, that ""love is love is love."""
Anything,"Even when I didn't believe ""Anything,"" I bought it. That's a testament to a lead actor whose performance rings emotionally true despite a good-hearted script that can seem a stretch."
Anything,The overall tone of Anything is that of tender magnanimity.
Anything,"A romance between a recent widower and a transgender woman that, at nearly every turn, operates in schematic fashion."
Anything,"A touching, tentative love story."
Loving Pablo,The film spends much too much time going over the same rise-and-fall material that has been a staple of many portrayals of Escobar himself and of most gangster films going back to the 1930's.
Loving Pablo,"""Tolerating Pablo"" might have better suited this unremarkable picture..."
Loving Pablo,"It's the cinematic equivalent of a vintage True Confessions article-the kind that would inspire a headline like ""My Sin Was Loving Him."""
Loving Pablo,Both actors gamely bring the full heft of their movie-star charisma.
Loving Pablo,"At its heart, this is a soap opera - a bloody one, sure, but still a soap with deliciously ripe dialogue and a diva at the center."
Loving Pablo,The film uncomfortably dwells in a murky middle ground where everything is overblown but meant to be taken at face value.
Loving Pablo,"Escobar is not without interest, sweep or colour, but bears signs of high-level, edit-suite indecision over what sort of movie it wants to be. It's an alluring product, inexactly cut."
Loving Pablo,"As if the figure of the king of drug trafficking wasn't a stereotype canonized by thrillers addicted to the dirty business, 'Loving Pablo' looks us right in the eyes and tells us it has just invented chicken soup.."
Loving Pablo,"This unintentionally hilarious take, on territory covered much more soberly and with far less reliance on prosthetic bellies in current Netflix hit ""Narcos,"" is so trashy it may even make you forget a few things you knew before."
Loving Pablo,"Like Escobar himself remaking the coca business in a bold, new and highly lucrative vision, Bardem and Cruz succeed by doing things their unique way."
Loving Pablo,"A brash but ultimately anonymous, sub-Scorsesean number from Spain's Fernando Leon de Aranoa, who has shown more distinctive form in Mondays in the Sun and internationally cast war story A Perfect Day."
Loving Pablo,"Like flipping through the pages of a pulpy best-seller, watching Loving Pablo has its moments of guilty pleasure but leaves an empty feeling when you reach the end."
Loving Pablo,"Long, loud and lurid, with a distinct whiff of week-old quesito colombiano."
Let There Be Light,The understated ending is effectively spine-chilling.
Let There Be Light,"Although some may be frustrated by former documentarian kop's observational rather than overtly critical view of his country's rising nationalism, the film raises important and provocative questions for which there are no easy answers."
Jet Trash,"It wears its influences on its tattooed sleeve, but this drug-fueled film is still an entertaining watch filled with bold style."
Jet Trash,"Jet Trash is affable, mildly distracting, gap-year porn masquerading as a proper grown-up thriller."
Jet Trash,Doubtless a nice holiday; shame about the movie.

Same Kind of Different as Me,"It's so sincere and admirable that it seems churlish to voice objections, but the fact remains that it isn't very good."
Same Kind of Different as Me,"""Same Kind of Different as Me"" is a strange, sincere and sometimes clumsy plea for old-fashioned Christian empathy."
Same Kind of Different as Me,"A film with a lovely, life-affirming, uplifting message - unfortunately delivered in such a heavy-handed, gooey-sweet manner that audiences will exit the theater in a near-diabetic coma."
Same Kind of Different as Me,"The very horrible complexities of racism and intolerance are simplified in ways inherent to many a Hollywood and faith-based film, all in the aim of glib uplift that may salve the individual spirit but solves absolutely nothing."
Same Kind of Different as Me,"A blandly good looking, no frills, reasonably competent and occasionally emotional Message Movie, one whose message favors a color-blind approach to race relations, one designed to work entirely in favor of the desires of white people."
Same Kind of Different as Me,"It can be hard to disagree with the heart and events of this true tale, except for when the movie reveals itself to be mighty self-congratulatory."
Soller’s Point,"Jim Belushi is superb in the small role of Keith's father, a man admired and respected by everyone but the one individual he loves more than all the others combined."
Soller’s Point,"The screenplay is naturalistic and the lead actor holds attention, but the film is too long and inconsequential to make much of a lasting impact as Keith meanders through his daily routines."
Soller’s Point,"With ""Sollers Point,"" [Porterfield has] added just enough narrative momentum to make that well-trod subset of crime sagas - the struggle to go straight - feel fresh again."
Soller’s Point,"What ""Sollers Point"" accomplishes is a singular balancing act, compensating for the mood of heavy discouragement with only the slenderest thread of hope."
Soller’s Point,Characters like this one can be infuriating. But Mr. Lombardi imbues Keith with an ordinary likability...
Soller’s Point,"The loose, seemingly improvisational performances bolster the film's unstudied realism and surface the hope and despair of the characters."
Soller’s Point,"The film is a moving and elusive blend of naturalism and melodrama, less a character study than an analysis of a community."
Soller’s Point,"Sketching Keith's inner conflicts and practical struggles with a graceful, mood-rich lyricism, Porterfield presses gently but painfully on some of the most inflamed and sensitive parts of American society."
Soller’s Point,Sollers Point is more bland and shapeless than any clearly empathetic project should be.
Soller’s Point,"Sollers Point is easy to admire, abstractly and on principle."
Soller’s Point,"You sense the futility in rooting for him, but you do all the same."
Soller’s Point,Matthew Porterfield's film ultimately conveys the limitations of freedom within towns like the one at its center.
Soller’s Point,"It gains little momentum, and the result feels a little pallid, for all its lived-in, worn-through sense of place."
Soller’s Point,"Working again in his native Baltimore, the writer-director maintains the documentary-style feel for place that has infused all his features."
God’s Own Country,"Writer-director Francis Lee creates a more credible rural milieu, anchored in the grubby details of raising livestock and the furious emotional repression of his male characters."
God’s Own Country,"Earnest, honest, accurate, and unrelenting, this is the true romance of the countryside, dung-splattered boots and all."
God’s Own Country,"Director/writer Francis Lee's electrifying feature debut is a working-class, fun-house mirror version of ""Call Me By Your Name's"" upper-class pretensions and is equally, if not more, rewarding because of it."
God’s Own Country,But O'Connor and Secareanu give such aching performances that their romance feels real.
God’s Own Country,"The film by writer-director Francis Lee, who grew up on a Yorkshire farm before turning to acting - and, later, filmmaking - is sweet, even if Johnny is not."
God’s Own Country,"This is not a movie about coming out and the collateral damage that ensues. It's a universal tale about giving yourself over to love, even when you seem hopelessly broken."
God’s Own Country,"This is human drama as shot through an unfiltered lens, God's Own Country a strong debut hinting at future greatness to come from the undeniably talented [writer/director Francis] Lee."
God’s Own Country,"Combining gritty realism with poignancy, the result is a film that is exceptionally moving."
God’s Own Country,This enigmatic little film says it all in razor-sharp closeups and minimal words
God’s Own Country,"In his debut feature, Lee has crafted a mature love story centered on an immature man facing the fear of even admitting that he needs love at all. It's a film to prize."
God’s Own Country,"A former actor himself, Lee directs his leads with subtle assurance."
God’s Own Country,"Toughness and tenderness duke it out to the bittersweet end of ""God's Own Country,"" a transporting, wrenchingly acted love story set in the windswept wilds of northern England."
God’s Own Country,"A tricky movie, but not in a way that's dishonest."
God’s Own Country,"""God's Own Country"" weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards's biting cinematography and the story's slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful."
God’s Own Country,"Writer-director Francis Lee captures not only what masculinity does and how it comes undone, but the complex apparatus that keeps it into place: the family's surveillance, the silence, the shame."
God’s Own Country,"In the crepuscular light of Brexit, the film resembles a symbolic appeal for tenderness at a time of instability, even if it is really something altogether more conventional: a love story against the odds."
God’s Own Country,"Beneath the grey veneer of rural realism, this is a magical film, one of the best you'll see this year."
God’s Own Country,"The relationship between the two men isn't the only romance in the film, as the camera slowly falls in love with rural Yorkshire."
God’s Own Country,Lee has a lovely eye for symbolic detail - a single light in the farmhouse window glowing through a dawn the colour of slurry emphasises just how alone Johnny is.
God’s Own Country,"The setting of the isolated, muddy farm with the lights of a nearby town invitingly close is beautifully captured by Joshua James Richards's camera."
God’s Own Country,"Some will file God's Own Country under F for fantasy. Others will see it as a portent of rapprochements to come. Either way, it's a winner."
God’s Own Country,"You'll find yourself getting teary a week later - a potent, haunting meditation on the soul-stirring significance of being open to love."
God’s Own Country,"Francis Lee's splendid directorial debut has been billed as a Yorkshire Brokeback Mountain and there are undeniable parallels... God's Own Country, however, is significantly less glamorous than its Oscar-nominated predecessor."
God’s Own Country,"As much as a gay romance - touching, awkward, revelatory - God's Own Country is a story about whom we belong to or choose to belong to."
God’s Own Country,"God's Own Country is hard to fault on its own terms and earns the assumption that lies behind any worthwhile movie romance, that love can take root even in the most unlikely soil."
God’s Own Country,"This is a highly impressive debut feature: bleak and lyrical by turns, and with very fine performances from its two young leads."
God’s Own Country,"It unfolds under grey, blustery spring skies; as lambs emerge blinking and unsteady into the world, so too does this young man's nervous, raw sexuality."
God’s Own Country,A dig into the nature of humanity from a director already fluent in the language of brutality and tenderness. A stunning love story that in its finest moments is pure poetry.
God’s Own Country,"The film has a cumulative power that sneaks up on you even as you think you're keeping track of it, and a twilit afterglow that hasn't faded yet."
God’s Own Country,"This is one of the most assured, fully-formed British debuts of recent years."
God’s Own Country,"Under battered Yorkshire skies, with grime beneath its nails and soil clodding up the treads of its boots, Francis Lee's outstanding feature debut God's Own Country is a work of rough-hewn alchemy."
God’s Own Country,"There will be many people who see themselves in the furtive glances and mud-covered kisses from which ""God's Own Country"" weaves its harsh but hopeful narrative, and they will do so while witnessing a finely crafted piece of cinema."
God’s Own Country,"It is, in its way, a very British love story, bursting at the seams with unspoken emotions, unvoiced fears about the future, and a readiness to displace every emotion into hard physical work."
God’s Own Country,"It feels like the camera is gawking at them rather than joining them, and so all semblance of reality and of the necessary awkwardness of getting their clothes off vanishes. And so too does any real eroticism."
God’s Own Country,A rigorously naturalistic drama that yields stirring performances from the collision between taciturn demeanors and roiling emotional undercurrents.
God’s Own Country,"Skipping some of the more predictable narrative obstacles we've come to expect from the coming-out drama, this sexy, thoughtful, hopeful film instead advances a pro-immigration subtext that couldn't be more timely ..."
God’s Own Country,Lee's love for this hard land and the boy trapped in it - so fully embodied by young British actor Josh O'Connor - is unexpectedly moving and rich.
24 Frames: Before and After…,"Uneven script, but strong performances by a powerhouse cast."
24 Frames: Before and After…,"It's one of those movies where you want to call out helpful advice to the screen, which would save the characters a lot of trouble."

Breath,ERROR
Krystal,Krystal feels like the result of an elaborate blunder wherein three different scripts were accidentally shuffled together and then - presumably through a series of hijinks - the director accidentally shot it all straight through.
Krystal,So baffling that it must be appreciated at least for its ability to defy all logic.
Krystal,"Too forced, chaotic and randomly eccentric to make for a fully engaging and cohesive emotional experience."
Krystal,"""Krystal"" feels chaotic and thin, like a pilot that was also forced to be a series finale."
Krystal,This is the sort of determinedly quirky would-be comedy that induces far more cringes than laughs.
Krystal,Nearly everything these characters do goes beyond the realm of common sense.
Krystal,"Secrets, lies and vast array of medical emergencies beset the game cast before the story goes fully off the rails."
Krystal,"These shenanigans might be amusing if they came with consequences, but big things happen, only to be forgiven or forgotten by the following scene."
Krystal,"The gravity of Krystal's situation is undermined at every turn by the filmmakers' excessively broad, comedic strokes."
Golden Exits,"A movie that gazes deep into its characters' unhappiness and emerges with something searching, sad - and perilously close to likable."
Golden Exits,"Honestly, if it weren't for the performances this would probably be insufferable. But everyone in the film is good."
Golden Exits,"While you'll salute Golden Exits for never going full-on Fatal Attraction, it ends up feeling cagey, trapped in the realm of the theoretical and too hip to raise its tensions above a simmer."
Golden Exits,"The movie seems to be slowly pushing a needle into the lives that it scrutinizes, as if to draw a blood sample and learn what ails the characters."
Golden Exits,"These narcissists declaim their insecurities and grievances in the language of personal essays. What they're saying may be petty and small, but the rhetoric and imagery are transfixing."
Golden Exits,"Think early Whit Stillman without the archness, or Woody Allen without the schtick, self-seriousness or need for post-screening steel-wool shower, and you're almost there."
Golden Exits,"But to what end? Bergman, Cassavetes, and Allen excavated this material decades ago, and there are no new insights uncovered amid the interior lives of these husbands and wives."
Golden Exits,The steadfast refusal to follow through on the premise condemns the film to a state of dramatic constipation.
Golden Exits,"I saw only performers who, with one conspicuous exception, were working hard to ignite a glum drama that declined to combust."
Golden Exits,The more microscopic and incidental the movie gets - as in this candlelit conversation - the grander its cumulative force becomes.
Golden Exits,"Mr. Perry is such a good filmmaker that he can make the embarrassing and the unbearable insistently, fascinatingly engrossing (and often funny)."
Golden Exits,"The collective swell of a thousand nagging disappointments, both identifiable and not, make Perry's film strangely haunting despite the bourgeois mundanity of its events."
Golden Exits,Golden Exits makes one pine to escape the company of its second-rate Woody Allen characters.
Golden Exits,"Alex Ross Perry's characters are shrewd enough to recognize the irrational contours of their lives, which they diagnose and chew over in some of the most inventive, twisty, and richly ironic dialogue in modern American cinema."
Golden Exits,"It is Perry's masterpiece, and one of the finest American films I've seen in many years."
Golden Exits,"These thoughtful people are paralyzed by their ability to look at their lives, and the lives around them, from too many angles. It's enlightening to listen to them, and perhaps a little too familiar."
Golden Exits,"""Golden Exits"" is Brooklyn Bergman, a drama of death pushing from behind and despair looming ahead."
Golden Exits,Nothing in the relationship dynamics here managed to stick.
Golden Exits,"Sevigny is the surprisingly subtle beating heart of the whole affair, while Parker appears to be having a hell of a time being a classic Perry villain."
Golden Exits,"Watching this tremendous, droll micro-masterpiece is like rummaging through a box of privileged misery and holding it up to a light."
Golden Exits,"Given its lack of incident and mostly grumpy and/or off-putting characters, this will not be the film that expands Perry's small audience. But it is something close to superb."
Golden Exits,"An overly serious and pretentious misstep from the filmmaker, who is basically trying to make his Husbands and Wives too early in his career to really pull it off."
Golden Exits,"A dense, defiantly prickly film about ordinary people who don't really do anything."
Golden Exits,"A deadly fusion of the mundane and the affected, like some black-box-theater parody of an Ingmar Bergman art drama."
Golden Exits,"No doubt Alex Ross Perry will follow up the film with a strong return to form, but this film is a collection of half-realized ideas and characters."
Submission,"By the time Lúcia takes the stand, it's not just Miguel who is in the dock but the entire Portuguese judicial system."
Young Lions of Gypsy,ERROR
The Sacrifice,Wexler and Sean Redlitz's script proves strongest when it can be as bonkers as it likes.
The Sacrifice,"Narrative turns, characters that challenge perceptions, and slasher-like bloodletting yield a devilishly fun new entry in holiday horror."
Bigger,"As relatively handsomely mounted as this movie is, it's also kind of a shambles."
Bigger,Without a sturdier script featuring fully dimensional characters... the performances prove to be as unconvincing as their ethnic accents and period wigs.
Bigger,"A missed opportunity, the kind of yo-yo-ing highlights version of a life that seems less examined than expedited."
Wanda (1971) (Re-Release),"Occasionally staggering funny, and it's for those moments that I recommend this."
Black 47,Director Lance Daly has made a bleak and gripping film.
Black 47,"Director and co-writer Lance Daly tells a blunt-force story in blunt-force fashion, draining the color from both landscape and denizens, and spelling out details in dialogue where he thinks it might be helpful."
Black 47,"That it all works as well as it does is as much a testament to the crackerjack cast as it is to Daly's brooding, violently controlled direction."
Black 47,"The movie sits in a murky place between appropriately weary historical drama and a more nimble action-Western hybrid, spurred by an outlaw's revenge"
Black 47,"A visually arresting, Anglo-Irish western-style revenge tale that maintains a firm directorial grip on the foreboding landscape."
Black 47,It's unfortunate that caricatured villains lessen the impact of the film's upward punch.
Black 47,"Despite its Irish setting, Black '47 feels more than anything like an American Western, what with its shades-of-grey morality and almost Biblical quest for payback."
Black 47,"It's not for everyone, but don't believe people who tell you Dubliner Lance Daly's third film is overly bleak or crudely anti-English."
Black 47,Hangs suspended for the most part in an über-glum middle ground that allows neither its emotional or visceral gambits to properly connect.
Black 47,"It's all deeply silly stuff, but within an eerily profound milieu."
Black 47,It was bold and it was well done... accessible and entertaining in that kind of grim way.
Black 47,"Since this is a rare feature film to treat the Irish famine, it's a little odd that it tilts so heavily toward a genre exercise. But as a genre exercise, it's pretty potent."
Black 47,The film's mythic force is underlined by its visual style.
Black 47,"The story glums along earnestly for 100 minutes that seem, and possibly were, 100 days."
Black 47,"Black 47 is a viscerally tough and uncompromisingly violent picture, something like an exploitation shocker at times, though with real insights."
Black 47,"Cold and relentlessly brutal, but there's no emotional payoff."
Black 47,Daly's film is gripping enough to suggest Ireland's tragic backstory is a frontier full of resonant riches.
Black 47,"As the historical specificity embedded in the film's more expansive opening act is abandoned, the more predictable, archetypal trappings of a revenge narrative begin to take hold."
Black 47,"Lean, mean, and singular in the way it mixes genres as well as in its subject matter."
Black 47,The grey pools of Declan Quinn's cinematography and the evocative strains of Brian Byrne's score - keening traditional flourishes balanced by angular melodies - keep the brain twitching in even the glummest moments.
Black 47,"Using the 'Great Hunger' as a backdrop for a revenge western is an interesting way to exorcise old ghosts, but the end result drains pathos from the tragedy while muting The Proposition-style genre elements."
Black 47,Black 47 feels more like a small screen misfire than the grand cinematic epic that this rich story deserves.
Black 47,"Daly's restrained, pared-down style is the opposite of flashy exploitation cinema, but watching these bastions of lethally repressive British rule get some overdue comeuppance is similarly stirring."
Black 47,"By the time it ends on a note of intimate ambiguity, it's hard not to wish that Black 47 had expressed more shades of gray."
A Kid Like Jake,"Danes gives it her very considerable best, but there is something weirdly inhibited about this movie."
A Kid Like Jake,"It's a demonstration of a parent's most innate instinct: to protect their child, while also intimating that love and understanding is the ultimate protection."
A Kid Like Jake,"It's a daring premise, which makes Howard's fluffy approach to the material all the more frustrating."
A Kid Like Jake,"But the filmmakers seem to hold back from other confrontations, and their subplots involving the boy's pushy grandmother (the great Ann Dowd) and a brittle client (Amy Landecker) of the therapist father ultimately fizzle."
A Kid Like Jake,"The movie's premise sounds like it should be the basis for a barbed satire of the finest proportions. Instead, it opts for a tone that is decidedly sober and lacking any kind of sharp edge."
A Kid Like Jake,"Some of this material is too sensitive, granted, to have a very young actor play it. But ""Jake"" goes too far the other way, giving us only glimpses of the boy, who emerges as more of a symbol than a real child."
A Kid Like Jake,"It's like the Alex-and-Greg of woke-era problem pictures: bright, earnest and compassionate, if maybe just a little too much in its own head."
A Kid Like Jake,"An authentic, conversational messiness we rarely see on screen."
A Kid Like Jake,"""A Kid Like Jake"" tackles the tricky topic of gender dysphoria with sensitivity and grace."
A Kid Like Jake,Feels more like playwriting than like screenwriting because we are told things in dialogue about Jake but barely ever get to see him behaving -- doesn't it signal the same kind of avoidance or fear that the movie itself is supposed to be about?
A Kid Like Jake,"This film is a cynical but spot-on take on the world we live in today, where even Lego-loving tykes become wrapped up in movements."
A Kid Like Jake,The material is begging for a thick layer of irony or self-awareness that never arrives. It's like an Ira Sachs film that took the wrong subway exit.
A Kid Like Jake,"But the well-made point is that gender assignments aren't always intelligently designed, at least not for a world built out of boxes that come only in pink or blue."
A Kid Like Jake,"This is not a film about falling apart, but all the conversations and compromises that hold things together."
A Kid Like Jake,"""A Kid Like Jake"" is humane, compassionate and strangely detached, almost to the point of inconsequentiality."
A Kid Like Jake,"Howard's uneven and pedestrian commercial-meets-single-camera-sitcom direction tries to compensate for the extreme staginess of the script, which was adapted by Daniel Pearle from his same-titled play."
A Kid Like Jake,"This family drama often feels like a therapy session, perhaps because Parsons plays a therapist; the talky nature of the film lends itself to too much idle pondering and meandering side plots."
A Kid Like Jake,"""A Kid Like Jake"" might not be especially cinematic, but it is profound in its simplicity and truthfulness about what real fights sound like and what real lives look like."
A Kid Like Jake,Silas Howard's film feels like a scenario from a textbook about handling a child's gender nonconformity.
A Kid Like Jake,"The movie doesn't feel like it's going anywhere until it explodes, and the dazzling fireworks don't quite offset its long, seemingly aimless fuse."
A Kid Like Jake,"This might be the start of a long and winding path, but it's no small thing for A Kid Like Jake to so clearly illustrate how love is always going to be the path of least resistance."
A Kid Like Jake,Simply lovely ...
Bomb City,An empathetic drama ready to put straight-laced audiences in the shoes of a maligned subculture.
Bomb City,"""Bomb City"" just keeps on having its Caucasian adolescents scream into the ether until you get it: angry middle-American teenagers are all not alike!"
Bomb City,"The film's message, which it wields like a war chain, is a timeless one: Don't be such a dick to people because they look different from you. We all live in Bomb City: One stray match and the whole thing will explode."
Bomb City,"""Bomb City"" will keep you in its grasp during every moment leading to its climactic violence. And it won't let go until the closing credits roll."
Bomb City,"A tense, finely observed Texas crime drama, produced on a tight budget and suggesting great promise for its Dallas-based filmmakers."
Where is Kyra?,"""Where is Kyra?"" is a small story - there's much about its main character that we'll never know - and a terribly sad one. But it's a remarkable showcase for Pfeiffer, who'll break your heart in every scene."
Where is Kyra?,"Pfeiffer is good - she's always good, and raw, and effective - but watching her here is like seeing her under glass from a block away."
Where is Kyra?,"This woman may be lost to the world, but in Dosunmu's quietly shattering vision, she is also unexpectedly, triumphantly found."
Where is Kyra?,"Gosh, but it's good to have Michelle Pfeiffer back."
Where is Kyra?,"Picoult's screenplay is frustratingly slight, never evolving beyond...one note."
Where is Kyra?,"The script, by Darci Picoult, does little to illuminate thoughts, plans, and lives; the banal dialogue is delivered at a slow and pause-riddled pace, as if to infuse it with meaning and emotion that it doesn't contain."
Where is Kyra?,"It's a performance of such nuance and vulnerability, so quietly catastrophic in communicating this woman's accumulation of loss."
Where is Kyra?,"Michelle Pfeiffer is stunning as a desperate, near-destitute woman whose life is shrouded in darkness."
Where is Kyra?,"Where Is Kyra? finally allows [Pfeiffer] to explore the darker, unvarnished side of her talent and gives her the opportunity to do perhaps the best work of her lengthy, eclectic career."
Where is Kyra?,That we watch the ticking moments of Where Is Kyra? with so much concern is a testament to the filmmakers and cast determined to elevate her unnoticed life.
Where is Kyra?,"As a statement about the economic insecurity inherent in American capitalism, ""Where Is Kyra?"" has grim power."
Where is Kyra?,Michelle Pfeiffer's entrancing performance is more than capable of commanding people to watch.
Where is Kyra?,"Terror gradually leaks into the narrative, transforming Where Is Kyra? into a haunting non-traditional thriller."
Where is Kyra?,"It ultimately doesn't have much to say apart from the basic observation that life is very, very hard for people with zero resources. But it depicts that punishing world with singular artistry."
Where is Kyra?,"At every beat, Pfeiffer poignantly conveys Kyra's misery, from the quieter hopeless moments to the more frantically despondent. And the actress' finesse makes it worth the watch."
Where is Kyra?,"A shattering portrait of a luckless woman unable to pull out of the tailspin that is her life, ""Where Is Kyra?"" is a powerfully moody character study anchored by a remarkable performance from Michelle Pfeiffer."
Where is Kyra?,Pfeiffer is nothing short of heartbreaking in a part that requires her to be completely unvarnished.
Where is Kyra?,"It's been years since we've been treated to a great Michelle Pfeiffer performance, and Where Is Kyra finally gives her that platform."
Where is Kyra?,Rarely on film has the sheer debilitating exhaustion of poverty been so clearly conveyed.
Where is Kyra?,"A soul-searing Michelle Pfeiffer makes a welcome return in Andrew Dosunmu's difficult, visually stunning essay in psychic pain."
Where is Kyra?,Where is Kyra? sheds a most exquisitely modulated penumbral light on those in the margins of society that would normally remain invisible.
Viper Club,Susan Sarandon knows how to pick a character; it's her taste in scripts that we need worry about.
Viper Club,There's just enough to make the film a cut above your average headline-driven drama and not quite enough to shoot it into the stratosphere.
Viper Club,"There are a number of interesting things going on in ""Viper Club."" Unfortunately, too few of them are happening on screen."
Viper Club,"Even the best movies push emotional buttons, but they work because viewers become wrapped up in the story. This one is so manipulative you can hear the gears grinding - until they lock up."
Viper Club,She's walking an emotional tightrope. Sarandon walks it with no missteps. It's a remarkable performance.
Viper Club,"The film eschews a Hollywood happy ending in favor of bone-chilling reality, which makes Viper Club doubly relevant amid current headlines."
Viper Club,"While the reality that inspired its story is shocking and disturbing, the resulting film finally is not."
Viper Club,"It's capital-I important and timely. But without its star's passionate, nuanced performance, it would run the risk of being a bit generic and forgettable."
Viper Club,"It relies on infuriating, heart-tugging tricks that do not inform and simply do not work."
Viper Club,It is mostly gripping.
Viper Club,"This is a slow-burning movie, but its stealth and intelligence eventually packs an emotional punch."
Viper Club,"An empathetic turn by Susan Sarandon as an anxious mother whose journalist son is being held hostage by overseas extremists is enough to hold together ""Viper Club."""
Viper Club,"A movie that, despite an intriguing subject matter and a surprise ending that leaves you with more questions than answers, ultimately feels stronger in its message than in its execution."
My Friend Dahmer,"Although My Friend Dahmer does not resolve the impossible question of 'nature vs nurture', it approaches it with a humanity that is too often missing from such stories."
My Friend Dahmer,"Isn't there something pathological about the way we privilege the pathological? If you can stomach the focus of My Friend Dahmer, you'll find this rewarding."
My Friend Dahmer,"My Friend Dahmer is nonetheless a sad film about squandered opportunity. Everybody is losing out in this grim, claustrophobic version of the late 1970s."
My Friend Dahmer,"It makes for something that ends up being sadder, weirder, more boring - but more convincing - than the average serial killer movie."
My Friend Dahmer,"The whole assembly kit of Jeffrey Dahmer's dysfunction is laid out, and we can easily see how it all clicks together. The film might have risked more empathy for him, if that weren't the one thing he so signally lacked himself."
My Friend Dahmer,"There's a hint of retrospective guilt here and you could question Backderf's morals, and by extension those of Meyers, for profiting from telling a murderer's origin story."
My Friend Dahmer,"Ross Lynch is eerily good as Dahmer, like a very young Philip Seymour Hoffman - stolidly silent, heavy-footed, incubating his resentments."
My Friend Dahmer,Lynch's opaque performance deliberately keeps you at a distance and avoids any easy answers.
My Friend Dahmer,Films like My Friend Dahmer heighten the mystery rather than explaining it.
My Friend Dahmer,An eerily hypnotic film.
My Friend Dahmer,"A small, slight window into a mixed-up soul, this is more intriguing than engaging. Its restraint, though, is admirable, resulting in a mood-piece with an ongoing sense of unease."
My Friend Dahmer,"Knowing what we know now about Dahmer's future, this is pretty chilling stuff."
My Friend Dahmer,"Meyers makes ""My Friend Dahmer"" a convincing high school drama, but his portrait of the serial killer as a young man telegraphs Dahmer's future all too clearly."
My Friend Dahmer,"My Friend Dahmer is at its most provocative when it considers this dynamic between the exploiters and the exploited. In making Dahmer feel like a freak, did the boys push him over the edge into a murderous contempt for all people?"
My Friend Dahmer,"Which came first, bullies or dead animals in jars? ""Friend"" does not say, nor is there a clear link between the discord in Jeff's home and his behavior."
My Friend Dahmer,It seeks not to excuse Dahmer but rather to illuminate his sociopathy.
My Friend Dahmer,A morbidly fascinating peek behind the blood-stained curtains.
My Friend Dahmer,A warped wonder of a movie about a cannibalistic serial killer's awkward teenage years-it takes twisted to areas few have investigated.
My Friend Dahmer,"Writer-director Marc Meyers turns Backderf's celebrated book into an absorbing, dramatized portrait of casual cruelty and teenage desperation, equal parts The Virgin Suicides and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre."
My Friend Dahmer,"More than a week after watching writer-director Marc Meyers' My Friend Dahmer, I'm still trying to figure out who exactly the film is meant for and why on earth it was made."
My Friend Dahmer,[Ross] Lynch is opaque in the spookiest way.
My Friend Dahmer,Meyers recreates Dahmer's world so wholly that you don't leave with questions even if the big one remains purposely unanswered.
My Friend Dahmer,"It's a nuanced and sad high school movie, a portrait of lonely, damaged youth that only gradually reveals itself as the origin story of a psychopath."
My Friend Dahmer,"The world may never tire of being fascinated with serial killers, but ""My Friend Dahmer"" avoids exploitation often enough to forge its own perceptive, tense, character-driven path."
My Friend Dahmer,"My Friend Dahmer is both sensitive and fascinating, distinguished by a stellar, mouth-breathing performance of insecurity from [Ross] Lynch."
My Friend Dahmer,"This film is sensitively wrought. It's credible in its evocation of mid-'70s suburbia. The acting is excellent throughout, and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul."
My Friend Dahmer,"... an eerie and effective portrait of serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer in his beyond-troubled teen years, a quick hop into the mind of a loner kid who was about to become a monster."
My Friend Dahmer,"The film wants to treat Jeffrey Dahmer like a character, but it invariably frames him like a specimen."
My Friend Dahmer,My Friend Dahmer is one of the most disturbing coming-of-age features in memory. But it's also exceptionally moving.
My Friend Dahmer,"Jeffrey Dahmer was a real person, with a family and at least a couple of casual friends. The people he killed were, too. The discomfort of reconciling those two facts is where this film lives, and what ultimately makes it work."
My Friend Dahmer,"There is such a chasm between the unreadable character we see and the extraordinary grisliness of Dahmer's crimes that this depiction is as helpful as those inevitable attributions of mass murderers as ""quiet, normal-seeming"" men from shocked neighbors."
My Friend Dahmer,"We already know the monster Dahmer will become, but Meyers also focuses on the better person he might have been, and the toxic formative experiences that prevent this & mould his tragic trajectory, pushing him into living up to his own cult image."
My Friend Dahmer,"At the core is an unnerving and mesmerizing performance by Austin & Ally star Lynch, who may have managed the most revolutionary reinvention for a Disney Channel alum since Ryan Gosling."
My Friend Dahmer,"It aims to capitalize on our perverse fascination with the Milwaukee Cannibal, while congratulating ourselves for finding a moral message in his tragedy."
My Friend Dahmer,I'm still not quite sure how they made this work - but they did.
My Friend Dahmer,It sees Jeffrey Dahmer for what he was: a young man who could express himself only through the most hideous violence. Yet it shows you that what he had to express was real.
Where Hands Touch,"I found myself looking at it and liking certain parts, but I didn't get emotionally swept up...but it great that the film happened, in itself there's a sense of relief and triumph there..."
Where Hands Touch,It's a fascinating take on the horrors of World War II and one that confirms [Amandla] Stenberg as one of the most accomplished rising stars of her generation.
Where Hands Touch,"If Asante's idea is that Nazi ideology poisoned bright young minds into viewing their fellow citizens as less than human, the lovey-dovey bond she's pushing as the main event seems even more implausible."
Where Hands Touch,The film gives us elements of melodrama and also of epic - yet there is also something a little uncomfortable about it.
Where Hands Touch,Where Hands Touch is ultimately let down by a deeply contrived narrative and tone-deaf melodramatic style which only serves to diminish the importance and urgency of the real life stories behind Assante's screenplay.
Where Hands Touch,"While Asante's earlier films were grounded in reality and successfully linked the problems facing their protagonists to contemporary aspects of racism, Where Hands Touch seems unduly contrived."
Where Hands Touch,"In the end it feels like a school play, and not a very good one."
Where Hands Touch,Where Hands Touch is unfortunately as problematic as we assumed; the questions it raises about national vs. cultural identity didn't need a Nazi romance to be resonant.
Where Hands Touch,"Where Hands Touch is a waste of solid acting by Amandla Stenberg, and time for its viewers. Asante's attempt to make Nazi characters appear sympathetic is a perfect example of not reading the room, especially in this contentious time in our country."
Where Hands Touch,"Pity, considering the filmmaker's resume and the subject matter, this film should have been compelling."
Where Hands Touch,"Where Hands Touch is a coming of age story, a saga of war, and a heart-rending love story about a forbidden romance that defied the odds against survival in a living hell."
Where Hands Touch,"Asante usually excels at sharing stories audiences haven't seen before, so it's unfortunate that this one feels so dully familiar."
Where Hands Touch,Asante maintains a firm grasp of her story at all times but the backdrop is occasionally flimsy.
Where Hands Touch,A gut-wrenching misfire.
Where Hands Touch,"When the complex, humanizing portrayal of Nazi characters and SS soldiers enter the picture, good intentions do derail fast, leading to disturbing outcomes."
Where Hands Touch,"Throughout, Asante raises questions about bravery, conscience and, most of all, identity."
Where Hands Touch,"Stenberg carries the magnetism she brought to her breakthrough role in the YA romance ""Everything, Everything,"" but she's betrayed by a stilted rendering of a rarely illuminated piece of history."
Where Hands Touch,"It's a film entirely devoid of subtlety yet one that also fails to provide the grand emotion it yearns to deliver, despite the use of a sledgehammer."
Outside In,Edie Falco gives her most vulnerable and nuanced performance...
Outside In,"Lynn Shelton wrote and directed two superior indie comedies, Humpday (2009) and Your Sister's Sister (2011)... Now she's back with an engrossing drama about love and circumstance, and there isn't a false note from start to finish."
Outside In,"What keeps Outside In interesting throughout is the nuanced work of its so very watchable leads - especially Duplass, who spent the first half of his career behind the camera writing, directing, and producing film and TV with his brother Mark."
Outside In,"Director Lynn Shelton brings a high empathic bar to Outside In, then dares the audience to clear it."
Outside In,"The power of these performances is that you leave thinking that Chris and Carol are out there, somewhere, and you wish them well."
Outside In,"[Lynn Shelton's] actors are always natural and unaffected, but in [Edie] Falco and [Jay] Duplass, she's found interpreters who seem to breathe her characters."
Outside In,"This is an conversation- and character-driven film with an occasional eye for something more ineffable, but Falco and Duplass's complicated, nakedly searching performances are the main event."
Outside In,"Takes some time to develop that tension into something genuinely dramatic, but Falco's performance is strong enough to make the film compelling even in its softest moments."
Outside In,"Another one of Shelton's delightfully untucked meanders into the crossroads of lives, Outside In may be her quietly affecting best yet."
Outside In,"What makes Outside In compelling isn't the way these stories move toward their inevitable conclusions, but in how these characters experience their journeys."
Outside In,Shelton has a knack for three-way relationship studies; she knows exactly how to braid together two characters in a way that comments insightfully on a third.
Outside In,"Exploring big questions through small, intimate moments, ""Outside In"" is a love story that prioritizes patience and pragmatism over passion."
Outside In,"What elevates this lovely film above the run of the mill is Falco's heartbreaking, note-perfect performance."
Outside In,"The quiet, dark tableaux fit the subject matter well, and Falco is reliably strong as a woman in the throes of a moral dilemma."
Outside In,"Shelton's forte remains live-wire, semi-improvised comedies involving competitive neurotics, at which she's better than just about anybody else currently working."
Outside In,"Lynn Shelton's film firmly resists supplying its main characters with easy, you-can-have-it-all answers."
Outside In,"Shelton's best-known films are comedy/dramas with an accent on the former; this one leans more towards drama, which is a bit of a disappointment, since she's honed such a specific and welcome comic voice. But it's full of little flashes of truth."
Outside In,Jay Duplass and Edie Falco anchor the movie with some of the very best performances in both of their careers.
Outside In,"A love story whose resolution remains tough to predict, Outside In respects all its characters by not pretending their choices are easily made."
Outside In,"A breezy, earnest film about powerful connections and lost time, but it never quite gets off the ground like it should."
Outside In,"Shelton and Duplass lend every significant character a sense of uncontrived evolution, leading to a finale that is stirring precisely for being so tentative and reserved."
"Nico, 1988","Overall, this kind of compassionate dismantling of Nico the myth is done with insight, tenderness, and clear-eyed realism."
"Nico, 1988","Trine Dyrholm as the aging relic is superb, nailing down all the fits of paranoia, druggy ticks, and Nico's own fallen spirit."
"Nico, 1988",Nicchiarelli and Dyrholm impressively fly in the face of that logic with a film that is eulogistic and hopeful.
"Nico, 1988","""I'm selective about my audience,"" says the singer. ""I don't need everybody to like me."" With a dour, sophisticated film that won't be to everyone's taste, writer-director Nicchiarelli seems to have taken those words to heart."
"Nico, 1988","Dyrholm is aces as Nico. She uncannily summons the singer's brooding performing style, along with her many complications."
"Nico, 1988","""Nico, 1988"" is worth a look... for its portrait of a spirit absolutely unyielding, who expected the worst from life and found cold, beautiful comfort when she got it."
"Nico, 1988","There is a low-key blandness to Susanna Nicchiarelli's film... elevated by a subtle, powerful performance by German actress Trine Dyrholm, whose complex and spot-on portrayal of Nico gives the film soul, albeit a lonely one."
"Nico, 1988","The film leaves one feeling that few humans have ever been quite so alone as Christa Päffgen, and yet so crowded."
"Nico, 1988","Yet the star of Susanna Nicchiarelli's freely fictionalized biopic, Trine Dyrholm, finds fierce beauty in the woman Nico has become."
"Nico, 1988","Instead, she concentrates on how this woman's self-destructive charisma kept people around her and chaos around every corner - this is Nico as a black-hole sun."
"Nico, 1988","While the film deserves praise for its unglamorous approach to a sad-girl icon, the narrow focus can be tiring, and Nico's relationships with the other characters, including her estranged son, are frustratingly enigmatic."
"Nico, 1988","Dyrholm, an actress of formidable presence who expertly handles her own singing as well as the acting, gives a strong, truthful, unflinching performance that powers the film the way Christa's energy powered the bands she was in those late days."
"Nico, 1988","It's a strange but effective music biopic, delighting in the far end of fame and making a studious critical case for the artist's later work that nevertheless lionizes the early stuff."
"Nico, 1988",The movie is best of all a showcase for Dyrholm's full-fledged interpretation of Nico.
"Nico, 1988","Dyrholm's performance anchors everything. It relies little on physical impersonation, even though her singing voice captures Nico's unmistakable, late-career deadpan cry, a foghorn of mourning that sounded then and now like no one else's."
"Nico, 1988","[Dyrholm] plays Nico as perplexing and intriguing, ethereal yet earthy. She manages to make the viewer understand why some people wanted to be around the singer, even though she was demanding, exasperating and untrustworthy - in short, a junkie."
"Nico, 1988","[A] precise, piercing study of the star's last years."
"Nico, 1988","Ms. Nicchiarelli, using brief archival flickers of Warhol's Factory parties, deftly connects the carefree chaos of Päffgen's past to the dark desperation of her present."
"Nico, 1988","The unflashy, austere visual style of the film is but a veneer over writer-director Susanna Nicchiarelli's deceptively radical treatment of the musical biopic."
"Nico, 1988","As a self-obsessed junkie, spectacularly failed mother and demanding diva, there should be nothing sympathetic about her, but Susanna Nicchiarelli's biopic effectively evokes the melancholy of missed greatness."
"Nico, 1988","Nico, 1988 is as wary and lived-in as its subject."
"Nico, 1988","Because [Susanna] Nicchiarelli gets all of that, Nico, 1988 never devolves into a sob story."
"Nico, 1988",There's something beautiful and vaguely redemptive to the way Nicchiarelli's film gives the singer one last chance to change her ways.
"Nico, 1988","It seems awfully ironic that an artist as canonically underground as Nico should receive so conventional a treatment in a biopic. But as traditional narratives about creators go, this one is not half bad."
"Nico, 1988","""Nico, 1988"" ... understands the mystique of her anti-mystique, and deserves to attract a small but fascinated audience on the specialty circuit."
"Nico, 1988","Nicchiarelli dives deeply into the life of a tragic but remarkable woman, memorably portrayed by Danish actress and singer Trine Dyrholm as an unpleasant, hurtful junkie plagued with memories and regrets."
Claire’s Camera,"I'm not entirely sure why the film works. Its a blithe disinterest in telling a conventional story will leave some viewers, even discerning ones, feeling unsatisfied."
Claire’s Camera,"At 69 minutes, ""Claire's Camera""...is among Hong's shortest movies. But it feels complete, just the right amount of time to spend part of a weekend at Cannes with some charmingly dysfunctional people."
Claire’s Camera,"The actors are all terrific. Jung makes So so self-aware that you can, at least for a time, abide his abject selfishness. Nam is complex; she's difficult to like at first, but she has reasons for her behavior."
Claire’s Camera,"""Claire's Camera"" runs 68 minutes and is as slender and unassuming, in its own way, as a Polaroid. But you may emerge from it not feeling like quite the same person, either."
Claire’s Camera,"Hong is an acute observer of the subtleties at play in each interaction, of the tiny power shifts that can take place over the course of a conversation."
Claire’s Camera,"Claire's Camera is, like many of Hong's best comedies before it, amusing without necessarily being laugh-out-loud funny."
Claire’s Camera,"Ms. Huppert's presence - steady, warm, thoughtful but with a casual air - keeps the entire enterprise classically comedic."
Claire’s Camera,"For all its airy lightness and apparent simplicity, it's hard not to watch Claire's Camera and sense beneath its placid surfaces the fretful voice of a filmmaker who longs to return to the elements of his art."
Claire’s Camera,Hong Sang-soo's Claire's Camera is governed by a narrative circle that suggests relief as well as entrapment.
Claire’s Camera,A thoroughly engaging divertissement.
Claire’s Camera,"Hong distills vast emotional crises and creative self-recognitions into confessional monologues, pugnacious discussions, and luminous aphorisms."
Claire’s Camera,"The direction in Claire's Camera is less elaborate, reflecting the on-the-fly conditions of its production. The film's pleasures lie more in the improvisational feel of the dialogues and the charming chemistry between the characters."
Claire’s Camera,"The breezy Claire's Camera isn't only charming and funny, but also one of Hong's most formally intuitive and sharply written films in some time."
Claire’s Camera,A short and sweet divertissement with a few profound punchlines.
Claire’s Camera,"A trifle compared to such recent Hong highs as ""Right Now, Wrong Then"" and ""On the Beach at Night Alone,"" but a complete work on its own light terms."
Nostalgia,[A] meandering but richly detailed drama.
Nostalgia,"It’s a sad, melancholic movie, superbly orchestrated and perfectly played. Won’t do much for the reputation of Naples though."
Nostalgia,Absorbing after you’ve made it through the first 20 minutes.
Nostalgia,"If yielding to nostalgia often makes people recall a more affectionate and wistful version of what actually was, this stirring, evocative film likely will leave viewers haunted by what might have been."
Nostalgia,"Martone’s depiction of crime is at once expressive and economic, a world of danger boiled down to pregnant pauses and minute gestures."
Nostalgia,"Mario Martone’s beautifully shot and superbly composed film teeters on the edge of something special. And if it doesn’t quite achieve that, settling in the end for something more generically crime-oriented, it’s still very good."
Nostalgia,"The deep dive into this specific urban milieu is gratifying; you can practically inhale the smells of the open markets, the garbage, the run-down buildings, the motorbike exhaust and, once and a while, the purer air of the churches."
Nostalgia,"The film... is far from perfect, but it does benefit from “The Traitor” star Pierfrancesco Favino’s terrific lead performance as a man who learns the hard way that there’s no going home again."
Nostalgia,"A siren song to the past that confronts us with a violent, unromantic present, paved under with the same old, blood-washed cobblestones."
Nostalgia,"With a formidable cast, assured direction and skillful camerawork, Nostalgia proves to be a surprisingly absorbing film, one that could find audiences outside of Italy."
Running for Grace,Predictable but pleasant drama about love and prejudice in 1920s Hawaii
The Breadwinner,"A fantastical myth, woven through the propulsive main story, serves as a distraction to the characters in their most distressed moments. Story as lesson. Story as history. Also, story as entertainment. Story as escape."
The Breadwinner,"Along with the eerie beauty of the animation there is a salving streak of humour that softens this tale's sharper edges, reminding us that - for children - laughter and bravery walk hand in hand."
The Breadwinner,This beautiful and continually surprising film makes us think about what children can and can't bear.
The Breadwinner,This is a day-to-day survival story that stirs the heart and fires the imagination.
The Breadwinner,"Not the most obvious subjects for a family animation, but The Breadwinner tackles them all with devastating economy."
The Breadwinner,"The Breadwinner is thrillingly alive with the delicacy, artistry and wit of human touch."
The Breadwinner,"A fiery takedown of fundamentalism, bigotry and oppression of all stripes."
The Breadwinner,There's a calmness and clarity to this engaging animation...
The Breadwinner,"Against the odds, the tone here is optimistic about human nature. The film even manages to be uplifting, a small miracle given the darkness of its themes."
The Breadwinner,"The story-within-a-story device doesn't work, but it's still the most thoughtful, sensitively realised, beautifully drawn and affecting animation about children in wartime since Grave Of The Fireflies."
The Breadwinner,You can't tell a tale of fanaticism's evil without violence; so violence there is. And pain; and grief; and sharp-clawed deprivation.
The Breadwinner,A rare animated film without a shred of sentimentality but bucket-loads of heart and soul.
The Breadwinner,"Children must grow up fast under such circumstances, and The Breadwinner derives its lasting sense of tragedy from its consideration of how they've been stripped of their childhood. There's a sad undercurrent to Parvana's fairy tale."
The Breadwinner,"But most importantly, they provide a window to others' experiences. And that's the first step toward empathy."
The Breadwinner,"The animation is expressive, as lush and detailed as tapestry. Harsh landscapes shimmer with beauty, even when littered with the bones of landmines and abandoned tanks."
The Breadwinner,The film is honest enough not to exaggerate the beneficial results of Parvana's courageous act.
The Breadwinner,On the heels of Ann Marie Fleming's joyful animated indie Window Horses comes Nora Twomey's thematically similar but far darker The Breadwinner.
The Breadwinner,American families deserve to see this excellent film.The Breadwinneris a visually striking feature with a relatable young heroine; it is as fresh and relevant as any movie of 2017
The Breadwinner,"Parvana's eloquent eyes convey the tragedy of a land under siege, and the terrible fate which befalls each family member in turn is beautifully animated."
The Breadwinner,"The Breadwinner is a well-crafted and inspiring story with an important message about female empowerment, embodied in heroic Parvana, something people of all ages should embrace."
The Breadwinner,"Visually captivating even when it's narratively uneven, the animated film ""The Breadwinner"" tells the story of a brave girl living in Afghanistan under the Taliban in the lead-up to the 2001 U.S. invasion."
The Breadwinner,"One can only salute the filmmakers' ambition and seriousness of purpose, but it's hard to see who ""The Breadwinner"" audience is."
The Breadwinner,[The Breadwinner] is a harrowing-and spellbinding-exploration of life under Taliban rule.
The Breadwinner,"While the film may suffer when it comes to the details, it does have a certain undeniable power in its broad strokes."
The Breadwinner,"In its power and its beauty, ""The Breadwinner' reminds us that animation can be every bit as much of a medium for adults as it is for children."
The Breadwinner,"Harsh disappointments befall the characters, and they are depicted frankly, but in a way that encourages young viewers to form an affinity with the characters rather than cringe at terror."
The Breadwinner,"Cross-dressing in the story is merely a tool for survival, but such border-crossing is inevitably rife with unintended consequences beyond narrative ones."
The Breadwinner,"It directly confronts the misogyny and chauvinism of contemporary Afghanistan, while powerfully suggesting that storytelling is both a means of coping and a solution for change."
The Breadwinner,Jewel-bright and heart-wrenching.
The Breadwinner,"The Breadwinner is a glorious demonstration of the power of myth to deal with brutal reality, and the power of truth to animate myth."
The Breadwinner,"There's room for humour, too, especially within the magical stories Parvana narrates, a complementary storyline rendered with breathtaking imagery and packing an emotional gut punch."
The Breadwinner,The picture sings and inspires.
Wonder Wheel,"Winslet steals the show as the yearning wife, but the real star is veteran cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (The Conformist, Apocalypse Now, The Last Emperor)."
Wonder Wheel,"Allen was no doubt aiming for the luxuriant melancholy of a Douglas Sirk film or the brash sleaze of Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running. However, there's an oily, deep-fried quality ..."
Wonder Wheel,Winslet's stunning turn is worth a look if you can stand the consciously stagey feel.
Wonder Wheel,Kate Winslet delivers an incendiary performance (easily her best since 2008 in The Reader)...
Wonder Wheel,"Winslet seems to be fighting a war against Allen's direction, and everything goes to pot."
Wonder Wheel,The plot and the structure undercut the affection Allen has for his salt-of-the-seaside characters. The writer-director falls in love with a tidy narrative arc that ends up more like a vicious circle.
Wonder Wheel,Wonder Wheel sums up [Allen's] career nicely (this is not wholly a compliment).
Wonder Wheel,"There is lots of expository dialogue and characters saying lines like: ""I've become consumed with jealousy!"""
Wonder Wheel,"Wonder Wheel and its recent predecessors suggest that Allen is not just out of favour but out of ideas. You get the feeling that, one way or other, time's up."
Wonder Wheel,"This is an oedipal drama about shame, guilt and sexual betrayal. Allen throws in a few gags - but not very many."
Wonder Wheel,"Woody Allen seems to be running on empty now, situating his stories in cliched versions of the past, slapping together character and situations with little care or passion, except as bile and bitterness take him."
Wonder Wheel,"Allen, 82, has his ups and downs, and while there have been more downs than ups lately he is always worth the benefit of the doubt. But ""Wonder Wheel"" is a ride to nowhere."
Wonder Wheel,"Like the fairground ride for which it's named, ""Wonder Wheel"" is entertaining but not enlightening."
Wonder Wheel,"As we watch Allen worry and nitpick over the way women fret over aging, painting Ginny as pathetic, jealous, insecure, and clownish, it's dull, unoriginal, and offensive. Frankly, we've have enough Woody Allen takes on this subject."
Wonder Wheel,Wonder Wheel seems more like a cobbled-together afterthought than the romantic melodrama it seeks to be.
Wonder Wheel,Allen's influences seem to combine the drama of Tennessee Williams and other American playwrights of the 1940s and 50s with the wonderfully garish visual style of directors such as Douglas Sirk. Think Sweet Bird of Youth meets Written on the Wind.
Wonder Wheel,"It's as if Allen is disinterested in his own material, his unfocused meanderings from one event to the next making Ginny's story more of an exercise in selfish materialistic excess than it is anything substantive."
Wonder Wheel,"If you're still open to [Woodie Allen] as an important American artist, this is definitely one to put on your list."
Wonder Wheel,"If 2016's Café Society was writer-director Woody Allen's attempt to introduce a younger generation to the world of Woody Allen, then this might just be his followup attempt to show the Kids of Today what a filmed Tennessee Williams play looks like."
Wonder Wheel,"Whatever its director's motivations, a work so contemptuous of its own heroine is always going to border on the offensive."
Wonder Wheel,Everything strains to serve an underwritten story that resembles a community theatre stage production more than a major motion picture.
Wonder Wheel,"Otherwise, the move shows evidence of Allen's late-career bad habits: The script plays like an unedited rough draft, or the work of someone who no longer has anyone to tell him he needs to try harder."
Wonder Wheel,"[A] well-acted, yet pointless and, most disappointingly, dull tale of lust."
Wonder Wheel,"Line to line, ""Wonder Wheel"" clunks and groans."
Wonder Wheel,"As is the case with most of Allen's films in the last 25 years or so, the script plays like a first draft, with the characters spouting stilted dialogue you'd never use in conversation, much less ever say out loud."
Wonder Wheel,The dialogue is agony. Winslet is given some especial doozies to deliver with a straight face.
Wonder Wheel,"""Wonder Wheel"" will strike fans as an embarrassment and doubters as further evidence of decline - proof of Allen's lack of interest or engagement in a world beyond his shrinking artistic comfort zone."
Wonder Wheel,"Even without the Allen creep factor or the off-tone lines, Wonder Wheel is an exaggerated jumble. Everything feels more artificial than his usual work and that's saying a lot for an Allen movie."
Wonder Wheel,"Then again, there is something artificial, or at least heightened and operatic, about the entire movie - the sets, the colors, the situations, the performers."
Wonder Wheel,"All hokum. All window dressing for a limp, underwhelming, irritating soap opera."
Wonder Wheel,It's just a bad movie; a flat melodrama in which some lovely camerawork and a ferocious central performance from Winslet can't conceal the rote tiredness of it all.
Wonder Wheel,"I've often written that even on a bad day, Woody Allen is better than everybody else on Sunday. This is true again of Wonder Wheel."
Wonder Wheel,"Rather than loose, the ensemble often seems underrehearsed, and too many of Winslet's lines have little impact."
Wonder Wheel,"That's what's missing from the movie: pleasure. Allen is apparently trying to channel Eugene O'Neill in his portrayal of this forlorn family, but Wonder Wheel is no Long Day's Journey Into Night. It's not even long; it just feels that way"
Wonder Wheel,"This is sophisticated filmmaking, but so what? Wonder Wheel is magical in a superficial way; it has a surface beauty that can't disguise the material's basic banality and ugliness-or the feeling that we've seen it all before."
Wonder Wheel,"A fresh Woody Allen movie arrives practically every year like clockwork. Some are good - most are middling. Being prolific isn't a crime, but with Allen, what you often get are retreads dolled up to look brand-new."
Wonder Wheel,Woody's Allen's period drama feels more like a stage play than a film - its claustrophobic atmosphere can be stifling. But Kate Winslet is a bonfire that burns through every scene.
Wonder Wheel,"The actors do their best to bring the characters to life, but cannot do much with a repetitive, underwritten script and sour, dreary tone."
Wonder Wheel,Wonder Wheel isn't merely a bad movie but a laughable one.
Wonder Wheel,"Despite a stunning performance by Winslet and some beautiful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, Wonder Wheel loses its charms quickly and you'll soon be begging to get off this particular ride."
Wonder Wheel,"""Oh god, spare me the bad drama,"" a character in Woody Allen's ""Wonder Wheel"" implores. Would that we could be so fortunate."
Wonder Wheel,"For years, the writer-director has returned to the nostalgia-soaked New York of his youth. But in his latest - the turgid, inert Wonder Wheel - he's moving in place as lazily as the Coney Island Ferris wheel of the title."
Wonder Wheel,"""Wonder Wheel"" isn't one of Allen's worst, but it's definitely a third-tier effort."
Wonder Wheel,"Mr. Allen certainly keeps you busy with all these colors, tones, influences, complications, stereotypes and histrionics, but to little end."
Wonder Wheel,A Woody Allen disaster that elicits both a cocked head and a dropped jaw.
Wonder Wheel,"Though there are moments of brightness, the movie's a slog, with a central conceit that feels more like a sophomoric film school exercise than the work of an established writer-director."
Wonder Wheel,"Like that giant metaphorical carousel looming over them, it's a movie that's spinning its wheels."
Wonder Wheel,"The film is fine, romantically lit and beautifully shot (like many Allen films), but isn't nearly effective as, say, Allen's last great film--Blue Jasmine."
Wonder Wheel,"I'm not sure why we need a Coney Island that looks like Bertolucci's The Conformist, but somehow it works, providing a level of visual interest that fascinates even when the dramatic interest lags."
Wonder Wheel,"What's getting in the way is Allen's stilted, hoary script..."
Wonder Wheel,"Allen is, by all appearances, still filming first drafts, full of placeholder scenes and dialogue in sore need of polish, and releasing first cuts, full of narrative dead-ends and scenes that don't work."
Wonder Wheel,Woody Allen's latest is shallow and distancing despite its stunning craftsmanship.
Wonder Wheel,Perhaps it's that [Woody] Allen doesn't think people can really transcend anything ever. He doesn't have a tragic writer's temperament.
Wonder Wheel,"The tone throughout vacillates wildly from silly comedy to classic Hollywood melodrama, and all of it feels as artificial and unsatisfying as the cotton candy twirling in a vending cart."
Wonder Wheel,"A terrific, dark look at nostalgia."
Wonder Wheel,"Say what you want about the storyteller, but the stories speak for themselves, and Wonder Wheel proves they still have a lot to say."
Wonder Wheel,"Like Winslet's character, Allen is stuck in the past and Wonder Wheel is a crushing reminder of his present."
Wonder Wheel,"It's got movement and flow, it's got a vibrant sunset look of honky-tonk nostalgia, and it's got a bittersweet mood of lyrical despair that the film stays true to right up until the final note."
Wonder Wheel,"The warming affection that the director has bestowed on so many of his best characters is largely missing. In fact, he seems barely engaged."
Wonder Wheel,Too distant and remote from his characters to make them live for us or to make us care for them.
Wonder Wheel,"It's impossible to watch ""Wonder Wheel"" without letting Allen himself and the current response to Harvey Weinstein not color the (absolutely gorgeous) viewing experience."
All About Nina,Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a performance that is both fearless and nuanced...
All About Nina,"Always a likable actor, here Winstead is at a charismatic high, carrying a mediocre film, making it impossible to turn off through her star power alone."
All About Nina,"Mostly, Vives' work is a series of punch lines that feel more like gut punches - a relentless challenge that Winstead handles with seeming ease."
All About Nina,"Nina lays everything on the line, and in telling her story, Vives does too."
All About Nina,"Everything hinges on Vives' direction, but it is Winstead who carries the entire movie. She is voracious in her humanity, but also extremely skillful in redressing her flaws into her routine."
All About Nina,Nina's Bjork and her Kristen Stewart are pretty good - but her impression of Werner Herzog is fantastically weird. And simply fantastic.
All About Nina,"Despite a lively performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Nina is a big bore with a small talent and a one-track mind."
All About Nina,"Vives' filmmaking is confident, threading the needle on some emotionally complex scenes, but the film works because of Winstead's bravura performance, taking Nina to a place of raw, deep emotional honesty."
All About Nina,A striking and at times uncomfortably personal feature debut from writer-director Eva Vives that makes good on its title by not shying away from the emotional damage that makes its protagonist so compelling.
All About Nina,It's messy and raw and true.
All About Nina,"""An excellent entry in the romantic comedy format that doesn't lose sight of who its heroine is the moment she falls for someone."""
All About Nina,"The movie is carried by Winstead's mesmerizingly mercurial performance, and not just because she does pitch-perfect impressions of, among others, Kristen Stewart and Werner Herzog."
All About Nina,"Ms. Winstead is so good that she even shows you the movie that could have been, one without the clichés and therapy talk."
All About Nina,"Right out of the gate, the film only sees a kind of blunt irony in this blurring of her public and private selves."
All About Nina,"If you liked Ladybird, you'll love this far more adult and bitterly sarcastic feminist tale."
All About Nina,"Balancing its darker moments with humor and warmth, the picture has a broad enough appeal to - finally, movie gods? - get Winstead onto the first-choice lists of top-tier filmmakers."
All About Nina,"Though the material isn't quite ready for prime time, Winstead once again proves herself a major player."
Mary Shelley,"Elle Fanning's performance illuminates this story of passion, imagination, and fierce independence."
Mary Shelley,"The movie, which gradually slows to a crawl, could have used a little galvanism itself."
Mary Shelley,"The movie is still well executed but, at two hours, not even Fanning's persuasive performance can elevate it to being more than a moderately interesting historical drama."
Mary Shelley,"If it falls short of its ambitions, you have to love that it tries to go for the big story, and that it gives Elle Fanning such a grand role at her tender age."
Mary Shelley,"The Shelleys are cut from the CW world, or from another bad Douglas Booth-starring literary film, 2013's Romeo and Juliet."
Mary Shelley,"Unfortunately the film lacks any singular slant. It fills in details about Mary's life, but there's never any sense of a thesis being advanced."
Mary Shelley,"While it feels stretched at two hours, its teen-movie digressions work well as opportunities to apply contemporary feminist critiques to the Romantics."
Mary Shelley,"Most of all the film is a tribute to its brave and uncompromising women, Shelley and Al-Mansour."
Mary Shelley,Fanning holds the screen as someone intent on writing her own destiny.
Mary Shelley,"Mary Shelley is an intelligent, probing, well-acted biopic with a strong feminist slant."
Mary Shelley,"It's a story of super-heroism in disguise from the early 19th century, in a mostly London-set literary milieu that's captured with curious and probing compassion."
Mary Shelley,"The story is all blood, sex, lust, love and death but director Haifaa al-Mansour's period drama is just too pretty and polite."
Mary Shelley,"Every personage passes before us, conscientiously researched, quacking their literalistic dialogue, while the camera shoots them. Dead, in some cases."
Mary Shelley,"A disappointingly straightforward, romance-driven take on a fascinating story of creation, but one that's lifted by a superb central performance by Elle Fanning."
Mary Shelley,"Ironically, this story about the sources of inspiration is empty of just that: inspiration."
Mary Shelley,"The film, though handsome and well-acted, reduces Mary Shelley's accomplishments; it's almost over by the time ""Frankenstein"" gets written, with little attention paid to its author's creative spark."
Mary Shelley,"As it stands, this monstrously inept creation is more terrifying than any scenario the author conjured up."
Mary Shelley,"To make boring the revelries of 19th century literati is no mean feat, but it is ""Mary Shelley's"" chief accomplishment."
Mary Shelley,There's nothing internal about Fanning's performance to suggest that Mary is an artist with something she needs to say and that must be said.
Mary Shelley,"Mary Shelley is a dull, tame and disappointingly conventional biopic that almost never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity."
Mary Shelley,"The director and her star make their point under the meticulously appointed cover of the film's 18th-century setting, but they make it plainly, cleanly, and with fire."
Mary Shelley,"Respectable, but dull and tedious."
Mary Shelley,"Mary Shelley wants to be a film about artistic creation and female liberation. And, to a degree, it is. But it's so flat and poorly paced that it just feels like a squandered opportunity of monstrous proportions."
Mary Shelley,It's a deeply conventional movie about ragingly unconventional people.
Mary Shelley,"Don't expect anyone to shout, 'It's alive!' as they depart the theater."
Mary Shelley,"Celebrates Mary Shelley for the trailblazing woman that she is, but hews far too close to convention to truly represent her life."
Mary Shelley,"Viewers may initially find Fanning's American-girl presence jarring, but she holds her own - and her accent. By the movie's end, her performance has come to seem as authentic as anything else in this perfumed account."
Mary Shelley,"Its de-complicated characters and conflicts don't tell us anything about what it meant to live in a time or to make something-only the vague order in which some important things happened, the result like rushed homework."
Mary Shelley,"Handsomely produced but as dramatically inert as a high school oral book report, giving audiences the gist of the Frankenstein author's story but never, ironically, bringing her to life."
Mary Shelley,"Nothing about it is inspired, save some of Sturridge's Byronic mood swings."
Mary Shelley,Elle Fanning as Mary Shelley is the movie's only real grace. She has been given a poor script to inhabit.
Mary Shelley,"A reminder that England in the early 19th century remains a rich repository of stories and characters, and era that can be made to feel charmingly quaint and bracingly modern, on both the page and the screen."
Mary Shelley,"A long way from the finesse-and the feminist vigor-that the director, Haifaa Al-Mansour, displayed in her début feature, ""Wadjda"" (2012)."
Mary Shelley,Al-Mansour seems a perfect fit for the material that is Shelley's life. But there's no life here! What Mary Shelley needed was a jolt of energy.
Mary Shelley,"It boggles the mind that anyone would try to make something mannered from her wild, sad, huge life...a dismal book report that the author herself would have declared fusty."
Mary Shelley,"A welcome showcase for the considerable talents of Elle Fanning, who deftly shades the trials and tribulations of the young writer and her complicated relationship with Percy Shelley"
Mary Shelley,"For a film that chronicles the rise of a creator obsessed with reanimating the dead, ""Mary Shelley"" is utterly lifeless."
Mary Shelley,"Elle Fanning's central performance adds needed weight, but all around her the tone is bizarre and the performances hammy."
Mary Shelley,"Mary Shelley is a diverting enough biopic that features decent performances through an often vivid lens, but given the unusual facts of the author's life, a far more offbeat and far less rigid film could have been made here."
Mary Shelley,"It's somewhat amusing - especially Tom Sturridge, who turns Lord Byron into poetry's version of Jack Sparrow - but immediately forgettable."
Mary Shelley,"In its final act, the film abandons its fruitful investigation of belief systems in favor of a simplistic articulation of Mary's inspiration."
Mary Shelley,"Impressively shot and suffused with a righteous feminist fire, the film is undercut by a confused and clunky script and a fundamental lack of thematic focus, turning an extraordinary story into didactic and disjointed melodrama."
Mary Shelley,A passionate film about a woman's ideas.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",It's a brilliant performance in a film that's an honorable misstep.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","There's an interesting drama in there, but it has not been given time to fight its way out of the semi-digested mulch all around."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","We don't learn very much about Israel's relationships or motivations from the screenplay, but it's fascinating to watch Washington's display of repressed turmoil."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","The results are entertaining and watchable, but always slightly, oddly out of sync with the eponymous turn."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","A Washington vehicle in the purest sense, one whose whole reason for being is the fact that he's in it."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Through his sheer learned technique and presence, Washington sells this one."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",It ends in a very unsatisfactory way but that doesn't take away from the mercurial originality of Washington's performance.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Clearly conceived as a morality play, the awkwardly titled film is too contrived and predictable to efficiently deliver the emotional punch it aims for."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",Like a Perry Mason episode that has accidentally collided with Philadelphia.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",[Denzel] Washington is perfectly good but the script doesn't give him enough to make this worthy of all the attention.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","A worthy but wordy look at the inequities of the US legal system, saved by a handful of terrific scenes and a tour-de-force turn from Washington."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",One of the best performances of Washington's career.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Roman J. Isreal, Esq. isn't just a narrative about how three weeks can dramatically change your life, it's a tale about the things we tell ourselves and how desire and excess can seduce even the most humble among us."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",It's a credit to Washington's rock solid performance that we care as much as we do.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","... the weird thing is, as gripping as all of this is in concept, in execution it's oddly dull."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Part character study, part legal thriller and part morality tale about means manifesting their own ends, ""Roman J. Israel, Esq."" winds up being just as eccentric and unpredictable as its doggedly honorable, and far from perfect, leading man."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",You can't stop watching [Washington] - and you can't stop wishing he didn't have to work so hard to keep the story together once it starts branching out in different directions.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","What's even harder to take seriously is the film's late shift into genre territory, which includes the most shameless and unnecessary car chase I've seen in a long time."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Roman J. Israel, Esq. has pockets of intrigue, and writer-director Gilroy and Washington have teamed up to create a promising dramatic character. We just never get full delivery on that promise."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","The story is surprisingly unfocused and, when it snaps out of the protracted setup phase, it plunges into quasi-thriller territory that relies on a series of hard-to-swallow contrivances."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","What a treat it is to see this great actor, after almost 40 years in movies, give a performance that feels both utterly unexpected and completely true."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",An uneven movie elevated by Denzel Washington's distinctive performance.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",Washington turns this seemingly unsympathetic character into a figure to embrace on the screen and to remember at awards time - the actor once again courts serious consideration at the Oscars.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Watching ""Roman J. Israel, Esq."" is like watching a very long episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" only without the laughs, and without a lead character who even knows that he's annoying."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","You're left with another Denzel Washington performance that gets under your skin and stays there, rankling away. That's a lot more than most movies offer - even the better ones."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Written and directed by Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler), this affecting suspense film has been compared to the excellent Michael Clayton (by his brother, writer-director Tony Gilroy), though Roman is more eccentric."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Roman J. Israel, Esq. is one brilliant performance in search of a movie."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Despite Washington's best efforts, Roman J. Israel, Esq. feels like it was named after the wrong character."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","The movie can't bring itself to push its central iceberg of a character into hotter water -- which is too bad, because that's exactly where Washington thrives."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Even when the movie loses its way narratively, Washington's in there, slugging, building a living, breathing character out of Gilroy's knight-errant."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","With his hunched gait, lack of people skills, and idealism built on quicksand, Washington makes you believe in Roman 100 percent."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",Washington's performance as Israel is quirky and charming enough to almost pull it off.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Washington gives one of his rare bad performances here, turning Roman into an improv sketch filled with tics, mannerisms and an overreliance on his attire."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Washington's quirky performance shines brightly, but in a movie that otherwise doesn't present an especially strong case for rushing out to see it."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Whatever faults you find in Roman J. Israel, Esq as a movie - it tends to meander - there is no disputing the start-to-finish excellence of Denzel Washington in the title role."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","What's interesting about Roman J. Israel, Esq.... is that what doesn't work about it is exactly what did work about Gilroy's earlier film, which was one of my favorites of 2014."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","For an actor whose powerful presence usually slaps you in the face, that's one helluva stunning transformation."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Though the film is completely worth seeing just to experience such a totally realized performance and hear Gilroy's always sharp dialogue, the reality and complexity of the character turns out to clash with plotting that is not as convincing."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","An unlikely melodrama of temptation, downfall and redemption."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Either Roman is too pure for the world of this movie or he is not. Mr. Gilroy, perhaps similarly caught between integrity and commercial calculation, gets as lost as his hero."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","To be fair to Denzel, who tends to be reliably commanding even when slumming it in commercial crap, it's hard to imagine anyone doing wonders with this particular title role."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","We spend lots of time watching this guy be disappointed and disappointing, with too many dead stretches in which we can wonder when the plot's shoes will finally start dropping."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Denzel Washington, a movie star for a reason, fails to sell himself as a socially awkward introvert and self-proclaimed ""man behind the curtain."""
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Washington gives us another astounding performance of a deeply idiosyncratic man, but the film around him often isn't as skillful, meandering in places and gradually becoming more like a lot of other films."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",[Denzel] Washington tops himself as the title character.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Throughout the film, a promising character study is smothered beneath lazy genre machinations."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Washington crafts an eccentric yet engaging performance, but in tuning the movie to the key of an unconventional and, in many ways, unbendable leading character, Gilroy can't quite find the story's rhythm."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",Denzel Washington may be the most accomplished actor of our generation.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","A rare bad performance from Denzel Washington sinks Roman J. Israel, Esq., writer-director Dan Gilroy's follow-up to 2014's Nightcrawler."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Writer/director Gilroy makes considered points about recent Black activism, its different variations and the contradictions between them but he throws it all into a confused mix that is so frustrating to follow and never emotionally engaging."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",This is a formula movie but Gilroy is no hack. He hits the expected beats but with more color and depth than you expect.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","But the movie comes up short of generating the same passion that keeps Roman going - and when he starts losing faith in his mission, the movie follows suit."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",[Washington is] the best part of a clunky crowd-pleaser that bills itself as a dramatic thriller but isn't really that.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",Denzel Washington gives a terrifically off-kilter performance in this fascinating and flawed character study that frustratingly can't meld all its ambitions into a coherent and satisfying whole.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",It's not a role we're used to seeing Washington play... but he's never been better.
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Unfortunately, something at the center just doesn't hold, and it flies apart over the course of 133 minutes into confusing shards of plot, legalese-heavy monologues and ... a touch of soggy sentimentality in the home stretch."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Its depiction of weary activism, both lost and renewed, is well-suited to our dark times."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Roman is a fantastic character, and Washington's high-wire performance is one of his most daring and compelling."
Love After Love,"What could make for a captivating story involving a transgressive love triangle is, even on a micro level, ineffective."
Love After Love,A hushed but gorgeous melodrama.
Love After Love,"""Love After Love"" goes through the motions of classic, rousing melodrama but not the emotions."
The Young Karl Marx,"August Diehl... invests the twentysomething Marx with a quick mind and a feverish impatience that propel the narrative forward, his energy a real asset to a film that trades heavily in ideas."
The Young Karl Marx,"Peck's work is handsome; what it lacks is a true sense of danger, a feeling of history roiling in the present tense."
The Young Karl Marx,Kolja Brandt's cinematography makes a modest production budget look lavish.
The Young Karl Marx,"There are no memorable shots in the film and Peck seldom attempts to tell the story, or at least exemplify its themes, through visual means. It actually looks a lot like it was made to be consumed on television."
The Young Karl Marx,One may conclude Raoul Peck's biopic is so absorbing because Marx's ideas remain so full of fire and so alive.
The Young Karl Marx,"With the sensibility of a very boring Downton Abbey and a political consciousness to match, The Young Marx is an insipid disaster."
The Young Karl Marx,"And by the time Marx writes what his wife calls a...critique of the critical critique - well, my eyes glazing over at the dialectics, I for one needed an antidote."
The Young Karl Marx,"Watching it is like being tossed into an agitprop blender..It has little depth, either political or psychological."
The Young Karl Marx,Raoul Peck is on a roll.
The Young Karl Marx,"Against all expectations, ""Young Karl Marx"" makes this kind of brainy content bracing and dramatic."
The Young Karl Marx,Both intellectually serious and engagingly free-spirited.
The Young Karl Marx,"From its lifelessly anachronistic English dialogue to its Masterpiece Theatre lighting and production design, The Young Karl Marx tries to filter radical thought through the pace and aesthetics of a middlebrow drama."
The Young Karl Marx,"Its story concerns the development of communist theory, but in its construction it harks back to Eli Whitney's theory of interchangeable parts."
The Young Karl Marx,"The movie's plush, cozy aesthetic and unintentionally funny melodrama are at odds with its subjects: revolt, theory, originality, and observation."
The Young Karl Marx,"The film is ironically gripped by the sort of ideological ""vagueness"" that Karl Marx dismisses throughout."
The Young Karl Marx,"It should be dull, but it isn't. Somehow the spectacle of fiercely angry people talking about ideas becomes absorbing and even gripping."
The Young Karl Marx,"It's dutiful, but it's also superficial and polite, and it commits the genteel sin of the old biopics: It turns its hero into a plaster saint."
The Young Karl Marx,At once historically impeccable and a filmic disappointment.
Journey’s End,"Director Saul Dibb doesn't quite succeed in making the drama feel fresh, but this is a sensitive and handsomely performed adaptation."
Journey’s End,"If it's not pacifist, it's certainly a profoundly anti-war statement about men under ultimate stress. One hundred years on, it's never too soon, never too late for that idea."
Journey’s End,Journey's End is a powerful and moving tribute to the men who fought in the trenches.
Journey’s End,Harrowing and heartbreaking.
Journey’s End,Journey's End is dependent upon the change that comes to the psyche when one's life is literally ticking away.
Journey’s End,"Its cerebral message boils down to a ""war is hell"" theme, a sentiment that's been conveyed more effectively in countless other works. It's a journey that mostly retraces steps."
Journey’s End,"Lugubrious and anticlimactic, inadequate testimonial to those slaughtered in this pointless battle, and the million more who would die before the war's end."
Journey’s End,"There's a heavy-handed and dated feeling about this version of ""Journey's End"" - it never really breaks loose from its theatrical origin."
Journey’s End,The actors are superb at impressing some humanity onto this ugliness.
Journey’s End,War is hell but we've seen that story before. Journey's End manages to reaffirm the message in a tale that is both harrowing and heartbreaking.
Journey’s End,What does a movie based on a 90-year-old play about World War I have to say to contemporary audiences? Plenty.
Journey’s End,"This taut, emotionally wrenching snapshot of both the mythologies and grim realities of war possesses useful reminders about self-deception and abuse of power, especially at a time when bellicose rhetoric and war cabinets seem to be the order of the day."
Journey’s End,Nothing happens and everybody talks incessantly.
Journey’s End,"Saul Dibb's World War 1 tale of British soldiers in the trenches is a bleak, sobering experience that puts audiences through a wringer. It's also an emotional powerhouse you will not forget."
Journey’s End,"Journey's End does justice both to the horrors of war and to the spirit that can sometimes, somehow, transcend it."
Journey’s End,"An intelligent, meticulously crafted drama about British soldiers in the trenches of World War I."
Journey’s End,"Antiwar films don't have to be great to be worthy; this one is very, very good."
Journey’s End,"This new film doesn't have a particularly new take on the material. It's Journey's End, told again, and told quite well. So whether or not it will astound you has a lot to do with how familiar you are with the source material."
Journey’s End,"For a movie based on 90-year-old source material, ""Journey's End"" works remarkably well."
Journey’s End,A rattling sound design and the cinematographer Laurie Rose's excellent use of low light aren't enough to make the experience immediate.
Journey’s End,"Though set at a specific moment in time, the film could be about terminal cancer patients or condemned prisoners, a deeply felt catalog of the behaviors of men who know they're about to die."
Journey’s End,"Is there any artistically compelling reason for the existence of the latest adaptation... Not really, but it's a good play, once again providing juicy roles to fresh and established talent. That'll suffice."
Journey’s End,Director Saul Dibb has infused his adaptation of R.C. Sherriff's play with a striking sense of urgency.
Journey’s End,"Journey's End is charged with electricity: I have rarely seen a war film that conveys so powerfully the pained tenderness of comrades, and the insidious creep of fear."
Journey’s End,"Blackadder Goes Forth plays very much like a comic version of the same yarn. It is, nonetheless, worth allowing the old warhorse one more circuit of the track."
Journey’s End,"Sam Claflin is particularly good as the boozy, brooding Captain Stanhope, whose intensity, belligerence and self-loathing flesh out what might in less capable hands have been a cliched, shell-shocked soldier."
Journey’s End,"Think of it as a really, really, little gem."
Journey’s End,"The first world war is one of the 20th century's oldest, grimmest tales of futility and slaughter. Dibb and his excellent cast put new passion into it."
Journey’s End,It's exactly the film you think it's going to be - for better and for worse.
Journey’s End,This version of Journey's End may not offer any new perspectives into its subject matter but it is made with a commitment and intensity that stop it from ever seeming old fashioned.
Journey’s End,Director Saul Dibb (Bullet Boy) brings a tense immediacy to this stagey chamber piece.
Journey’s End,"An outstanding cast savours performing a play that has stood the test of time. Avoiding sentimentality, this is a valuable rejoinder to those who would sugar-coat mass slaughter."
Journey’s End,"Dibb's film at times feels of a piece with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, from the oppressive immediacy of the camerawork to the heavy, droning soundtrack."
Journey’s End,This Journey's End is still a stage play filmed. But it could hardly be filmed better.
Journey’s End,"If there's something holiday-schoolwork-ish about it - very decent, not quite urgent - some wonderfully acted moments carry the day."
Journey’s End,"A genuinely moving and thoroughly affecting piece of filmmaking, which tells a simple story with honesty and commendable reserve."
Journey’s End,"Few stage staples from 90 years ago would easily translate to the screen today, yet R.C. Sherriff's once near-ubiquitous ""Journey's End"" proves potent as ever in this sturdy new adaptation ..."
Journey’s End,"Keep calm and carry on, right past the marquee."
Only the Brave,"The fires themselves are frighteningly well staged, and by the film's conclusion the courage and dedication of these firemen has been amply demonstrated. It's a pity that the film that tells their story wasn't a little less clunky."
Only the Brave,It deserves credit for the way it tells a difficult story.
Only the Brave,The story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots deserves a better movie.
Only the Brave,"Only the Brave is the film-making equivalent of the plaid shirt and denim jeans favoured by the men for their off-duty attire. It's obvious, safe and as familiar as beer and banter."
Only the Brave,We are all biding macho time until the big one comes around. It eventually does arrive and the results are properly bone-shaking. Tougher than the rest.
Only the Brave,... a corny soup of macho clichs and empty theatrics...
Only the Brave,"A salt-of-the-earth tale that'll play well in red states, but offers little spark."
Only the Brave,"Its real subject, it soon turns out, is death, not survival."
Only the Brave,Kosinski's direction comes good for the harrowing climax.
Only the Brave,"Long, tedious and not much fun at all. The ending is good though."
Only the Brave,"Only the Brave feels like a film that would have made sense coming from Peter Berg or Michael Bay, but Kosinski mostly pulls back on the macho cheerleading to find something more objective, and ultimately, deeply emotional."
Only the Brave,"Though the movie, based on an article in GQ, by Sean Flynn, offers fascinating insights into the practical exertions and bureaucratic complications of firefighting, it places much greater emphasis on the protagonists' personal lives."
Only the Brave,"Although probably a little too long, the film succeeds in being both emotionally forceful and dramatically satisfying."
Only the Brave,"This is a seriously magnificent motion picture, one I'm almost certain to still be talking about as the year inches closer to its conclusion."
Only the Brave,"Only the Brave is essentially a war film, with brave commanders and earnest (and not so earnest) young men who love each other fighting a menacing and relentless enemy."
Only the Brave,"Although Only the Brave is a well-acted and well-made film with a gut-wrenching true story, the testosterone with which it defines itself is almost overwhelming."
Only the Brave,"The based-on-a-true-story Only the Brave is visually and narratively strong, but falters when it steps outside of a totally masculine zone."
Only the Brave,"Only the Brave is not a hollow Hollywood action movie: it's a tribute to a group of men, and their supportive women, who made a difference. Watching the film is a humbling and intensely moving experience."
Only the Brave,"Kosinski lets the story unfold at a measured pace - so much so that by the time we reach the climactic scene, we're unprepared for what unfolds. As a result, it's even more devastating and effective."
Only the Brave,"It's a movie intent on telling us the hotshots were heroes, without sufficiently dramatizing either their professional decisions or their private lives."
Only the Brave,"For a moment, we get to be a part of that group of hotshots, and it is piercingly sad to lose them."
Only the Brave,"Director Joseph Kosinski puts the brotherhood of the unit front and center, emphasizing the bonds forged over sweat and soot. He directs with a sense of duty to honor the crew, and he does the job."
Only the Brave,"While ""Only the Brave"" is consistently involving and entertaining, [its] desire to be accurate about a heroic reality proves to be an at times awkward fit with the conventions of this kind of earnest and old-fashioned Hollywood film."
Only the Brave,"The movie overall can feel more than a little formulaic, but as a tribute to real-life heroes, Only the Brave serves its purpose."
Only the Brave,"What goes down in Yarnell, and Kosinski's respectful portrayal of it, is undeniably devastating - and a well-deserved salute to a group of low-key heroes."
Only the Brave,"The cast as a whole, under the direction of Joseph Kosinski, brings gleeful energy to a group portrait of good souls in the American heartland, working one fire after another and living it up in between."
Only the Brave,"Director Joseph Kosinski makes effective use of the wide-screen frame (particularly in capturing the Arizona vistas), though he fails to build on any of the script's straightforward themes."
Only the Brave,"Take out the classic-rock soundtrack, and it could be a vintage Hollywood story of competence, camaraderie and derring-do; only its title feels generic."
Only the Brave,This is a job for real heroes. The reminder of their sacrifice could not come at a more opportune time.
Only the Brave,"Filled with male bonding and macho bravado, it's a polished, old-fashioned account of heroism, one whose familiar beats and episodic nature somewhat blunt its dramatic spark."
Only the Brave,It's rare to see such imaginative energy expended to tell the stories of 'ordinary' men.
Only the Brave,"This may not be a story of triumph, but it's inspiring nevertheless."
Only the Brave,"Josh Brolin has rarely been better than in this role as the team's leader, Eric Marsh."
Only the Brave,"Made with a combination of sincerity and technical skill that is effective on a fundamental level, even if it never quite becomes the devastating emotional experience that it clearly wants to be."
Only the Brave,"""Only the Brave"" gets better and better as it goes."
Only the Brave,"This absorbing film gets the message across without sensationalism, delivering a straightforward portrait of regular working men toiling at an uncommonly risky job."
Only the Brave,"Joseph Kosinski's Only the Brave displays a kinship to Howard Hawks's hard-nosed, old-fashioned pragmatism."
Only the Brave,"Only the Brave weaves together wholesome plot threads that will please mainstream crowds. But it is also boldly staged, with an inventive and informative approach to action filmmaking."
Only the Brave,"This film makes such firefighters into cartoons, which ill serves their legacy."
Only the Brave,"Through the ups and downs of training, a few moments of comedic relief and partying, detours into family drama, Only the Brave marches slowly and with increasing intensity."
Only the Brave,The majesty of these images is in service of the story and the people in it - a true-life tale that will grasp onto your heart and hold on long after the credits roll.
Only the Brave,"Under the direction of Joseph Kosinski, a large cast headed by Josh Brolin and Miles Teller bring great vitality and sensitivity to their performances."
Only the Brave,"In the face of human emotions, its craftsmanship turns workmanlike."
Only the Brave,"A full portrait of sometimes-flawed men doing extraordinary things - an approach that makes the film so moving, its effect so shattering."
Only the Brave,"The pacing is slow and deliberate. Director Joseph Kosinski knows that it takes time to build real relationships and feelings. When the story finally and inevitably leads to Yarnell Hill, in Arizona, the impact is devastating and hard to shake."
Only the Brave,"While aspects of the routine become mundane, it's the developing brotherhood amongst the men, and the sense of community around them, that ultimately strengthens this story."
Only the Brave,Only The Brave leaves a mark.
Only the Brave,"A gripping and powerfully emotional portrait of yee-haw heroism, pitting a squad of cocky, calendar-purty white dudes against an adversary with no creed or color, just an unquenchable appetite for destruction."
Only the Brave,An engaging account of a tragic real-life story.
Only the Brave,"Only the Brave is a visually splendid, spellbinding, and surreal movie that also happens to be an emotionally shattering, over-the-top ugly-cry for the ages."
Only the Brave,"A true-life drama with a sure sense of character and milieu, ""Only the Brave"" is a thoughtful, well-observed look at community, heroism and addiction."
Only the Brave,"Only the Brave breaks no fresh ground, but it's a quaint elegy almost exclusively designed to resurrect lives lost, to make the case for why they were worth living. At least on that level, it succeeds."
Only the Brave,"In an era where the words ""based on a true story"" can give seasoned filmgoers a sinking feeling, this is a film where the complications and messiness of reality add genuine heft to the drama."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Is it fair to ask someone to traumatise (or retraumatise) themselves for the sake of art? Rather boldly, it seems as though Decker is also asking the question of herself."
Madeline’s Madeline,"If for no other reason, see it now to be on the ground floor at the unveiling of a new star: Helena Howard."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Overwhelming at first, Madeline's Madeline only gains from repeat viewings."
Madeline’s Madeline,"The result can be exhausting - and exhilarating, Decker's approach splintered and unpredictable but slowly creating streams of narrative..."
Madeline’s Madeline,It's an immersive and exotic experience. Helena Howard is a revelation.
Madeline’s Madeline,This is cinema most fine.
Madeline’s Madeline,"One of the best films of the year, if also one of the hardest to initially get your head around."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Add another name to the list of talented and charismatic young actresses of color making auspicious debuts of late: Helena Howard, star of director and co-writer Josephine Decker's simultaneously attractive and repellent mindjob."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Decker stretches the medium, creating a film that is at once uncomfortable and brilliant in its examination of intellectual and emotional appropriation."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Decker's visually supple exploration may chase its tail in the second half, but at its best ""Madeline's Madeline"" shifts perspectives and power dynamics seamlessly."
Madeline’s Madeline,"If you dissect what has happened, and take her POV away, it's a far less charming narrative than it seems."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Letting the audience determine the meaning of her aesthetic choices, Decker shows little interest in creating meaning herself."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Madeline's Madeline is a fascinating, often astonishing experimental work that obliterates the traditional structure of coming-of-age movies, but despite how abstract things may get, the emotion driving it remains crystal-clear."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Note to filmmakers everywhere: If you want to depict emotional dissonance through relentlessly swirly cinematography, do it sparingly. If you do it for 90 minutes, as Decker does, the audience isn't stirred. It's queasy."
Madeline’s Madeline,Helena Howard makes a heart-stopping professional debut as Madeline caught between Molly Parker's manipulative acting teacher and Miranda July's differently manipulative mom.
Madeline’s Madeline,"One of the year's headiest, most dazzlingly assured moviegoing experiences."
Madeline’s Madeline,"In a long history of art about art that focuses on the forces of toxic masculinity, Madeline's Madeline is the rare film that examines toxic femininity with the same nuance."
Madeline’s Madeline,"""Madeline's Madeline"" mistakes intimacy for honesty, and it mis-assumes that audiences care nearly as much about the creative process as actors and directors do."
Madeline’s Madeline,Decker has real vision. It's exciting to imagine her turning it on something other than her own process.
Madeline’s Madeline,"By pushing to the edges of her own iconoclastic vision, director Josephine Decker touches on universal truths rarely found inside a multiplex."
Madeline’s Madeline,"It's a visceral experience... Some viewers may find it too nerve-jangling, and it's hard to blame them. But it's a must-see for risk-takers."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Writer-director Josephine Decker more than earns the label ""auteur,"" and all the connotations that come with it."
Madeline’s Madeline,Madeline's Madeline lacks the self-reflection needed to answer its own questions about authorship-its story doesn't quite belong to its protagonist.
Madeline’s Madeline,"The movie is at times deliberately off-putting. But it's anchored by a star-making turn from Helena Howard, who plays the fascinating, inscrutable figure at its center."
Madeline’s Madeline,"It's a superb piece of acting about acting, and a harbinger of great things to come in this young actor's future."
Madeline’s Madeline,"The film is anchored at every turn by newcomer Helena Howard's big, brash and brilliant lead performance."
Madeline’s Madeline,"In her screen debut, this electrifying ingénue is radiant with passion and pain, making every frame feel almost obscenely intimate."
Madeline’s Madeline,"If ""Madeline's Madeline"" is sometimes unconvincing and frequently unnerving, it is never uninteresting."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Decker captures the emotional caprices of her characters with thrilling immediacy, allowing her sociopolitical commentary to trickle in through background details."
Madeline’s Madeline,Madeline's Madeline is thrillingly confounding.
Madeline’s Madeline,"Josephine Decker is a unique and dazzling artist, most notably for her troubling and daring commitment to everything that drives her characters."
Madeline’s Madeline,"It's newcomer Helena Howard, as Madeline, who gives an utterly mesmerizing, star-making performance."
Madeline’s Madeline,"Anyone who has ever taken an acting class and witnessed the psychodramas brewed there will relate to this bubbling kettle of raw, unleashed emotions stirred up in shifting power grabs."
Madeline’s Madeline,"At once intimidatingly dense and breezily concise, uncompromisingly experimental and riotously entertaining."
Madeline’s Madeline,"[Helena Howard] is the center spectacle, and the movie plays like a fever dream inside her new, fascinating mind."
Madeline’s Madeline,"The narrative might be shattered, but the film's slipstream of emotion is powerful and inescapable."
Madeline’s Madeline,"A drama of furious disconnection, a cinematic gear-grinding of a working-class family of modest means who seem hardly at home in their own neighborhood and are relentlessly abraded by contact with the deceptively welcoming milieu of art."
Madeline’s Madeline,This is one of the boldest and most invigorating American films of the 21st century.
Little Pink House,Exquisite cinematography by Alexandre Lehmann is as important as Catherine Keener's powerful performance as Susette Kelo in evoking the power of home.
Little Pink House,"""Litte Pink House"" feels like it's only ever checking off the requisite moments of civic outrage, while failing to connect with viewers on a level that's deeper than the average made-for-TV issue-of-the-week movie."
Little Pink House,A workmanlike dramatization of a controversial Supreme Court decision that never quite makes a case for itself.
Little Pink House,"Little Pink House is not one of the great civil rights movies (it's no Loving or To Kill a Mockingbird), but its slow, steady charm never lets go of the fact that these are people's homes on the line."
Little Pink House,Keener's performance keeps the film grounded even as blunt scenes of the opposing camp's machinations flirt with soap opera villainy.
Little Pink House,"The cast works diligently, and Keener is scrappy but calm throughout, with a convincing naturalism as a woman with tremendous strength and a powerful belief in civil rights."
Little Pink House,The movie often seems to have a hard time making up its mind whether it wants to be The Insider or Mean Girls.
Little Pink House,"If the story's political and personal nuances have been a bit flattened in Balaker's script, keeping proceedings in a movie-of-the-week register, this ""Little Pink House"" nonetheless retains what property developers would call good bones."
Little Pink House,"Palely photographed and anchored by a quiet, rather weary performance from Ms. Keener, ""Little Pink House"" is a peculiarly enervated affair."
Little Pink House,"It's an entertaining movie; but to an extent it's also a public service, in that it persuades the audience to think about an issue it might never have previously considered."
Little Pink House,"Like Erin Brockovich for eminent domain, Little Pink House does well to explain the thorny legal issue at its center without getting bogged down in minutiae."
Little Pink House,The film is mostly a sobering dramatization of a true and controversial story in recent Connecticut history.
Little Pink House,"Little Pink House brings urgency to a fascinating, underexplored theme."
Borg vs McEnroe,"McEnroe, Faraut asserts, was ""a man who played on the edge of his senses."" His film brings that home."
Borg vs McEnroe,"A psychological portrait of competition, friendship and a complicated, temperamental prodigy, whose outbursts and lack of self-control threaten to derail what promises to be a fruitful athletic career."
Borg vs McEnroe,"""Borg vs. McEnroe"" is an anecdotally gratifying, psychologically nuanced, and dramatically agile character study of Borg, but, despite its extended depictions of a celebrated match, it's not a satisfying tennis movie at all."
Borg vs McEnroe,It's about damn time somebody made a movie outta these guys.
Borg vs McEnroe,"By the end, even the flaws become, if not entirely justifiable, then at least intelligible."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Danish documentarian Janus Metz-making his first feature, and working from a script by Ronnie Sandahl-feels the need to hold our hands and oversimplify these two titans of tennis."
Borg vs McEnroe,Recreation of a classic 1980 tennis showdown at Wimbledon is helped by stellar acting - and gives its formerly tempestuous star Shia LaBeouf a perfect comeback role.
Borg vs McEnroe,"an indelible portrait of these men and their unlikely, ineffable and ultimately, deeply emotional bond."
Borg vs McEnroe,"""Borg Vs. McEnroe"" is a smart study of two athletes eclipsing each other in the prime of their careers."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Borg vs McEnroe underscores the inherent drama in sports movies, while tapping into a nostalgia factor for a moment when tennis produced storied rivalries and never felt bigger."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Ably shot by Niels Thastum, the movie looks less frenetic than many others in its genre. But the story drags without much narrative tension, and by the end you just want the match to happen so there's some movement onscreen."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Smoothly crafted, satisfyingly earnest..."
Borg vs McEnroe,The movie's biggest revelation - at least it was a revelation to me - is just how alike these two men were beneath their outward personas.
Borg vs McEnroe,"The film's main fault is how it drags between matches, but there's enough here that most hardcore tennis fans will find enough to love."
Borg vs McEnroe,"LaBeouf is the best thing about the movie. He captures McEnroe's drive and his ""Super Brat"" side, which is easy enough for an actor of his skill, but also his pain, his need to please his father."
Borg vs McEnroe,"It's the devotion to that emotional truth that allows [Janus] Metz and cinematographer Niels Thastum to step back, avoiding any major visual tricks."
Borg vs McEnroe,"One of ""Borg vs. McEnroe's"" strongest elements is the growing realization on both sides that each man mirrors the other."
Borg vs McEnroe,"It's a compelling story with much to recommend it: fascinating details about both men, plus an agonizingly close final game that will bring your heart into your throat."
Borg vs McEnroe,The film - which is nowhere near as interesting as LaBeouf's performance - is hopelessly reductive about its subjects' psychology even as it mocks the press of 1980 for being reductive about its subjects' psychology.
Borg vs McEnroe,"An engaging feature-length response to the trivia question ""Who won the Wimbledon men's singles title in 1980?"""
Borg vs McEnroe,"This fabulous, moody film isn't your typical jock flick where bitter rivals compete to a crowning, sweaty end."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Even the depiction of how both men waver during the Wimbledon final, of Borg losing his cool while McEnroe avoids succumbing to petulance, fails to tie into the larger portrait of their rivalry."
Borg vs McEnroe,The casting is inspired.
Borg vs McEnroe,Hollywood bad boy Shia LaBeouf is perfect as former tennis bad boy John McEnroe. He slams in a career-best turn in what's otherwise a largely inert sports movie.
Borg vs McEnroe,The temptation in biographical drama to reduce the subjects to simple psychological flashpoints should be resisted by anyone hoping to operate on an artistic plane higher than the average TV movie.
Borg vs McEnroe,"The film works (for much of its running time, at least) because the myth being peddled is an appealing one."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Whether or not you know the outcome, this is a cracking watch."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Fails to turn its title characters into three-dimensional people, leaning into their public personas instead of sketching in the details that would make them feel genuine."
Borg vs McEnroe,"[Shia] LaBeouf makes McEnroe his own, while costar Sverrir Gudnason does a remarkable approximation of Borg, right down to his walk and hockey-derived backhand."
Borg vs McEnroe,Tennis in movies doesn't work. We know that.
Borg vs McEnroe,"The final match is an absolute nail-biter, reminding tennis fans how electric this sport can be."
Borg vs McEnroe,Borg McEnroe is informative and well-acted but also very predictable.
Borg vs McEnroe,"It doesn't have the dramatic smarts to lend either surprising tension or excitement to otherwise familiar events, or shed any new light on them."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Lights a subtle glow under Borg, simmering his troubled introspection with help from Sverrir Gudnason's well-acted and startling lookalike."
Borg vs McEnroe,"The combined effect of a corner-cutting script and superficial direction is that Gudnason comes off as a capable, photogenic doppelgänger - no more, no less."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Some decent impersonations, but tries too hard to make everything feel meaningful."
Borg vs McEnroe,A sports film with an arthouse sensibility. It benefits greatly from its chosen subject matter - two of the most remarkable characters in sporting history - but only manages to truly get under the skin of one of them.
Borg vs McEnroe,"It may be watchable fare boosted by two dedicated performances worthy of discussion, yet this sports biopic - unlike the showdown it builds towards - fails to feel like one for the ages."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Much like a long game of tennis, Borg/McEnroe is frustrating to watch - a case of missed opportunities, with rare flashes of brilliance, but a grand slam is never forthcoming."
Borg vs McEnroe,"What we're left with is a staid little movie that races around the court and rallies itself to exhaustion, a historical drama that enshrines the narrative underpinnings of all great sports stories without doing anything to upend them."
Borg vs McEnroe,"There's a remarkable feedback loop happening with LaBeouf and McEnroe, and the push-pull of likability/disgust is the best thing about this movie."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Game, set and almost a great movie."
Borg vs McEnroe,"It's a sports movie for masochistic, vainglorious athletes."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Though it never justifies the overblown Andre Agassi quote used as its preface (""every match is a life in miniature""), the picture certainly shows how a single match can be made to feel like the world depends on it."
Borg vs McEnroe,"A love-all crowdpleaser for the most part, more Borg than McEnroe thanks to an arresting performance from lookalike Sverrir Gudnason."
Borg vs McEnroe,"Playing tennis may not seem the best use of Shia LaBeouf's talents, but the star is terrific in a role that shrewdly plays off his controversial off-screen persona."
Borg vs McEnroe,"This tennis film feels like a two-hour baseline rally, and it's not just the rackets that are made of wood."
Meditation Park,"A bit too hammy at moments, Meditation Park is otherwise a complex film that hews with tenderness to Asian stereotypes in order to reflect back their often-obscured depths."
Skate Kitchen,"Moselle's style of filmmaking is so unobtrusive we almost forget Skate Kitchen is a movie and believe we are in the skate park, zooming up the ramps, executing tricky spins, and getting up after being knocked down."
Skate Kitchen,An evocative meditation on skateboarding culture and nascent womanhood.
Skate Kitchen,"At best, though, Skate Kitchen is less about trying to get anywhere or make sense of anything than it is about the casual joy of being young, free and immersed in the moment."
Skate Kitchen,I can't shake the inkling that it would've worked better as straight documentary.
Skate Kitchen,Moselle is famous for her documentary The Wolfpack. Skate Kitchen isn't quite a documentary but it's not exactly a drama either.
Skate Kitchen,"A minor-key coming-of-age triumph that manages to simultaneously be relatable and wildly distinctive. Will almost certainly have lapsed, adult skateboarders (unwisely) dusting down their decks."
Skate Kitchen,Skate Kitchen is a wonderfully lyrical and well-observed rites of passage story.
Skate Kitchen,Repeated dopey exchanges...are poorly delivered by bratty exhibitionists in a stagnant narrative.
Skate Kitchen,Authentic and dreamily shot - yet smartly edited - Skate Kitchen is the kind of movie you feel infinitely more hip just for watching.
Skate Kitchen,"If a breeze blowing through New York City decided to make a film, it would be Skate Kitchen. Nearly every moment here, of camerawork or character play, is wistfully, blissfully fluid."
Skate Kitchen,"Gives its audience a sense of the almost pastoral innocence of skateboarding, its devotion to nothing more or less than having fun: a subversive urban vocation that is devoted to the art of pleasure."
Skate Kitchen,A mobilising portrait of sisterhood and skate culture.
Skate Kitchen,Less a movie than a visually striking meditation on Being a Girl These Days.
Skate Kitchen,"Skate Kitchen feels like those final summer nights before school started again, aimless and sticky and wide-open and perfect because your friends were there. It's evocative and entrancing."
Skate Kitchen,"""Skate Kitchen"" conveys the simple, exhilarating thrill of daring to claim social space, and proceeding to occupy it, with defiance and ecstatic grace."
Skate Kitchen,"In Skate Kitchen, the kids come as they are, and they're wildly fascinating."
Skate Kitchen,I was impressed by the tonal and aesthetic balance that Crystal Moselle finds here.
Skate Kitchen,Moselle believes in the power of girls. The friendships through which Camille learns how to be loved become the anguish that breaks her heart and the forgiveness that humbly heals her.
Skate Kitchen,A touching ode to the rewards and challenges of female friendship...
Skate Kitchen,"It works in large part because of Vinberg's poignant and persuasive performance. When she speaks of escaping ""the loneliness you have even in a crowded room,"" it makes your heart ache."
Skate Kitchen,"Nina Moran is a standout as the queer Skate Kitchen badass: With her backward b-ball cap, loud surfer shirts, and long blond hair, she could've kickflipped into Moselle's movie directly from Stacy Peralta's four-wheeled, SoCal history lesson Dogtown."
Skate Kitchen,"The entire movie hangs like a varial kickflip on the strength its star. Vinberg is quiet, subdued, and affected when the situation demands."
Skate Kitchen,It's just one meaningless scene followed by another.
Skate Kitchen,The depiction of Camille's quest for freedom and identity feels narrow and constrained.
Skate Kitchen,"[Director Crystal Moselle] hangs out with, and eavesdrops on, her protagonists with a documentarian's eye for detail... Her intimate style deftly captures the end-of-the-world intensity of teenage relationships"
Skate Kitchen,Unlike the skaters -- always magnetic when they ollie and rail -- Moselle has only one move as a filmmaker: rhapsodic slo-mo and drony guitar rock on the soundtrack.
Skate Kitchen,The movie really cooks when it's hanging out with the girls and watching them carve out a space for themselves in a city that's indifferent or hostile towards them.
Skate Kitchen,"Moselle shoots downtown street scenes with passion and deep familiarity, setting the action to an infectious, raucous soundtrack (which made me feel about 100 years old for not knowing any of its tracks)."
Skate Kitchen,"""Skate Kitchen"" is unfailingly compassionate to, and genuinely appreciative of, the people it chronicles."
Skate Kitchen,Skate Kitchen falters whenever it starts to act like a movie instead of the observational slice of life that Moselle's so adept at capturing.
Skate Kitchen,"If you have a teenage girl in your life who's into skate culture, it just might be her new favorite movie."
Skate Kitchen,"The film is empathetic toward and clear-eyed about its young characters, even if the drama it constructs around them tends toward the superficial."
Skate Kitchen,"Skate Kitchen is elevated by the big-hearted spirit of beloved high-school-set films, except with something superior in its disposal than barren school hallways: New York City streets that pulsate with energy."
Skate Kitchen,"Although the film is not particularly resonant outside of its own myopic storytelling, it does beautifully observe this subculture with both raw and lyrical detail."
Skate Kitchen,"Skate Kitchen exists in a time when it's still not normalized for men to see women on skateboards, but the crystal clear coolness of Moselle's film proves they should get with the program."
Skate Kitchen,"... cool, fun tribute to a group of real-life skater teens."
Skate Kitchen,Skate Kitchen turns its subjects into a fascinating microcosm of American youth.
Skate Kitchen,"Celebrates the liberation and the sisterhood that comes with skateboarding, with a mostly refreshing take on how teen girls deal with parents, boys and each other."
Skate Kitchen,"Though hardly inattentive to the gender-specific themes here, Moselle and her cast never come down hard on them."
Skate Kitchen,"It is first and foremost an irresistible hangout movie, offering a thoroughly millennial, vérité spin on '80s skater classics like ""Thrashin'."""
What They Had,"Writer/director Elizabeth Chomko's first film is remarkably assured and beautifully performed, richly human, and deeply moving."
What They Had,Terrific performances and an authentic portrait of a heartbreaking illness mark the touching drama What They Had.
What They Had,"This middling snoozefest demonstrates that good performances, a plausible story line, and relatable emotional content are not enough to make a movie interesting."
What They Had,"It had moments of truth in it, but I didn't think that as a film it was particularly effective."
What They Had,"The script, inspired by Chomko's grandparents' marriage, throws up plenty of authentic-looking observations of life with Alzheimer's."
What They Had,An affecting drama propped up by unexpected and humanizing moments of comedy.
What They Had,"Too many characters, who all have problems that need solving, stretch the limits of the story and push it beyond its comfort zone. Nevertheless, when the family dynamics are going strong, What They Had is an ensemble piece that hits the bull's-eye."
What They Had,"The movie manages to avoid nearly every ""family dealing with illness"" cliché one could ever imagine."
What They Had,"There's an inherent longing in Elizabeth Chomko's stunning feature debut, What They Had."
What They Had,Blythe Danner does a remarkable job of conveying Ruth's irreversible path into total memory loss without turning her into a movie-of-the-week cliché.
What They Had,"You may feel as if you've seen this movie before: Ruth has Alzheimer's, her husband Burt is in denial and their grown children Nick and Bridget are at odds. But please, trust me, you haven't..."
What They Had,"What sets the film apart is the literate and insightful script by Elizabeth Chomko, who also directs, and a cast of stellar performers."
What They Had,"One of the year's best indie dramas, one that should hit home with a wide range of viewers sure to relate to the achingly authentic family dynamics on display."
What They Had,"The quality of the actors and emotional potency of the subject keep ""What They Had"" from being a completely wasted effort. But the script makes it a close call."
What They Had,"""What They Had"" is mostly talk... and loud, aggrieved talk that approximates the experiences of many families in this situation while rarely convincing us of what this family is experiencing."
What They Had,"It's an actors' feast, and a genuine calling card for Chomko, primarily an actress (a strong one) before ""What They Had,"" but now very much a writer-director coming into her own."
What They Had,What works best here comes between the movie's heavy opening and its lightweight conclusion.
What They Had,"""What They Had""... achieves a delicate balance of tone, finding the humor in the irrepressibly sad, the love in daily toil, the soul in a disease that seeks to obliterate it."
What They Had,"What They Had gracefully coasts on its patient observations of one family's dynamics, but once the third act hits, Elizabeth Chomko goes about neatly tidying up seemingly every loose end."
What They Had,"Yet the cast is exceptional, the performances are extraordinary, the writing and direction are heartfelt, and the film is, consequently, stirring, frequently funny and consistently affecting."
What They Had,"Chomko refreshes the formula with vividly grounded writing that never forces her actors to summarize where they've been, emotionally speaking, or where they're going."
What They Had,"This captivating family drama is anchored by actors-Hilary Swank, Michael Shannon, Blythe Danner, Robert Forster-who truly are as good as it gets. You laugh as much as you cry, which means you believe in the movie's truth."
What They Had,"What they Had is a pure actor driven film, equal parts stirring, heart breaking, and hilarious."
What They Had,"Though occasional bursts of spikiness suggest that Chomko has a more unexpected story to tell, the narrative beats of this one - even without its eye-rolling final shot - are audible well in advance of the end credits."
What They Had,"The real triumph is its refusal to descend into mawkishness, even when a third-act tragedy takes place. It's blunt and bold, just like its characters."
What They Had,"In the overcrowded field of indie dramas about intergenerational family struggles, What They Had feels inessential; it rarely rises to the level of its performances."
What They Had,"If it's a good cry you're after, What They Had will more than do the trick. I just wish that this particular tearjerker jerked its tears with something subtler than a crowbar."
What They Had,"Stellar performances by the entire cast, especially Shannon, give a window into a cautionary tale. Almost as riveting as Manchester by the Sea. Excellent in other ways."
What They Had,"It's your quintessential big screen dysfunctional family that teeters on cliche every now and then, but with an ensemble this strong, it's too easy to fall into step with them."
What They Had,"A family drama that seems so real you leave the theater feeling like you just flew back from seeing your parents, even if they're nothing like the parents portrayed in the film."
What They Had,An excellent cast (including Michael Shannon and Hillary Swank) hit the right notes in an evenly wrought family drama that rings true.
What They Had,"There's raw power in Chomko's writing, but so much scrupulousness and craft that you feel safe when the time comes to weep."
What They Had,"A deluxe ensemble cast and a judicious trickle of minor-key humor elevate debuting writer-director Elizabeth Chomko's intergenerational family drama, What They Had."
What They Had,"This satisfying drama provides excellent roles for a fine cast, particularly Michael Shannon, Hilary Swank and Robert Forster."
Kings,"This dud recreation of the 1992 L.A. riots traps Halle Berry and Daniel Craig and a piece of momentous, civil-rights history in a crazyquilt of random action, absurdist humor, bogus romance and questionable purpose."
Kings,"It's possible to appreciate the film for recognizing both the horror and the absurdity in its subjects...and for playing exclusively in those extreme registers, yet still come to the conclusion that it's is all bark, no bite."
Kings,Kings is clueless about its subject matter.
Kings,It seems like a missed opportunity to dramatize the lives of real people caught up in the aftermath of the violence.
Kings,"The English-language debut from the brilliant talent behind best foreign film picture nominee Mustang is a terribly uneven, borderline absurdist jumble that undercuts its own message again and again."
Kings,"Frustrating and tone-deaf, the movie remembers the L.A. riots as an absurd comedy."
Kings,"In tying its story to this particular moment in American history, the movie bites off more than it can coherently chew."
Kings,"Eschewing poeticism for an empty sense of prefab empathy, ""Kings"" is so determined to be hopeful that it forgets to be honest."
Kings,"For all its honorable intentions to address sensitive issues that still sting, Kings is an unconvincing tonal patchwork."
Kings,An unmediated jumble.
Kings,A baffling and frustrating disappointment.
Flower,Bin it in the same place you put your bouquet from Valentine's Day.
Flower,Deutch burns up the screen in ways that are so passionately multifaceted I was dumbstruck by all of the emotional nuances she was able to mine with such aggressively calming ease.
Flower,"Everyone here is simply a mismanaged thing to be moved around an isn't-that-shocking storyboard as needed. It's a shame, as Deutch shows real commitment to a role that demands the exact opposite ..."
Flower,"There isn't a single kernel of emotional truth to be found in ""Flower,"" a lamentable dark comedy that treats subjects such as teen suicide, pedophilia and drug use with the nuance of a jackhammer."
Flower,"As a starring vehicle for [Zoey] Deutch, Flower is an aromatic concoction, but as a thorny coming-of-age story the film's buds wither on the vine."
Flower,"Deutch's portrayal of Erica is truly impressive, giving us a fully fleshed character who's both vulnerable and remorseless."
Flower,"It feels like the work of indie filmmakers weaned on Todd Solondz movies, adopting all of the ugliness but none of the insight, without even shock value to show for it."
Flower,It's hard to see the point of it all.
Flower,"""Flower"" can't quite nail the necessary tone, aiming for dark, but missing the comedy."
Flower,"Flower is clearly not everyone's idea of a bouquet, but it's willing to take chances -- and push buttons. It's a film that reflects our times, even if it makes us uncomfortable to acknowledge it."
Flower,"If you could pour the worst tendencies of American independent cinema over the last twenty years into a gigantic soup tureen and let it simmer overnight, this film would be the unappetizing result."
Flower,"As icky a comedy as you're likely to see this year, Flower comes from an angry place - one that is clearly more concerned about sounding provocative and clever than having anything meaningful to say."
Flower,Max Winkler's darkly funny film is a daringly tricky coming-of-age tale that both loves and heals its imperfect characters.
Flower,"A film that's fake-transgressive: eager to shock, but never to the point where it causes any lasting discomfort or makes any disquieting insight."
Flower,"Mistaking provocation for insight, and failing to sell the presumed heroism of its cunning central character, the movie grows less involving with each step."
Flower,"Cruelly amoral and only marginally credible, ""Flower"" is nevertheless wildly entertaining and at times even touching."
Flower,"In an age when so many teen movies are grasping so desperately for message-y topicality, it does the impossible, and manages to be about nothing at all."
Flower,"A collection of great performances, led by a truly exceptional one, in search of a script that's worthy of them."
Flower,"Flower is a sentimental work of faux nihilism, pandering to children who're just discovering alienation."
Flower,"[Zoey Deutch] carries the film, appearing in every scene, and gives an injection of gritty reality to a character who could otherwise have felt like a stand-in for the sexually curious millennial woman."
Flower,"Even when the movie ends, we feel like we're only scratching the surface. Still, how refreshing to see a coming-of-age story that's less concerned about a teen losing her innocence than it is in how she might earn some of it back."
Flower,"It is that rare commodity in today's superhero-driven cinema, and unless I'm forgetting something, one has to go back as far as Igby Goes Down to find an honest, brave, and bracingly comic look at adolescence such as this."
Flower,Flower is a dark comedy with touches of Bonnie and Clyde towards the end and definitely deserves your consideration.
Flower,"It's full of great lines and small pleasures, particularly the performances, including yet another layered and memorable Kathryn Hahn turn."
Flower,"Flower is redeemed only by Zoey Deutch's magnetic performance, which would be star-making if in the service of a better vehicle."
Flower,"Becomes slightly more bearable when it tries to be serious after failing so badly to be hip and funny, but embedded within the later dramatic scenes are desperately dumb plot decisions that lead us to a calamitous ending."
Shine,It's disappointing when the electrifying dance numbers are jettisoned for the lackluster story.
Shine,"The salsa scenes are the main draw here, and while the camerawork is unremarkable - zoom in, then pull back, then repeat - the energy stays high."
We The Animals,One of the discoveries of the year so far.
We The Animals,It deals with difficult subject matter with extreme grace.
We The Animals,"While the child actors are often excellent, they don't get much to say, and it's asking a lot for boys of primary-school age to express soulful depths through glances alone."
We The Animals,"It is a thing of beauty: too beautiful perhaps, running a real danger of prettifying poverty."
We The Animals,"This movie is so gorgeous, it even makes drone footage look ethereal rather than pedestrian."
We The Animals,"There's a heavy dose of pathos, though the film isn't without its moments of levity. And while the narrative is fragmented, like a memory, by the end there's a seismic shift: And that's something like evolution."
We The Animals,"The conclusion is certain enough to be practically foregone, and if what leads up to it is aggressively arty, it's also artful and frank, a rare combination."
We The Animals,Zagar builds a world that is simultaneously deeply authentic and dreamlike - the perfect combination to express a child's deeply felt but inherently distorted view of the universe he inhabits.
We The Animals,One of the best of the year so far.
We The Animals,The movie is all nuance and it continually wafts away into artiness.
We The Animals,"[A] stunning, semi-impressionistic film..."
We The Animals,"Every once in a while a movie grabs you, unsuspecting, and hustles its way into your heart. Jeremiah Zagar's ""We the Animals"" does that."
We The Animals,A lot is told wordlessly very efficiently.
We The Animals,"The movie doesn't tell you things, it just sort of leaves it to you to infer them from what the kids see."
We The Animals,Any potential sentimentality is obliterated by the film's tone and by the performances. It works best when it's most impressionistic.
We The Animals,"Zagar has smartly decided to tell this very subjective story of childhood with an Expressionist visual style that favors saturated colors, and he often leans on an unusually potent sound design that leads us seamlessly from one memory to the next."
We The Animals,"For his first narrative feature, the documentarian Zagar displays a thrillingly sensitive eye for the curiosity and caution that exists in every young child's heart, and how it is so simple for the world to crush that."
We The Animals,Somehow... Zagar has found a way to let the film's scenes surface and recede the way memories do.
We The Animals,"""We the Animals"" unfolds almost as a dream, albeit one that never shies away from the often hopeless reality of what it's like to grow up poor in America."
We The Animals,"On one level... ""We the Animals"" is a classic coming-of age tale; on another, it's a near perfect depiction of the emotional damage that can result from economic insecurity."
We The Animals,Zagar seems to lack a coherent directorial perspective on Torres' story; he mistakes vérité-style handheld and frequent close-ups (mostly captured with wide-angle lenses) for genuine intimacy and engagement.
We The Animals,"Zagar is a documentarian at heart, and it shows: The film is a closely, compassionately observed study of a boyhood that's otherwise largely unsupervised."
We The Animals,"An impressionistic swirl of a film about masculinity, about abuse, about growing up queer, about chaotic family life, about the jumble of incidents and stirrings through which a child discovers a self."
We The Animals,"In We the Animals, director Jeremiah Zagar sustains a tone of wounded nostalgia, fashioning a formalism that appears to exist simultaneously in the past and present."
We The Animals,"Zagar has an eye for simple yet loaded compositions, crafting potent imagery that tells us what his characters are afraid to say aloud, and his actors turn in unaffected yet unforgettable performances."
We The Animals,"Adapting Justin Torres' autobiographical novel, Jerimiah Zagar crafts a haunting, singular coming-of-age story."
We The Animals,"Jeremiah Zagar's dreamy coming of age film, based on Justin Torres' semi-autobiographical novel, casts a hypnotic spell."
We The Animals,"The film never recovers from the irritating tonal shifts, even with the good performances."
We The Animals,"Zagar has a gift for capturing a character's essence in an image or two, via simple compositions occasionally augmented by spellbinding snatches of animation. And he imbues the entire enterprise with a fascinating feeling of maybe-memory."
We The Animals,"We the Animals is a tiny film but mesmerizing in its own loose, dreamy way; it's also a distinctive take on the discovery of queer identity."
We The Animals,"In every scene, We the Animals evokes not only the specificity of that world but the deep-seated challenges of escaping it."
The Children Act,Emma Thompson once again proves she's our finest actress working today. The power of the film is diluted slightly by an insistence of adherence to the source but the fine performances shine through.
The Children Act,"This is a film that poses important moral and legal questions, but it's also a personal story in which a diligent woman, who regularly faces intense criticism, has to confront several deeply troubling personal problems."
The Children Act,"The Children Act is a mature and thoughtful film that is, above all, a wonderful showcase for a brilliant Emma Thompson."
The Children Act,"Thompson goes along with it as best as she can, but it's hard to watch this shift when we haven't been given any believable reason why Maye would fall for Adam's adolescent courtship and love poems."
The Children Act,"Emma Thompson is quietly devastating in The Children Act, an Ian McEwan film that is only kind of emotionally manipulative."
The Children Act,[Thompson] is so good that she overwhelms the story's shortcomings.
The Children Act,"Thompson and Whitehead shine, and director Richard Eyre has crafted a highly textured, respectable film about grown-up issues."
The Children Act,"The Children Act leaves you not only wanting more, but ready to binge it."
The Children Act,"""The Children Act"" isn't all that interesting a movie, despite the many talented people involved and the generally high level of work they do."
The Children Act,"""The Children Act"" feels utterly of a piece with the original book: urbane, understated, handsomely realized and impeccably interpreted by a cast of superb actors."
The Children Act,"This film adaptation never reaches the intimate heights of Ian McEwan's novel, but Emma Thompson's portrait of a family court judge who lets the world in at the cost of losing her own judgment is acting of the highest order."
The Children Act,Thompson has incredible chemistry with Tucci and also shares a couple of staggeringly intimate moments with young Whitehead that brought tears to my eyes. She is the reason to watch this movie.
The Children Act,"As mature as movies get, the elegantly costumed and designed The Children Act is a welcome getaway from the now-fading summer's loud fare."
The Children Act,"Equally comfortable on both stage and screen, Emma Thompson brings an added value to the mix that literally saves the film and keeps the viewer awake."
The Children Act,"Characters move through their posh habitats, explaining what they've done, are about to do, should have done years ago. Their confusion is fine; the fuzziness of the filmmaking less so."
The Children Act,The Children Act stages the clumsiness of belated domestic confrontations with the very coldness that's kept its characters from having discussed their emotions for decades and from having had sex for almost a year.
The Children Act,It's always rewarding to watch Thompson bring her lucid wit and deep emotional reserves to bear on a meaty role.
The Children Act,No one gives better pensive gaze here than Thompson; the drama lies in the fallibility of even the most competent and well-intentioned among us.
The Children Act,A beautifully internalized performance from Ms. Thompson and the various efforts to highlight the cinematic potential in Fiona's anguish... can't override the tidy ironies of Mr. McEwan's design.
The Children Act,"It's worth seeing precisely for the heat of the arguments that you can enjoy after the screening and, above all, for Emma Thompson."
The Children Act,"The pale, sharp-featured Whitehead brings an appropriately feverish intensity to Adam, who looks less like a typical 21st-century teenager than Lord Byron with a backpack."
The Children Act,"The film thinks itself very grown-up and, like many films that think themselves that, plays out its confrontations in the style of a middlebrow play."
The Children Act,"File this under missed opportunity. More often than not, it feels like a pretentious episode of Holby City. Or a shallow take on John Huston's The Dead."
The Children Act,A film that manages to be both wholly persuasive and utterly preposterous.
The Children Act,"Thompson remains the still focus of the drama, relentlessly intelligent on camera, impossible not to watch."
The Children Act,The film is carried through a lot... by the sheer quality and watchability of Thompson's performance.
The Children Act,"This isn't cinema so much as Sunday evening television, with a moral dilemma laid out in straight-arrow scenes stripped of much cinematic sensibility."
The Children Act,"This is very Ian McEwan: tasteful, restrained, high-minded, controlled."
The Children Act,"In one shot Thompson turns in the middle of a dialogue crisis to take one of those two-steps towards the camera, face aglow with ""hold my pose"" emotion, that we thought had disappeared with Lana Turner and Jane Wyman."
The Children Act,"It's a disappointingly muddled affair, too buttoned up and self-conscious to work as melodrama but not especially insightful about the legal profession either."
The Children Act,"Emma Thompson's performance, so elegant and vulnerable, carries the picture."
The Children Act,[Emma] Thompson deserves another best actress nomination and you will want to marry Stanley Tucci.
The Children Act,"A gentle reminder that Thompson belongs in the spotlight, as her performance burns out long after the film does."
The Children Act,"Another reminder, if one were needed, of the subtlety and skill of Emma Thompson's stratospheric talent."
The Children Act,"Ian McEwan specializes in preposterous plots, and The Children Act is as contrived as anything in his posh, voluminous, award-winning repertoire."
The Children Act,"Like so many of the movies that stem from McEwan's novels, ""The Children Act"" is a soulful and sophisticated adult drama that peers into the void between the beauty of ideals and the cost of living by them."
The Children Act,"A heartbreaking lament for loves lost and lives unrealised, a restrained, nuanced movie about nuance and restraint."
The Children Act,"If Emma Thompson can't make this drama about a family-court judge conflicted over her own decisions and the precarious state of her own family into something interesting and meaningful, then no one can. And she can't."
The Children Act,The two central performances could hardly be better. Thompson works here with remarkable subtlety.
The Children Act,"The Children Act is a cerebral piece, for sure, and a disturbing one by the end, but Thompson's performance brings life to the complex moral questions it attempts to examine."
The Children Act,"... ""The Children Act"" is that rarest of things: an adult drama, written and interpreted with a sensitivity to mature human concerns..."
The Children Act,"[Emma] Thompson who carries the film, both literally - she's rarely off-screen - and emotionally; the burden of this particular case weighs down almost every line of dialogue, registers in almost every expression on her face."
Final Portrait,Geoffrey Rush so excels at playing real-life figures... that one welcomes the very idea of him as sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti.
Final Portrait,"Stop me if you've heard this one before (no, seriously. stop me). A depraved creative genius is on a quest to find artistic value in living, treating everyone around 'him' like sh*t in the process."
Final Portrait,"It's always interesting to ask artists how they know their work is finished. Whatever else goes on this ""Final Portrait,"" Tucci captures that struggle perfectly."
Final Portrait,"But the magic of the film lies in [Stanley] Tucci's eye for a sense of place - Paris in the Sixties - and while the scenes in Giacometti's studio are all blacks and grays, there are shining moments of color that sparkle."
Final Portrait,"Working from his own screenplay, Stanley Tucci (best known as an actor) delivers a character study that's low on character development."
Final Portrait,"This movie is, literally, about watching paint dry - but Tucci and the cast find a world of detail and nuance."
Final Portrait,The rare biopic of a visual artist that considers the dilemma of the art more seriously than it considers the drama of the life.
Final Portrait,The story doesn't amount to much more than a hill of beans but Tucci manages to make his rumination on the life of an artist slyly amusing and believable.
Final Portrait,"We get a vivid image of Giacometti, but after a time the film leaves us starving for some variety, too."
Final Portrait,"Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth."
Final Portrait,"As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind."
Final Portrait,"""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being."
Final Portrait,"Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something."
Final Portrait,"This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off."
Final Portrait,"""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting."
Final Portrait,"A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche."
Final Portrait,"Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works."
Final Portrait,"The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey."
Final Portrait,An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.
Final Portrait,"An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in."
Final Portrait,"""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama."
Final Portrait,Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers.
Final Portrait,"Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch."
Final Portrait,"The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it."
Final Portrait,"As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries."
Final Portrait,Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature.
Final Portrait,"Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score."
Final Portrait,"Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist."
Final Portrait,The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.
Final Portrait,"In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio."
Final Portrait,"There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro."
Final Portrait,"Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ..."
Final Portrait,"Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature."
Final Portrait,"It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment."
Final Portrait,"Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better."
Final Portrait,"There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines."
Final Portrait,"Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years."
Final Portrait,A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.
Final Portrait,"As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking."
Final Portrait,"Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance."
Final Portrait,"This relatively concise passion project won't, in the end, stop viewers getting the cramps that come with much longer sittings."
Final Portrait,"In ""Final Portrait,"" Stanley Tucci, directing his first film in 10 years, takes the biopic to an even more exquisitely homespun level of miniature close-up."
The Happy Prince,"By turns melancholy, witty, brutal, and sensual, the film is distinguished by its artful weave of time and memory, and by Everett's uncompromising performance as Wilde during his final years."
The Happy Prince,"Everett's direction is full of beautiful surfaces and witty lines, but there's not much beneath them."
The Happy Prince,"Actor Rupert Everett's mistitled The Happy Prince marks his debut as a film director, and the subject matter is clearly close to his heart."
The Happy Prince,An honest-but-shapeless portrait that is more than warts-and-all. It's all warts.
The Happy Prince,I'm a little frustrated that I didn't enjoy the movie more than I ultimately did.
The Happy Prince,"There are scenes during which Everett's Wilde commands our wide-eyed attention, still mesmerizing despite his physical and psychological decline. Yet in between those quickened moments, The Happy Prince trudges forward with monotonous uniformity."
The Happy Prince,"Given a role built exactly to his strengths, Butler also gives maybe his finest performance as Hunter Killer's first-time commander."
The Happy Prince,"The title of Oscar Wilde's fairy tale ""The Happy Prince"" was not his subtlest use of irony, but as seen in Rupert Everett's film that bears the same name, it was tragically apt."
The Happy Prince,"Florid but warmhearted - much like the man at its center - ""The Happy Prince"" is a haunting portrait of the aftermath of betrayal; of how the master of comedy became a tragedy."
The Happy Prince,It's a passion project that never devolves into mere passion; a sober (if loving) look at an inebriated soul.
The Happy Prince,"[Everett] delivers a towering and persuasive performance in a mostly sombre and sorrowful film and, as director, does a fine job of capturing the period detail."
The Happy Prince,"""The Happy Prince"" conveys the declining Wilde's pain, despair and self-pity, but also the writer's defiant banter."
The Happy Prince,"Director-actor Rupert Everett tackles Oscar Wilde in his later years, and proves this was the role he was born to play. Get ready to marvel at an award-caliber performance."
The Happy Prince,"What [Everett] brings to the table--as a director, writer, and actor --is his intuitive 'take' on Oscar Wilde and the performance alone makes this riveting and revelatory viewing."
The Happy Prince,"Despite its undercurrent of anger at Wilde's mistreatment by fashionable English society, the film feels like a vanity production..."
The Happy Prince,"Everett is a massive Wilde fan, and knowing his appreciation for the material makes up for its deficiencies in style."
The Happy Prince,"Tells the gay scribe's tragic, slyly poetic story in a dreamy, inventive and beautifully crafted way that decidedly sets it apart."
The Happy Prince,"It's possible to see the flaws in The Happy Prince and still be deeply moved by Everett's immersive, full-bodied portrayal of the writer."
The Happy Prince,"Beneath the prosthetics, there's genuine pathos in Mr. Everett's portrayal of a man bitterly aware that his talents are unreliable armor against the perceived sin of his homosexuality."
The Happy Prince,"Because of the lack of depth in supporting characters and half-baked writing, this movie couldn't have ended fast enough."
The Happy Prince,"Everett shows little sense of how to structure his material, or how to shoot it, or even sometimes how to act it, but he does have one key element that sees him through: keen insight into Wilde's world and character. And this insight gets him pretty far."
The Happy Prince,"For every haunting sequence in The Happy Prince, there's five that redundantly wallow in Wilde's misery, which is Everett's point, but it becomes wearisome."
The Happy Prince,The thing that's most impressive is that it's well directed.
The Happy Prince,Rupert Everett the writer-director isn't as impressive as Rupert Everett the actor.
The Happy Prince,"A sad film, but ravishingly so."
The Happy Prince,"Even if his prosthetics make him look a bit like James May, Everett is near-flawless, and his film is a superb showcase for an actor whose celebrity has at times overshadowed his talent."
The Happy Prince,"Everett's familiarity with Wilde's work means that he gets the lyrical patter just right and his connection to the character feels genuine. A shame, then, that the film's formal qualities are so distracting."
The Happy Prince,"Everett deserves praise for not turning Wilde turned into some kind of gay saint. Our hero is the victim of homophobia, yes, but also insecure and manipulative."
The Happy Prince,This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter.
The Happy Prince,"A role like this presents a particular challenge for Everett... If his performance as Wilde comes off, it is because as a director he has built the film to compensate for his own shortcomings."
The Happy Prince,"Everett wrote the script, directed, and plays Oscar. He is wonderful in his forlorn, fat-suited gravity..."
The Happy Prince,"As a director, Everett is sometimes heavy-handed, but the performances, and the undeniable injustice of Wilde's ordeal, make for a tragedy worthy of its drama-loving subject."
The Happy Prince,"The Happy Prince proves that a film can be both bleak and warm-spirited, as befits its mighty subject."
The Happy Prince,"It may sound bleak but there's a captivating warmth, humour and vigour to this heartfelt passion project. That's because Rupert Everett not only lives and breathes Wilde but also his world."
The Happy Prince,A poignant story that is almost eclipsed by the egoistic frolics of its creator.
The Happy Prince,Both moving and revealing.
The Happy Prince,"It's a fearless, committed, and award-worthy turn, and emblematic of a first-time film-maker at his most expressive and most affecting."
The Happy Prince,"There are real virtues to its comparative lack of polish: this story gains a seamy power from the rough edges, the exploratory style, even the slightly unstable editing."
The Happy Prince,"It's a performance worth indulging, even if, on the whole, Everett's impassioned project isn't."
The Happy Prince,There's nothing happy here.
The Happy Prince,"He's a strikingly tragic creature, but ""The Happy Prince"" struggles to say much more about that conundrum, leaving one to contemplate the potential had [Oscar] Wilde emerged from retirement to fill in the blanks."
The Happy Prince,"As a final, permanent showcase for a role Everett was born to play, then, ""The Happy Prince"" does the job."
The Happy Prince,An absorbing but shapeless bio-drama that never gains much steam.
The Happy Prince,"This film is a deeply felt, tremendously acted tribute to courage."
The Happy Prince,The Happy Prince is easily elevated past period Victoriana (and that wallpaper) to move and engage in equal parts.
Loving Vincent,"Michal Weçel's ""Loving Vincent: The Impossible Dream"" is a lively, lightning-paced documentary."
Loving Vincent,"Miki Wecel's film will prove fascinating not only to animation and Vincent Van Gogh buffs, but to anyone interested in how the creative sausage is made."
Monsters and Men,Seems to be quite deliberately attempting not to enflame but inform.
Monsters and Men,"It's smoothly done, by the writer-director Reinaldo Marcus Green, with few histrionics and delicate jumps between three separate stories."
Monsters and Men,"John David Washington's role is more muted than in 'BlacKkKlansman', but he shows tantalising glimpses of dad Denzel's effortless charisma."
Monsters and Men,"Inevitably, some chapters work better than others but it's an interesting, sideways look at how violence can serve as a catalyst rather than a climax and how it can change - and galvanise - a community."
Monsters and Men,"There are no answers here, easy or otherwise, only dilemmas and counterpoints. A remarkably sure-footed first film from writer-director Green."
Monsters and Men,It starts an important discussion but doesn't dig deep enough.
Monsters and Men,It is very well acted and deals with familiar material in a subtle and sensitive fashion.
Monsters and Men,"There is humanity and complexity in this welcome movie, as well as muscular power and unreconciled anger."
Monsters and Men,"Both cinematic and literary, this is mature, textured work. Gently prodding at you rather than grabbing you by the throat, it is intentionally unexplosive, but lights a fire nevertheless."
Monsters and Men,"Wayward and unsettled in style and story, as if to reflect the restlessness of cul-de-sac lives, it never catches at its characters for long enough to make their unsettled waywardness compelling."
Monsters and Men,'Monsters and Men' will go down as a Black Lives Matter film that upended the format and presented us with a direct mirror as to what black and brown folks feel during this pivotal and crucial time in our society.
Monsters and Men,"A lesser movie might weave these threads into a narrative that exploits real-world parallels - viral social media, athletes who take a knee, cops who close ranks. ""Monsters And Men"" doesn't pander or dismiss."
Monsters and Men,"The film seems so freshly ripped from today's headlines that it feels like there's still more of the story to be told, which in a sense, there is."
Monsters and Men,"Despite its many loose ends and overblown title, Monsters and Men is a memorable first film that has an air of having wafted in from the streets. Infused with tenderness and humanity, Green's film ultimately encourages empathy and understanding."
Monsters and Men,"Green illuminates his characters with care and subtlety, allowing them to live inside shades of grey that a black-and-white world rarely allows."
Monsters and Men,"Green's graceful direction and keen ear for dialogue certainly make him a new filmmaker to watch, and it'll be fascinating to see what he does with a more focused narrative."
Monsters and Men,"John David Washington is at his forceful best in this racially-charged drama from debuting filmmaker Reinaldo Marcus Green that uses the perspective of three persons of color to examine the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white cop,"
Monsters and Men,"Monsters and Men offers neither unalloyed despair nor implausible hope. It's about the way people of color live now, moving through the streets with passion, purpose and one eye on the rear-view mirror."
Monsters and Men,"It's left to the actors... to keep us close, and not one of them shirks the task, injecting intellectual and emotional nuance that frequently transcends the script."
Monsters and Men,"A politically astute, emotionally layered examination of a violent death and its lingering psychic residue."
Monsters and Men,"This is all pretty straightforward, helped by good performances from the three principals."
Monsters and Men,"Its innate intelligence and matter-of-fact sensitivity are the kinds of storytelling assets we need more of, especially when the fabric of life for many continues to fray and tear in ways that demand a larger societal reassessing."
Monsters and Men,"Monsters and Men is a rather straightforward ripped-from-the-headlines story. But it's aided by a narrative structure that highlights complexity, rather than tidy symmetry."
Monsters and Men,"Like many films tackling socially inflammatory material, Monsters and Men is constrained by its politics."
Monsters and Men,"Reinaldo Marcus Green writes and directs the unraveling stories, never bringing any of the subplots to a fitting conclusion. Cinematographer Patrick Scola's camerawork is the film's greatest asset."
Monsters and Men,"Monsters and Men excels when it dives into the complications of race and authority, articulated vividly by three excellent lead performances."
Monsters and Men,"Superbly acted and impactful, Monsters and Men is a film about having the difficult conversations even when the answers to our questions might not be readily available."
Monsters and Men,"There's an expert fluidity to the chain of events and their direct impact on three men of color just trying to live honest, productive lives."
Monsters and Men,"... Monsters and Men gestures to the vast scope of what's really being spoken about here, and yet still maintains its arresting immediacy, its particular beauty."
Monsters and Men,"For the people Green most hopes to engage, he hasn't given them quite enough to work with."
Fireworks,ERROR
Marshall,This real-life case makes for an entertaining courtroom drama that nonetheless reduces Marshall to the level of Perry Mason and consigns to the end credits his greater triumphs arguing Brown vs. Board of Education and other landmark civil rights cases.
Marshall,Marshall isn't so different from a well-made TV movie. But it plays well on the big screen anyway...
Marshall,The film does have the desired effects on the less demanding parts of the brain. And Marshall's story is one worth hearing.
Marshall,The courtroom scenes are pretty paint-by-the-numbers; things feel less sterile when the action moves into smoky jazz clubs and on to rain-slicked streets.
Marshall,This is either one brilliant satirical commentary on traditional racial stereotypes in Hollywood movies or it's not.
Marshall,This real-life case makes for an entertaining courtroom drama that nonetheless reduces Marshall to the level of Perry Mason and consigns to the end credits his greater triumphs.
Marshall,"In ignoring the lived reality of colorism, Marshall creates a circumscribed version of blackness that's easy for white audiences to consume, lacks any sort of challenging narrative, and bypasses the more fascinating wrinkles in its characters' lives."
Marshall,The tight focus helps make Marshall more courtroom drama than biopic.
Marshall,"[Boseman is] totally convincing as an energetic young man, blessed with fierce idealism and swaggering charisma."
Marshall,A relatively bland historical drama is at its best when toeing the line between the comical irony of racism and the outright brutality it inspires
Marshall,"The problem with this hokey courtroom drama isn't that it says the right thing in the wrong way, the problem is that it ultimately doesn't say anything at all."
Marshall,A distinct snapshot not only of the main character but of the setting that resulted in his becoming historically important.
Marshall,"Boseman has headlined biopics before as James Brown and Jackie Robinson, and here, he imbues the young Marshall with a quiet confidence and a dogged devotion to truth and justice."
Marshall,The shortcomings that separate Marshall from Hidden Figures and Loving are the same ones that give it the feeling of a TV movie.
Marshall,"Marshall isn't particularly interested in going deep on Thurgood Marshall the man-it's more about the Marshall, the myth. That said, what it is is just fine."
Marshall,"Marshall reminds us that before the legend, there was the badass young warrior."
Marshall,"By all means, see this film. Just make sure to learn more about the great man at its center as soon as possible after you exit the theatre."
Marshall,"I kept hoping that Marshall would take off and soar, which it never quite does... but it tells its story well."
Marshall,"Charged by Boseman's dramatic lightning, Marshall gives us an electrifying glimpse of a great man in the making."
Marshall,...balances clichés against the far-more interesting subject of unlikely camaraderie that blooms out of mutual persecution.
Marshall,"Chadwick Boseman makes a charismatic Thurgood Marshall, but the biopic Marshall is not what the legendary man deserved; its focus is too often turned away from Marshall himself."
Marshall,"You have to think there are better ways to tell the story of Marshall, his life and his climb to the land's highest court, but those details are left to post-script notes."
Marshall,"For a film simply called ""Marshall,"" you do expect to get a wider slice of his life, which is relegated to onscreen text. In fact, he ultimately becomes an ensemble player in his own eponymous film."
Marshall,"This is an absorbing drama on many levels, as a courtroom mystery, as a historical depiction of the roots and mechanics of social change, and as a personal story."
Marshall,The last time a Supreme Court justice got this treatment was never.
Marshall,"Though this is not the biofilm Marshall deserves, this glimpse does offer a view of the ingenuity, perseverance and courage that propelled the Howard University law student into becoming a crusading attorney..."
Marshall,"Marshall isn't exactly a marvel, but it's very good."
Marshall,What we get of Marshall in Marshall is fascinating; if only there was more.
Marshall,"While the film is constructed from top to bottom for maximum popular entertainment, it is unwilling to let us leave the theater without reminding us that these battles are far from over."
Marshall,"It's fun, it's lively, and it's a hell of a show, but at times, it's also just a little empty."
Marshall,"Here's something refreshing-a great-man biopic, simply titled Marshall, that's more concerned with the man in his earlier years than with the greatness to come."
Marshall,"While not the most artful of biographical dramas, when it comes to bringing to life a young, rising attorney deploying the kind of legal acumen that would later make him a boundary-bursting giant, Marshall keeps its eyes on the prize."
Marshall,"Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other's moment; they're fun to watch."
Marshall,"By avoiding his most famous case, while at the same time preserving history - and adding pulpy thrills - ""Marshall"" is more involving than any textbook or documentary could be."
Marshall,"Anchored by topnotch performances by Chadwick Boseman in the title role and Josh Gad, it's a 75-year-old story imbued with modern-day resonance."
Marshall,Marshall arguably intends for societal 20/20 hindsight to provide the bulk of perspective throughout.
Marshall,"I don't know if Chadwick Boseman can leap tall buildings in a single bound, but the superman of biopics certainly has a knack for towering figures."
Marshall,"[Chadwick] Boseman gives a sly interpretation of Marshall, simultaneously cocky, philandering, and charismatically crazy-smart."
Marshall,"""Marshall"" is one of the freshest and most entertaining films of the year."
Marshall,"There's enough in Thurgood Marshall's story for another two or three movies, but this one's an engaging chapter in the early morning hours of the civil rights era."
Marshall,Boseman and Gad are both good.
Marshall,"In this time of intensifying, acrimonious racial division, maybe what we could all use is an old-fashioned courtroom drama that extols the virtues of justice and equality."
Marshall,"""Marshall"" revisits such serious history that it feels almost disrespectful to talk about it as a fun movie, but it is."
Marshall,"Never underestimate the power of a courtroom drama: the ringing questions, the preening lawyers, the dramatic pauses, the clicking of puzzle pieces fitting together, the ultimate belief in justice for all."
Marshall,"A sometimes slight, sometimes serious courtroom drama, shot through with bright certainty in the coming triumphs for Marshall and the civil rights movement. It's a superhero-style origin story: Thurgood, pre-""Brown v. Board of Education,"" pre-black robe."
Marshall,"Failing to be incisive or moving, ""Marshall"" is content to be genial and unthreatening -- two adjectives that have never been used to describe the long, hard, ongoing fight for equality."
Marshall,"Sometimes gripping and sometimes silly, a likable entertainment that never purports to resemble in any convincing way the people and times it depicts."
Marshall,"It pays attention to issues of racial, religious and gender discrimination without wavering from its main objective: giving us an entertaining film about a couple of guys who are in way over their heads."
Marshall,The movie urgently dramatizes the threat of racist violence that poisons personal relationships and judicial proceedings alike.
Marshall,"It's interesting enough, but that's not usually sufficient recommendation to get audiences out to a theater."
Marshall,"By approaching Marshall as just another idealistic young trial lawyer, the film stands on its own as a compelling courtroom drama, complete with surprising revelations ..."
The Florida Project,"It’s superficially less bleak than Tangerine, rendered by Baker in tropical colours, but poverty lurks throughout."
The Florida Project,"I knew form the first shot that I was watching a truly great movie... It's so real, it's so raw."
The Florida Project,"A work that combines boundless energy and childlike enthusiasm with dark social realism, Sean Baker's wildly inventive style of filmmaking has resulted in the gorgeous masterpiece that is The Florida Project."
The Florida Project,"Little Moonee is innocent in every sense that counts, and even her worst misdeeds are fuelled by excitement at the possibilities of life."
The Florida Project,"The world captured by Sean Baker's lens is colourful and bright, despite its impoverished inhabitants, and he never judges or pities them for their choices, even if you might. Here is a movie that shows, not tells."
The Florida Project,"There isn't much of a narrative going on here, but Baker succeeds in enveloping the viewer in a very particular place."
The Florida Project,"Baker's work with his largely inexperienced cast is relaxed and playful, and the film's tone is fairly assured."
The Florida Project,"Another superbly sympathetic portrait of marginalised experience from a film-maker whose great triumph is that he never feels like a tourist. This is Moonee's world, and for a couple of hours at least, we are privileged to live in it."
The Florida Project,"The audience is invited to believe that their lives are devoid of thoughts and motivations beyond hustle and pleasure, and so the movie ends up feeling like a millennial Instagram feed: cute, edgy, explosive, pithy, but shallow."
The Florida Project,"The camera, if especially respectful towards the children, refuses to demonise any of the characters."
The Florida Project,"The Florida Project absolutely sings as a visual achievement, and not only as that."
The Florida Project,The Florida Project is one of the best films about childhood made anywhere in recent years.
The Florida Project,"With most films you know what you are getting within the first ten minutes -- oh, it's this film; OK -- but here there are no plot points as such and we never quite know where we're headed, which gives it the thrum of real life."
The Florida Project,"The film's sympathetic eye ensures it doesn't exoticise the family's plight, or dip into poverty porn. Drunken brawls, pissed-off johns and vicious catfights are simply day-to-day eruptions here, blowing in and out of the motel like the Florida weather."
The Florida Project,The Florida Project is a song of innocence and of experience: mainly the former.
The Florida Project,"Vibrant and brimming with vitality, this is empathic towards its subjects but fiercely critical of the system that victimises them."
The Florida Project,"For the most part what you get here are raw, non-star performances combined with knockout neon visuals."
The Florida Project,"It seems more casually curious and at times even exploitative in its attempt to center the narrative of a poor, marginalized single mother and her precocious young daughter."
The Florida Project,"... a funny, gut-wrenching, emotionally complex masterwork of the human condition that exudes warmth and humility in every frame."
The Florida Project,"Quite simply, one of the best films about childhood ever made."
The Florida Project,"The Florida Project, though, dances deftly around kitchen-sink realism and instead looks at this pastel world through the eyes of characters too young to know, or care, that they aren't rich."
The Florida Project,[Director Sean Baker's] frantic depiction of Moonee's final fantasy verges on both brilliance and heartbreak.
The Florida Project,"It's one of the most effective, honest portraits of childhood you'll ever see, and a touching, poignant snapshot of American life in 2017."
The Florida Project,"You feel as if you've slipped inside of Moonee's enchanted world, while at the same time seeing the harsh reality of Halley's. That contrast is devastating, right up to a final sequence that's sure to break your heart in two."
The Florida Project,"The Florida Project is certainly lively, but it is anything but redemptive. In spite of its episodic documentary quality, it traces an overdetermined downward spiral."
The Florida Project,"Baker places no dramatic emphasis on any individual scene, granting a sense of wide-eyed wonder to major and minor events alike."
The Florida Project,"This is a story told with authenticity and power, helped along by its cast of newcomers."
The Florida Project,"It's film that'll make you wince at times, and you'll most likely not want to see twice, but seeing it once is an experience you'll not soon forget."
The Florida Project,"This movie puts the wild, comic tales of resourceful poor kids into a frame, pulling back just enough to make it clear that the situation Moonee's in - while exciting - is untenable."
The Florida Project,"Alexis Zabe's rapturous cinematography reminds us that magic is where you find it. You don't need a golden ticket to Mickey's kingdom, although you can see it from here."
The Florida Project,"The sun-washed reality of The Florida Project, which concludes with a touch of poetry that might break you in two. It's not a happy ending, but it is, like the rest of the film, pretty much perfect."
The Florida Project,"Dafoe delivers his finest performance in recent memory, bringing to levelheaded, unsanctimonious life a character who offers a glimmer of hope and caring within a world markedly short on both."
The Florida Project,"The Florida Project may seem to have more episodes than a narrative through line, but that seems also true to the occupants of the Magic Kingdom, who believe they're simply in a transitional state while they're actually stuck in idle."
The Florida Project,"Dafoe has never had a role this warm and sweet, and he plays it for low-keyed honesty. The kids and the adults, some non-professionals, all become part of a bright purple beehive."
The Florida Project,"Rarely in a movie will you want a character to succeed more than Moonee. Yet Baker doesn't sugarcoat the odds, which, despite eventual moments of real magic, remain long indeed."
The Florida Project,"""The Florida Project"" is - in nerve, guts, heart, and mind - one of the finest films of 2017."
The Florida Project,... perfectly set up and disappointingly executed story about down-on-their-luck folks who call a motel in Orlando home.
The Florida Project,The Florida Project is perceptive to the charm and strength of character you can find in humble places.
The Florida Project,"The impression is a disturbing film of energy and compassion that left me with an inescapable sadness, from which director Baker offers no way out."
The Florida Project,"As it stands, there's a greatness in it, but also stretches of emptiness. Still, this is an original piece of work, and no one who sees it will forget it."
The Florida Project,The Florida Project is tonally playful while in fact being a wondrously sad piece of art.
The Florida Project,"Willem Dafoe knows from tortured roles (Platoon, The Last Temptation of Christ), but this creation -- a delicate blend of protector, fusspot and secret survivor -- is his richest, most lovable piece of work."
The Florida Project,"This is a deeply humanist filmmaker, and he's sympathetic to these characters, flaws and all."
The Florida Project,"Baker has imbued this whole terrific movie with a child's sense of discovery - the sort that can turn a decrepit, pastel corner of Orlando into a vibrant cinematic playground."
The Florida Project,"It is because Baker views the world without blinders that the moments of lyricism in The Florida Project are so piercing. When a rainbow shows up in the sky, it's not just a rainbow; it's a benediction."
The Florida Project,"The Florida Project is one of this year's best films, a remarkable slice of life. If ever there were a sleeper deserving of wide recognition, this is it."
The Florida Project,"Dafoe's sensitive performance anchors the movie's slippery adult world, and Baker builds a cinematic mood beautifully; the strip malls and swampland and buzzing cicadas on screen feel as real and tactile as the theater seat beneath you."
The Florida Project,"Though Moonee's story may not have a Hollywood happy ending when she's grown and the world has been cruel, Baker has created an indomitable character who's at least got a fighting chance."
The Florida Project,"The Florida Project achieves something rare and magical: presenting existence from the perspective of a young child while, at the same time, providing enough ""clues"" that viewers are able to decipher what's really going on."
The Florida Project,"All childhoods must come to an end, few of them as piercingly as the one in ""The Florida Project,"" Sean Baker's raw, exuberant and utterly captivating new movie."
The Florida Project,"As in previous films, Mr. Baker mixes amateur and professional actors to exceptional effect."
The Florida Project,Director Sean Baker crafts one of the best and toughest films about childhood ever and gives a never-better Willem Dafoe a clear shot at an Oscar.
The Florida Project,To balance joy and desperation as gracefully as Mr. Baker does - to interweave giddiness and heartbreak - is no easy feat.
The Florida Project,The Florida Project is both radiant and unsentimental.
The Florida Project,... Dafoe's warm and generous performance is simply astonishing.
The Florida Project,Sean Baker's beautiful heartbreaker scratches just below the cheery lilac and bubblegum pink to expose the layers of privation festering in this sunshiny state.
The Florida Project,"While Baker's previous movie, Tangerine, is a milestone in LGBTQ filmmaking, The Florida Project doesn't ring as true to life."
The Florida Project,"As Moonee, Brooklynn Prince is a revelation. There's not a single artificial note in her performance, just raw charm."
The Florida Project,"Underneath the vibrancy of Moonee's spirit, Baker delivers a heavy-handed statement about the fraudulent hopes offered by Disney magic, and the way so many American dreams have been shattered."
The Florida Project,"You come away better for having known this crew, a demographic that's sorely underrepresented on the screen."
The Florida Project,Sean Baker spends much of the film investing the minutia of the down-and-out lives within this little ecosystem with a bittersweet energy and significance.
The Florida Project,"A film of small notes that combine to form something major, the kind of movie that sneaks up on you and sticks with you"
The Florida Project,[Sean] Baker mostly crafts a tiny adventure of absorbing wonder.
The Florida Project,"The Florida Project won't let us look away. Nor, given its brilliance, would we want to. Instead, we laugh, we watch silently, and we're challenged to stop simplifying people's lives so we can offer easy theoretical answers."
The Florida Project,"Beautiful, vibrant, heartfelt and hilarious."
The Florida Project,The Florida Project is very much its own pink plastic beast. It is one of the great films about childhood.
The Florida Project,"The off-kilter, unusual, matter-of-fact observations from a very young child bring a fresh perspective, realism and humour to well-worn territory that too often drowns in pity, sentiment or demonisation."
The Florida Project,"A truthful and sublimely bittersweet slice of life, tracing celebratory highs and lamentable lows on the outer economic edges of the Sunshine State."
The Florida Project,"A remarkable study of poverty, family and personal responsibility, The Florida Project meticulously illustrates how life on the margins affects one impressionable six-year-old."
The Florida Project,"As a filmmaker, Baker is a graceful neorealist voyeur who thrives on improvisation, and his storytelling, in The Florida Project, is mostly just a series of anecdotes. But that turns out to be enough."
The Florida Project,"Things look grim for Halley and Moonee, but we can expect a lot from the people who brought their marvelous story to light."
The Florida Project,"The Florida Project further cements Baker's status as one of the most innovative American directors working today, but he's also an essential advocate for the stories this country often doesn't get to see."
The Florida Project,"The deceptive intelligence of The Florida Project is how immersive this bouncy-castle reality is while sitting exactly on top of the drawn-out, unremarked tragedy that is life on the margins of respectable, solvent society."
The Florida Project,A fabulous mosaic of one particular pocket of America's invisible homeless population - families living hand-to-mouth in motels originally designed to catch the tourist overspill from the flashy theme-park resorts across town.
The Florida Project,"[A] brilliant, buoyant, and ultimately heart-wrenching film."
Lizzie,"[Craig William] Macneill's approach might be described as a so-so impression of art-house understatement, with lots of wide-screen compositions that make obvious use of negative space and a flat tone that might be mistaken for dramatic restraint."
Lizzie,Takes its title character out of folk history and rewrites her as a queer proto-feminist battling against the worst excesses of patriarchal power.
Lizzie,"A two-hander with actresses of this calibre should be a humdinger, but very little about this misjudged period drama works properly."
Lizzie,"An absorbing, well-acted psychological thriller that loses its grip as it slips into sensationalism."
Lizzie,"Performances are the saving grace of a film which, while certainly not lacking in dramatic heft, seems more preoccupied with sexing up the scandal than getting to grips with those at the centre of it."
Lizzie,"Sevigny is compelling, Stewart less so, and there are few surprises. A bit TV. But not in the good way."
Lizzie,"The element of horror is treated circumspectly, almost dispassionately, as if to douse its mythic element in as much cold reality as possible."
Lizzie,"For all the horror of her situation, Lizzie needed some larger motivation to wield her axe. Lizzie dramatically provides it."
Lizzie,"Unfortunately, despite a couple of solid performances, the film doesn't break any new ground or offer any particular illumination on these grisly crimes."
Lizzie,"The movie tackles [Lizzie's sexual awakening] much more head-on -- and explicitly -- than other depictions of Borden's life, including a recent Lifetime movie and series, The Lizzie Borden Chronicles."
Lizzie,"When the time comes for the famous axe and whacks, Lizzie reveals itself as more Greek tragedy than murder mystery - a depiction of feminine ferocity and ingenuity in the face of injustice."
Lizzie,"A compelling drama of human desire, oppression, romance and regret I'll not soon forget."
Lizzie,"Borden was a cold-blooded killer, and the handsomely crafted, at times laborious Lizzie takes a step back and examines her story in a semi-modern context."
Lizzie,"While you wish the characters were a little more fleshed out, the light effectively traps you within that airless era."
Lizzie,"Macneill made a smart, unsettling and dark film, but it needs more expertise that will come with experience."
Lizzie,It remains an entirely watchable drama thanks in no small part to the charisma of its two lead women.
Lizzie,"The performances keep you invested... as do the speculations laid out by screenwriter Bryce Kass, who sticks to those facts that suit the tale he wants to tell."
Lizzie,"We wait in vain for ""Lizzie"" to do something truly surprising with this oft-told tale. But it's worth a look if only for the two central performances."
Lizzie,Macneill and Kass weaken their message of female empowerment by pushing it past politics to pulp fiction.
Lizzie,"It could use an operatic high note, or even a truly deep dark night of the soul, some oscillation in the levels. But the film reflects the evenness with which Sevigny portrays the unflappable Lizzie, cool as a cucumber all the way to court."
Lizzie,The movie's handsome appearance is complemented by assured performances.
Lizzie,"Lizzie is at war with its own impulses. You can sense there's a sexy overheated melodrama in there, yearning to burst free of its corset."
Lizzie,"Putting Kristen Stewart and Chloë Sevigny on screen together was a wonderful choice-one that doesn't deserve to be drowned in a torrent of confusing, implausible, and just downright dull ones."
Lizzie,"As lurid as the tale is, sitting through Macneill's somber movie version is like watching ye olde paint dry."
Lizzie,"The film moves evenly toward a conclusion that feels as inevitable as it does inescapable, while providing a plausible framework for the still-mysterious true crime."
Lizzie,"Lizzie attempts a straight-faced and sinister tone that manages to be shocking only in how dull it is, even while being laced with full-frontal nudity and graphic violence."
Lizzie,"Ms. Sevigny's intelligence and formidable control keep the melodrama grounded. Her empathy for Borden, whose fragile constitution belies a searing will, is palpable, as is the sense of inescapable peril surrounding the two female leads."
Lizzie,"Lizzie is brutal, historically attuned, and committed to exploring effeminate trauma and retaliation."
Lizzie,"Unfortunately, the film never quite crosses that line into campy territory, merely teasing what a less serious treatment of Lizzie's story might look like."
Lizzie,I spent most of the running time waiting for Lizzie (Chloë Sevigny) to grab the hatchet and wrap things up already.
Lizzie,"If you want a film with intrigue, murder, and women in love, skip Lizzie and watch Park Chan Wook's ""The Handmaiden."""
Lizzie,Sevigny has been ripe for a juicy role like this for some time.
Lizzie,"It's a simple story made to rouse modern hearts, and the performances and cinematography are so good, the film nearly pulls off the trick."
Lizzie,The problem is the enervated pacing and ludicrous depiction - after much fancy skipping back and forth in time - of the murders themselves.
Lizzie,At least it looks good.
Lizzie,"Lizzie isn't a bad film, but it doesn't accomplish all that it wants to-and all I wanted it to."
Lizzie,A sensitive and stylish take on the legend.
Lizzie,"Lizzie offers speculative explanation, but its theories end up answering a different question: What if Heavenly Creatures was kind of boring?"
Lizzie,The stylish and haunting Lizzie paints a provocative portrait of a woman driven by passions and left with few options in a society that gave her little agency.
Boundaries,The father's chicanery is the brightest spot in a screenplay that makes the heroine a shrill stooge for everyone else's agenda as the protagonists bicker their way to self-discovery and mutual regard.
Boundaries,"Boundaries keeps the syrup on medium, and Plummer looks like he's having a ball. If you have a penchant for broken wing syndrome, you may want to let this one into your life."
Boundaries,"A movie with no reason to exist apart from setting into motion an otherwise interesting cast, led by Christopher Plummer and Vera Farmiga."
Boundaries,"The film... crosses a line - between engaging idiosyncrasy and floundering improbability, amusing and cringeworthy."
Boundaries,Plummer and Farmiga are great together. If only they'd been given material to suit their skills.
Boundaries,"[Plummer] is incapable of mediocrity, but damn if the script doesn't draw him close to the edge."
Boundaries,"That's the easy, low-grade charm of ""Boundaries."" Like the effects of Grandpa's weed, its performances loosen up - and at times even find the profundity in - a stiff and sometimes silly tale."
Boundaries,"There's real love in that routine, and that's where Farmiga and Feste shine."
Boundaries,"Every so often, writer-director Shana Feste will drop in a line or a situation that doesn't feel like something she picked up from Indie Screenwriting Tropes 101, and you feel yourself being drawn into the story."
Boundaries,"Farmiga is too imaginative and keen for the material, and watching the elegant Plummer prattle away about his adult diapers grows wincingly weary too fast for comfort."
Boundaries,There's an unpredictability in Plummer's performance that keeps this dramedy on its toes even as its inevitably gets more and more predictable.
Boundaries,Being in the presence of Plummer these days is always time well spent.
Boundaries,"A road movie starring Christopher Plummer and Vera Farmiga, two actors I am willing to see in just about anything. Because of them, Boundaries, which might have been cooked up by a screenwriting program called RoadMovie, is halfway tolerable."
Boundaries,Boundaries is earnest in way that partly makes up for the overbroad characters and stale setup.
Boundaries,"It's hard to recall a recent movie with more exclamatory dialogue than ""Boundaries"" - ""I know how much you must hate me!"" ""You can't live without being a victim!"" - and less in the way of actual emotional revelation."
Boundaries,"Self-satisfied and too slick by half, ""Boundaries"" projects a sheen of artifice that deflects any genuine engagement with the story."
Boundaries,"It all bumps along, as road trips do, through silliness and boredom and occasional, unexpected charm. But Feste's story never really gets the rhythms right."
Boundaries,One wishes Feste had checked to see if there was any gas left in the tank of the road-trip genre before committing to its well-worn byways.
Boundaries,"""Boundaries"" fails to draw a boundary with itself - going on too long, adding too many over-the-top characters and shying away from the real issue at hand: How can Laura draw a boundary and be respected by the men in her life?"
Boundaries,Boundaries clearly wants to approximate the messy rhythms of real life. But its way into this material is constant oscillation between broad antics and hopped-up domestic drama.
Boundaries,"Christopher Plummer brings a twinkly eyed insouciance to his character, but there's only so many times Jack can make a joke about, say, his adult diapers before it becomes thin and hollow."
Boundaries,"The road trip movie may be a film festival staple, but Boundaries could be proof that this subgenre has run out of gas."
Boundaries,"A fantastic cast doing fine work can't make this feel-good hokum believable, and most viewers who walk away satisfied are those who'd happily watch any new Plummer vehicle, just to celebrate the actor's enduring vitality and charm."
Boundaries,"Boundaries breaks no fresh ground and sags into conventional story beats on autopilot, but it's rewarding enough to hang with these characters and roll with their mudslinging."
Boundaries,A touching yet wised-up father-daughter road movie that's the best version of this sort of film you could imagine ...
Blaze,"Blaze is worth seeing, partly as it’s the first foray into the world of feature films by an original artist, but perhaps more importantly for the performance of its young actor."
Blaze,"It’s strong stuff, underpinned by Savage’s remarkable work in the leading role."
Blaze,"Like Barton’s startling artistic vision, Blaze is a masterpiece."
Blaze,"A hot, sticky, trippy fusion of wild style and painfully genuine emotion, with plenty of moments that take your breath away."
Blaze,"“Blaze” marks the feature directing debut of a distinctive new voice, and though there’s a certain woodenness to the narrative, the visuals — glitter dreams of a 10-foot fuchsia dragon — radiate with originality."
The Little Stranger,The players are technically impressive but fail to make any significant emotional impact.
The Little Stranger,"There are moments of stark, unexpected violence, and chilling moments that hint at the ghosts within, but mostly The Little Stranger is a horror mystery that revels in its ambiguity. But the near two hour run time feels overlong."
The Little Stranger,"Casting issues aside, Abrahamson delivers an engrossing dark tale of the struggle to find solid ground when all around crumbles in a gothic maelstrom."
The Little Stranger,"[Domhnall Gleeson] keeps Faraday's wounds painfully close to the surface... Faraday's bitterness works like a depressant, consuming him but also the movie, and robbing it of some of the electrical charge vital for fully effective horror."
The Little Stranger,"If you love strange little things, you'll be smitten."
The Little Stranger,Why... does this handsomely mounted tale of a country doctor and a seemingly cursed aristocratic family not quite work?
The Little Stranger,It's brave enough to take its time.
The Little Stranger,"There could be rational explanations for all these things, but the film invites us to lean gently into the fantastic."
The Little Stranger,"Its shivers are sophisticated, and not easily shrugged off."
The Little Stranger,"Abrahamson has taken [Waters'] idea and run with it. He's made a movie that's a Brexit Britain parable about the intoxicating, if futile, allure of national identity."
The Little Stranger,"Beautifully directed by Lenny Abrahamson, the film evokes this period in a way that is both nostalgic and frequently chilling."
The Little Stranger,"With Gleeson, the female stars clinch this drama of dread and desperation."
The Little Stranger,The house itself is realised with terrific creepiness and claustrophobia but ultimately its cupboards feel bare.
The Little Stranger,"Lacks the sting in the tail of something like the similarly post-War The Others, but it offers a soupy atmosphere of low-level dread and paints a devastating portrait of a vanishing age."
The Little Stranger,We know everyone involved in this film can do better.
The Little Stranger,"Occasionally spooky, but more often snoozy."
The Little Stranger,A deft exploration of controlling and entitled masculinity.
The Little Stranger,A hypnotic and haunting tale of how the past can grab hold of the flesh-and-blood present and squeeze. Don't let this mesmerizing mystery slip between the cracks of studio neglect and marketing indifference. It's spellbinding.
The Little Stranger,"Everything here is precise: Abrahamson's direction, the understated performances, the intrusive sounds that stop just shy of jarring. The result is more sad and spooky than suspenseful or scary, an effect that seems entirely, and pleasingly, intentional."
The Little Stranger,"At times, each of the main characters has us wondering what's going on beneath the surface. Who, if anyone, is to be trusted?"
The Little Stranger,"[An] elegant, cold-to-the-touch blend of drama and gothic horror."
The Little Stranger,The Little Stranger is one of the best films of the year. The trouble is that it's a tricky film to sell or even discuss without spoilers.
The Little Stranger,"Abrahamson seems fascinated with the idea of gothic storytelling, but he hasn't quite got the knack of it."
The Little Stranger,"The movie, like towering Hundreds Hall, casts its own foreboding spell."
The Little Stranger,"Some strangers aren't worth getting to know, and this is one of them."
The Little Stranger,"Gleeson and Wilson deliver tightly-wound performances, while the ending is more chilling, and perhaps perplexing, than audiences might expect."
The Little Stranger,"The Little Stranger is too airless and derivative, with too many stretches of dullness, to resurrect the dormant genre. Only a few interesting performances occasionally jolt it back to life."
The Little Stranger,The film just glumly proceeds.
The Little Stranger,"The entire film has the sense of something being profoundly, and mercifully, upended; the result is engrossing, satisfying, and more than a little heartbreaking."
The Little Stranger,"A slow-building shiver of a movie, ""The Little Stranger"" tells a familiar but pleasurably engrossing story."
The Little Stranger,Perhaps the film's failure to surprise in the end is a result of leaning too heavily on a toolbox not yet translated into the language of cinematic form.
The Little Stranger,"With its closely observed sympathy for thwarted lives, it could be a Terence Davies movie. And with all that, it's a ghost story, too, but of a very special sort."
The Little Stranger,"Horror-movie fans should be warned that it's all quite subtle. But it's haunting, in its quiet way."
The Little Stranger,"It's just a little underdeveloped. Perhaps in novel form its polite pace and subtle revelations made a certain amount of sense, but the movie is lacking."
The Little Stranger,"It's unfortunate when visionary directors stumble into banal material, but Abrahamson's displayed such flexibility that even this sort of miscalculation speaks to the versatility of his talent."
The Little Stranger,"Like flesh without a skeleton to support it, the film ultimately collapses in a hollowed-out heap."
The Little Stranger,Marrying social commentary with spookiness doesn't just make for effective storytelling; it underlines just how frightening it is to live in a world where your station in life controls your happiness.
The Little Stranger,"The Little Stranger captures a sense of gathering, inchoate dread that is all the more unsettling because it doesn't fit into any easy genre categories."
The Little Stranger,"A character-driven psychological thriller, one whose larger implications will trouble your mind, like a ghost."
The Little Stranger,Abrahamson assembles all the ingredients for Turn Of The Screw suspense but never quite twists them with the dread that needs to seep through the halls of the central stately home.
The Little Stranger,"Sneaks up on you, little by little, till the final scene smacks you in the face."
The Little Stranger,"An elegant, sinister tale of the uncanny, with its own streak of pathos."
The Little Stranger,"There are a few jump scares and shocking images, but Mr. Abrahamson lets the dread build slowly, nudged along by Stephen Rennicks's mournful, eerie score and Ole Bratt Birkeland's brown-shadowed cinematography."
The Little Stranger,"""The Little Stranger"" may be elegantly fashioned as a haunted-house thriller, but the relationships at its core are spooked by sadness well before things start to go bump in the night."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"In Moe Berg, Rudd helps director Ben Lewin (Paperback Writer, The Sessions) add another unforgettable passive hero to the his increasing menagerie."
The Catcher Was A Spy,It's an absorbing character study of a most intriguing man.
The Catcher Was A Spy,It's a less than passable espionage thriller watered down by a vague character study.
The Catcher Was A Spy,"It's so safe, and it's so dry, and it's so understated to a fault."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"The result is a juicy true story told blandly, but The Catcher Was a Spy is still a movie worth seeing."
The Catcher Was A Spy,The Catcher Was a Spy is an imperfect examination of a curiously complicated figure in American history.
The Catcher Was A Spy,I wish I liked it more.
The Catcher Was A Spy,"Handsome cinematography fails to disguise the low production value, and constant cross-cutting between strategy meetings and the mission itself make both parts of the sandwich feel moldy."
The Catcher Was A Spy,A much more pallid experience than this eminently juicy subject deserves.
The Catcher Was A Spy,"The movie is well-crafted, but it doesn't have the fullness you'd expect in a movie with so much believe-it-or-not weirdness. It feels more like a nifty anecdote."
The Catcher Was A Spy,Boring is the last word you should use for a sports-hero-turned-spy story like this; it's the only one that comes to mind after you've seen the film.
The Catcher Was A Spy,"If it wasn't a true story, it would be ridiculous. But the problem with Ben Lewin's film isn't the plausibility of the storyline, it's the execution of the plot, which comes off like a stiff noir rather than a crackling thriller."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"We want a catcher, not a belly scratcher. And there's an abundance of belly scratching going on in this film."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"The biggest adrenaline pump comes when Berg, stir-crazy after working at a desk during World War II, runs at full speed down a hallway. There's a shootout later on that gets less attention than that one short sprint."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"Somehow, The Catcher Was A Spy is flavorless and unexciting, thanks to an execution as formulaic as a well-worn copy of The Joy Of Cooking."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"""The Catcher Was a Spy"" only ever penetrates the surface - of Berg's psyche, of heroism in the face of evil, of America's pastime - so that historical events ostensibly thrilling are rendered rote."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"Berg and Heisenberg conduct most of their dialogue, when they finally meet, in chess moves. And the movie tantalizingly leaves open the question of whether the game ended in a mate or a resignation."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"Lewin has crafted a biopic spy thriller, kind of, but the script has neither the character shadings to be a biopic nor the pacing and twist and turns to be a spy thriller."
The Catcher Was A Spy,Missed opportunities are everywhere.
The Catcher Was A Spy,The film proves to be oddly uninvolving.
The Catcher Was A Spy,"Berg was an enigmatic and underappreciated Renaissance Man, and we leave the film not especially enlightened."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"Despite sterling performances, ""The Catcher Was a Spy"" ultimately loses its luster in the murk surrounding the man it calls a ""walking enigma."""
The Catcher Was A Spy,"It's a disappointingly mild period thriller that's light on thrills. Even Paul Rudd, one of the most likable actors in Hollywood, can't rescue it."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"The script, by Robert Rodat, skips around in time to elucidate the amped-up drama, but it never gets close to Berg's own character."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"As the film proceeds, the appeal of its nostalgia wears thin and you may notice that there isn't much beyond the window dressing."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"A very enjoyable middle-of-the-road adventure, especially for moviegoers willing to see just about anything starring Rudd."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"Paul Rudd is fantastic as the enigmatic Moe Berg, a real life footnote from history in the serviceable thriller The Catcher Was A Spy."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"So much of the nuance and the outright, exhilarating contradictions of a man like Berg are burned off in the exhaust of a roving and disjointed war story."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"But for a movie that wants to tell you this unbelievable story about a smart guy, ""The Catcher Was a Spy"" shows its hand with faux-intellectualism."
The Catcher Was A Spy,"There's a curious lack of credibility and urgency in this big-screen adaptation, the kind of respectable near-miss that can happen when worthy talent apply themselves to a project they're just not ideally suited for."
On Chesil Beach,Once McEwan fully exposes the couple's compromised relationship there are some strong scenes of them surveying the wreckage together.
On Chesil Beach,I really did believe in the central couple and their alienation.
On Chesil Beach,"Unfortunately, by the final act of the film we've lost any empathy for these two. And there's little rationale as to why they should matter to anyone else."
On Chesil Beach,"These two really do love each other, but Florence cannot abide the physical realm. The director gives us a clear indication of why, and then ignores the elephant he has made sure we see."
On Chesil Beach,These fine actors vividly bring McEwan's troubled lovers to life.
On Chesil Beach,On Chesil Beach doesn't hit all the right notes but it does enough to be a graceful period drama about the unfulfilled promises we make to each other and ourselves.
On Chesil Beach,"For viewers, the remainder of On Chesil Beach becomes consumed with trying to figure out who hurt Florence - which is actually a pretty crappy way to watch a movie!"
On Chesil Beach,"""On Chesil Beach"" is PBS-tasteful in its approach, but its power rests in a restraint that makes what it builds to all the more moving."
On Chesil Beach,"What had been impossibly sweet becomes simply impossible, and old-fashioned mores prove unsuited to the task of navigating the emotional morass."
On Chesil Beach,"""On Chesil Beach"" clumsily deals with the issues it addresses."
On Chesil Beach,"On Chesil Beach communicates all this miscommunication perfectly, capturing precisely the time and the culture, and most especially the era's tightly wrapped attitudes to sexuality."
On Chesil Beach,On Chesil Beach remains a solid exercise in applied sadness. Few will be entirely unmoved. Few will be wholly satisfied.
On Chesil Beach,"[On Chesil Beach] just didn't cut it, my cold indifference once it came to an end a maddening turn of events to say the least."
On Chesil Beach,"What a prestigious, understated, classy inducement to take a nap."
On Chesil Beach,You can't doubt the film's good intentions. Its crime is the Hollywood ending.
On Chesil Beach,"There's splendid acting across the board and assured direction by Cooke, a stage veteran making his feature debut..."
On Chesil Beach,"What worked on the page, more or less, struggles on screen..."
On Chesil Beach,"If you think this is just another exercise in arthouse cinema, you're in for a surprise."
On Chesil Beach,This is seriously depressing stuff. But good! Really. Don't let the downbeat vibe scare you off. Much.
On Chesil Beach,"The filmmakers and their charmingly sympathetic leads leave us with a picture of connubial needs and desires which, while maybe improbable, conjures up all the absorbing wistfulness of a classic weepie."
On Chesil Beach,"In its own delicate way, like a piece of tear-soaked tissue paper, it holds the memory of heartbreak."
On Chesil Beach,"I half expect that ""On Chesil Beach"" may, in fact, be the driest, subtlest British comedy ever made, and that, if you were to see this in London, the audience would be falling into the aisles laughing. Or maybe not. It's impossible to say."
On Chesil Beach,Self-sabotagingly tasteful and fatally polite; so unwilling to take risks that the comforts of convention become preferable to any potentially fulfilling acts of boldness.
On Chesil Beach,"In an era where mainstream cinema often makes light of young sex with awkwardly comedic stories, On Chesil Beach almost defiantly rejects to treat this profound topic reductively."
On Chesil Beach,"Leading lady Saorise Ronan can do no wrong, but the script's focus on what it knows - straight white men - ends up causing the film to suffer irreparable damage."
On Chesil Beach,"The film is pleasingly thorny on the subject of intimacy, sexual dysfunction and trauma."
On Chesil Beach,"You watch the movie like you read a book, which leads to eventual tedium. You can't put a bookmark in a movie, come back later, and pick up where you left off."
On Chesil Beach,"...you carry on caring and hoping and praying, even if the characters do end up being slightly distant and beyond our reach."
On Chesil Beach,"While Dominic Cooke's film succeeds at much of what it attempts, I can't shake the feeling that there's a dimension missing."
On Chesil Beach,A potentially promising story of an emotional and physical impasse is flattened so much as to be offensive.
On Chesil Beach,"A highly acceptable, somewhat starched drama of crossed love. But the film fully comes into its own on the beach."
On Chesil Beach,"The movie is fairly faithful to the book (except for a couple of awful invented scenes at the end), and yet so much is lost in the transfer."
On Chesil Beach,Something of a prestige slog.
On Chesil Beach,"The kind of movie whose quiet power you can't help but appreciate, even as you know you'll probably never be able to sit through it again."
On Chesil Beach,"A completely heartbreaking story brought to exquisite life via immaculate writing, directing and acting..."
On Chesil Beach,It's a delicate story that would be impossible to adapt for film were it not for the strength of the actors involved.
On Chesil Beach,"Together, Howle and Ronan...make a bumpy contour map of the way society's mores, plus basic personal fears, can really do a number on a human's expectations of romantic partnership."
On Chesil Beach,"It's not a bad movie by any stretch, but it strains to turn a serious and introspective story into something cinematic."
On Chesil Beach,"With such confident performers and such a strong interest in their characters' personalities, Dominic Cooke has made surprisingly good work of On Chesil Beach. You couldn't pay me to sit through it again, but that's Ian McEwan's fault."
On Chesil Beach,"On Chesil Beach is a non-disaster, essentially, until it falls off a cliff."
On Chesil Beach,"Even Saoirse Ronan, in all her shining glory, can't save this stuffy adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel of carnally cursed newlyweds. There is a soulful core in this tale of love lost. You'll find it in the book, but not in this shallow film."
On Chesil Beach,The fascination of the film lies in its painstaking observation of the hapless lovers and of the world around them.
On Chesil Beach,"I haven't read McEwan's book, but now that I've seen the film I want to. Because the film doesn't quite add up, though scripted by the author."
On Chesil Beach,"The great Saoirse Ronan, whose delicate voice here contains a universe of pain, turns in another heartbreaker of a performance in Dominic Cooke's quiet British drama, set in 1962 and based on Ian McEwan's novel."
On Chesil Beach,You never really connect with these lovers any more than they connect with each other.
On Chesil Beach,"It's a good movie. The book is something more - close to perfect, I would say - but since both incarnations emphasize the importance of tolerating human fallibility, I won't make too much of the discrepancy."
On Chesil Beach,"On Chesil Beach is a minor story by design, one that uses a lovers' quarrel to interrogate evolving social values, but sometimes it's the most minor stories that contain some of the most overlooked ideas."
On Chesil Beach,"The film's imaginative daring springs from its willingness to render repression sexy, even if it will prove to be the seed of a young couple's dissolution."
On Chesil Beach,"An opulent, well crafted and acted tale of emotional repression that captures the head more than the heart."
On Chesil Beach,"Unfortunately, the film sends the fragile characters on a far more traditional arc than does the book, culminating in a sentimental, ""present-day"" climax complete with tear-stained old-age latex makeup."
On Chesil Beach,"On Chesil Beach presents a deeply moving story with intricate ramifications and a big secret at the heart of its storyline, but the film somehow fails to ignite the same feelings and emotions as the book does."
On Chesil Beach,"The text is rich with stylistic flourishes and social observations, and boasts a genuinely wrenching closing sequence. The film, alas, is not."
On Chesil Beach,"A solid drama made from a stellar book, but if you see it even just for the two performances, you won't be disappointed."
On Chesil Beach,"The lead actors are both marvellous... Yet the film's most impressive performance might come from director Dominic Cooke, who has delivered an assured, wistful debut."
On Chesil Beach,Holds the viewer in its genteel grip from start to almost finish.
On Chesil Beach,"Even with author Ian McEwan adapting his own novel for the screen, this somewhat stilted picture struggles to convey the deft emotional complexity of the source material."
On Chesil Beach,"Away from the beach and away from the raw honesty it forces out of its stars, On Chesil Beach heads towards shallow, cold waters."
On Chesil Beach,"It's a lyrical and rapturous film - a repressed passion play, funny, delicate and heartbreaking."
On Chesil Beach,The movie is a muted elegy to emotional waste.
The Party,ERROR
Beast,"There are some great performances here, notably from Copley, but Beast often feels too contrived and preposterously overblown."
Beast,"Audiences will turn up because a trailer promised to show them one of our most charismatic A-listers in a boxing match with a roided-out kitty cat... In that sense, it’s impossible to argue that Beast doesn’t live up to its promise."
Beast,"'Beast' delivers on its simple premise, offering an effective survival thriller; nothing more, nothing less."
Beast,"It’s partly this hint of emotional complexity, plus Elba’s robust redemption arc, from failed father to lion-punching saviour, that sets this picture a notch above the average creature attack flick."
Beast,Beast is a film that knows exactly what it is and doesn’t try to overcomplicate things – it’s a chase film and what you get is a suspenseful chase. Job done.
Beast,The camera work here is really beautiful and the style fits this film very well.
Beast,"The script is the main weakness, loaded with hoary dialogue and sledgehammer-subtle exposition..."
Beast,"Beast doesn’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to animal survival films, but it’s free enough of fat and frills to warrant a watch in the theatrical dog days of summer."
Beast,"The success of this film’s eye-catching, ear-grabbing hocus pocus can be traced back to smart direction, near seamless visual/sound effects, tight editing and the supremely talented Idris Elba."
Beast,"Again, almost the only factor that allows us to take the life-or-death situation even halfway seriously is Elba’s performance."
Beast,Beast is basically Jaws on safari.
Beast,"Whether this was ever intended to be a serious film, I cannot say, but it’s fun in its schlocky, gory, silly way, doesn’t outstay its welcome and will satisfy anyone who has ever yearned to see Idris Elba wrestle a lion and then punch it full in the face."
Beast,"Baltasar Kormákur finesses the tone expertly, delivering a thrill ride that still has warmly likeable characters."
Beast,"An old-fashioned, B-movie creature-feature with some CG gloss. Beast is as predictable as anything but it’s a fun, silly, well-made film about a man punching a big cat."
Beast,"Idris Elba vs a loopy lion. That's a prospect to make all sane viewers salivate, yet by the end of this savannah-set survival thriller I was practically supine. I am woman, hear me snore."
Beast,A grippingly efficient thrill-ride with such a steely fixity of purpose that its 93 minutes seem to pass in around 15.
Beast,"This is Edris' show and if you go into it expecting just to enjoy him, you're going to walk out and you're going to feel like you had a good time."
Beast,"Every scene is built on cinder blocks of tension, but the riotous screenplay is so silly and one-dimensional you find yourself laughing in spite of yourself."
Beast,"When a wiser-than-average thriller can more than adequately supply the dumb thrills we require from our large-screen, air-conditioned entertainments, you know you’ve found the right place to survive these last few dog days of summer."
Beast,"It's August and we have Idris, Beast seems to say; do you really have anywhere better to be?"
Beast,"There are some great performances here, notably from Copley, but Beast often feels too contrived and preposterously overblown."

Beast,"It's August and we have Idris, Beast seems to say; do you really have anywhere better to be?"
Beast,"If any lions watch this movie, they’re bound to regard it as a comedy about the sheer ineptitude of one of their colleagues. Worse, Mr. Kormákur somehow elicits a shoddy performance from the sturdy English actor Idris Elba."
Beast,"If you’ve ever wanted to the man formerly known as Stringer Bell cold-cock the King of the Jungle, Beast is the movie of your dreams."
Beast,Let the jump-scares commence...
Beast,Elba’s commitment to the film gives it more psychological weight than it might deserve. Nothing will surprise you in how Beast unfolds except for how engrossing it manages to be.
Beast,"Yes, it’s all illogical and silly... But if everybody always acted correctly, we wouldn’t have movies like Beast, and that’d be no fun at all."
Beast,"The Orca-like setup instantly sways allegiances in the lion’s favor and follows a straightforward formula, but the care put into its characters and propulsive thrills keep you engaged."
Beast,"I mean, people do stupid things in horror movies all the time, just to get the audience to talk back to the screen, but this is excessive."
Beast,"A diverting pulse-raiser, which has the additional virtue of clocking in at a brisk 93 minutes."
Beast,"As with so much of this director’s work, I’m in the middle on “Beast,” though its efficient running time puts it a notch above."
Beast,If the film is elevated by the great Idris Elba... it nevertheless falls squarely in the camp of formula.
Beast,Think of it as Jaws on Safari and you'll have some idea what to expect from this generic thrill machine that requires Idris Elba to look great (he does) while doing battle with a digital lion.
Beast,"A ludicrous if enjoyable reminder that just because you’ve seen one killer CGI lion, it doesn’t mean you’ve seen them maul."
Beast,"After some early thrills, director Baltasar Kormákur’s movie ceases to excite because the creature has no more surprises left."
Beast,"In the end Beast is, frankly, sort of dumb."
Beast,"The basics are simple and straightforward, making this thriller something of an “animals attack” throwback that goes right for the jugular, with enthusiastic ruthlessness."
Beast,"Ryan Engle's screenplay keeps the story tense while Kormákur's direction stays focused, tight and grounded. ""Beast"" is a monster."
Beast,It’s an edge-of-your-seat crowd-pleaser that cares enough to develop its story world and characters just as well as its jump-scares and tension.
Beast,Idris Elba fights a lion. It’s genius. So why does Beast feel more like a whisper than a roar?
Beast,"Sometime soon, “Beast” will hit the great streaming graveyard. Say a prayer and move on. By that point, you will have heard that it’s a dud."
Beast,"Whether it's the so-so CGI or the threadbare character development, 'Beast' frustratingly refuses to aspire to be more than a competent, disposable actioner."
Beast,"Elba, always a powerful presence in whatever role he takes on, does the best he can in “Beast,” but the threadbare nature of the plotting and dialogue ultimately defeats him."
Beast,"Barrels along seasoned with a visceral fear factor, but not without some ludicrous plotting and dialogue."
Beast,"A thrilling, if throwaway, reminder of the fun to be had while watching a B-movie bringing its A-game."
Beast,"It isn’t Elba’s “Sharknado” but also not exactly his “Out of Africa,” so just enjoy this late-summer flick for what it does well: a primal fight between man and very mad lion that brings unhinged beauty to a rousing “Beast.”"
Beast,"There are thrills to be had here, even if the film doesn’t add up to a satisfying whole."
Beast,"There are far worse ways to spend 93 minutes in a movie theater, but audiences hankering for something with some actual substance may be left feeling hungry on mane."
Beast,"This is cinema as spectacle distilled down to its rawest form, where basic storytelling leads directly to visceral and emotional catharsis."
Beast,"""Beast"" is a crisp, to-the-point 90-minute action-thriller that makes no pretenses to be more than it is. It's as if (director) Kormakur said, ""You want to see a Idris Elba pop a realistically rendered digital lion in the face? I got you."""
Beast,"“Beast” is going through the motions with father-daughter tension. The humans-as-prey tension, that’s a different story."
Schindler’s List,It's clear almost immediately that filmmaker Steven Spielberg is using Schindler's story as a clothesline upon which to hang a more all-encompassing portrait of the Holocaust...
Schindler’s List,.Liam Neeson is imposing and heart wrenching as Schindler and Ralph Fiennes is incendiary as the concentration camp master.
Schindler’s List,"A great film but a tough watch. But after 25 years, some viewers may decide they're ready to see it again."
The Cakemaker,Natural performances from Kalkhof and Adler root the melodrama in genuine pathos.
The Cakemaker,Credit first-time writer/director Ofir Raul Graizer with pulling off something of a miracle.
The Cakemaker,"A tender, tactile and just-sweet-enough story of hidden love, challenged faith and unwittingly shared grief."
The Cakemaker,"Kalkhof has perfect chemistry with both Miller and Adler. The characters don't have to talk for the audience to feel the loss, love and desire they're experiencing."
The Cakemaker,"Graizer take his time and never feels the need to spell everything out, and ""The Cakemaker"" is a testament to what filmmakers can achieve when they trust the audience."
The Cakemaker,"The most fascinating kind of tension results, an unusual state of affairs that plays fair with the characters, and with us."
The Cakemaker,A terrifically impressive feature debut by Israeli writer/director Ofir Raul Graizer.
The Cakemaker,"The Cakemaker is more of a petit four than a belly bomb, but it's striking in its particularity."
The Cakemaker,"Sad and sweet, and with a rare lyricism, ""The Cakemaker"" believes in a love that neither nationality, sexual orientation nor religious belief can deter."
The Cakemaker,"The film binds its narrative to fascinating explorations of national identity, sexuality, and, of course, food."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Cameron - the kind of cool kid who'd use the word ""cool"" with caution - fits Moretz like a glove."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"This exquisite, bittersweet sophomore effort announces Akhavan as a major talent."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Akhavan plays it with poignant wit, zest and a lusty sense of defiance, combining the bonding charms of a brat-pack crowd-pleaser with the psychological terrors of a prom-night horror flick."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"We need more movies like this, where the filmmakers do not judge these young characters - but in which they find strength and support in believing in themselves. It could make all the difference to just one person watching it."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,Oddly enough the narrative ended up being empowering.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Director Desiree Akhavan, who adapted the film from Emily M Danforth's novel, strikes a delicate balance between satire and polemic."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"It's all done beautifully. Witty and funny too, but at a consistent, compassionate pace throughout. A lovely sigh of a movie."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,What a step up for Moretz this is.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,A coming-of-age story which thoughtfully and heartfully tackles the repellent practice of conversion therapy.

The Miseducation of Cameron…,The film feels like one made not just about young people but for them.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"The sharp, irreverent humour recalls the tone of fellow YA hit The Fault In Our Stars and the script steers away from broad strokes or predictable beats."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Smart, amusing and engaging."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"The sort of film that stays with you. Powerful in its restraint, and unfailingly full of light."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,Modest in scale but emotionally raw.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"A unique work that has a lot of fun with its malevolent premise, without undermining the damage that such oppression and repression can cause."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,[Post] is anchored by a strong performance by Chloe Grace Moretz.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,A timid drama with a passive voice that doesn't align with the importance of its subject matter.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,The Miseducation of Cameron Post is a modest-size film that performs a service opposite to that of Conversion therapy: It respects the vulnerability that accompanies the emergence of any young person's sexuality.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"The Miseducation of Cameron Post has flashes of greatness. And I love its empathic exploration of queer youth, especially from a female perspective."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,The Miseducation of Cameron Post is a love letter to the kids who needed it the most.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Akhavan's movie is so many things at once - wise, witty, moving, sexy - that its occasional fumbles in tone and characterization barely register."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"There is a marvelous depth, an underlying layer of benevolence that permeates this story right to its core, Akhavan bringing everything to life with an effortless grace that never feels heavy-handed or didactic."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Akhavan keeps the camera locked on Moretz's face; every time you think she can't possibly go closer, she does. But it's the definition of a female gaze."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"""The Miseducation of Cameron Post"" is a scrapbook made by the people who were there."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"It's loaded with terrific performances all around and, under the skilful stewardship of director Desiree Akhavan, it's a well-crafted story steeped in poignancy, melancholy and simple truths."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,These three musketeers swagger their sarcasm like rapiers wielded in the spirit of a collective self-preservation.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"This is essentially a movie about teenagers stuck in an overly strict summer camp, and watching youths quietly whiling away the hours in a detention center is not exactly scintillating conflict."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"""The Miseducation of Cameron Post"" offers a powerful rejoinder to anyone who'd shame people into denying their authentic selves. In its own modest way, it's one of the year's bravest films."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"""Miseducation"" more often opts for nuance than burlesque, and that is its strength."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"The director has enough faith in her audience to risk making all of the characters complicated, multifaceted and true-to-life."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Moretz' wry smile and weary eyes convey volumes of emotional turmoil. She is the soulful, courageous heart of a film that exalts the strength of human dignity."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Moretz's performance is understated, assured... Watching her watch Desert Hearts to watch her best friend's reaction to it is one of the realest things I've ever seen on-screen."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,A handsomely retrofitted after-school movie.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,The Miseducation of Cameron Post may not hit as hard as it should. But it at least suggests that the only real losers in life are those who presume to read God's mind.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"This is a film about Cameron's core personhood, and how it stands up to concentrated efforts to transform it, and it's told with quiet steeliness and grace."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"But the pervading problem of the movie is that it takes so much of this for granted-all the fraught, interpersonal weirdness between characters, or between the characters and the people who sent them here."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,The film's refusal to produce a campy critique feels more like the product of lack of imagination than a purposeful repudiation.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"An outstanding performance from Moretz, who allows us to observe her as she observes those around her. Neither she nor we are miseducated by the end."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"A sweet indie film in the tradition of John Hughes. Calmly directed by Desiree Akhavan, the movie doesn't get tangled in the weeds of politics, but instead focuses intensely on its lovely characters."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"It's hard to think of a more highly-charged topic than the brainwashing of vulnerable adolescents in the name of God, so it's certainly to Akhavan's credit that she uses such a determinedly understated style."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"The Miseducation of Cameron Post is a sharply observed study - with a knife edge of satire, for sure - of the daily practice of soft tyranny by people not gifted with healthy self-doubt."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Akhavan opts for even-handedness instead of relying on melodrama to raise the film's dramatic stakes. It's an act of tenderness toward her characters, none of which she allows to function as a traditional villain."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Navigating troubled culture-war waters with grace, humor and compassion, ""The Miseducation of Cameron Post"" is a movie that deserves a wide and diverse audience."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Chloë Grace Moretz plays Cameron with such tasteful reserve, all blank stares and slightly agape mouth in the face of the most ardent down-is-up doctrine."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,What a shame that this well-meaning and timely look at the absurdity of gay conversion camps - it won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance this year - lacks the teeth to make its points stick.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Though, [it] packs an emotional punch that's hard to shake. Like a good '90s single, it's the kind of thing that lurks in the back of your brain, ready to resurface with new meaning when you least expect it."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"The film takes a grown-up approach to its young-adult material; this is a somewhat somber YA adaptation, with teenage subjects who are fully formed and all too human."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"This movie may wander, but Akhavan's attention to perfect little moments is unwavering."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,The action is schematic and the characters are thinly sketched.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"A thoughtful if somewhat shapeless drama about the struggle between human instinct and ideology, populated by finely-drawn characters..."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"A clear-eyed examination of a self-assured female gay character from the past, both ahead of her teenage years and the era through which she lived them."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"The repressive setting would be, in a less nuanced film, a site of unadulterated horror. But Cameron, Jane, and Adam, like queer people through the ages, find ways to bond, joke, and help each other through the circumstances."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,[Desiree] Akhavan is a master at balancing the highs and lows of Post's story.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Desiree Akhavan's Sundance-winning drama pulls back the curtain on gay-conversion camps, offering a valuable (albeit simplistic) alternative to self-questioning young viewers."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,The people in this story are flesh-and-blood examples of a tragic emotional Stockholm Syndrome that should not be. I just wish the story did more with them.
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"The wheels are always turning, but the performance is subtle. It is far and away the best thing [Chloe Grace Moretz has] done."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Natural, low-key performances from a cast led by Chloë Grace Moretz highlight a movie that eschews grandstanding - this modest story about self-discovery and community would rather celebrate the small victories against intolerance."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"t beautifully articulates the need for young people to realize the validity of who they are, and even more beautifully crystalizes the moment when that starts to happen."
The Miseducation of Cameron…,"Generously peppered with biting humor and warmed by a generous spirit that extends understanding, if not forgiveness, even to the religious zealot characters."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Ultimately, Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool is an extremely rewarding romantic drama and should appeal even to those unfamiliar with Gloria Grahame"
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"McGuigan's role is essentially to serve the script and the performers, and we can be grateful the project wasn't handed to a director more bent on imposing an authorial stamp."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Bening finds the shattered beauty in Grahame, the tragedy of an ex-star hanging on for dear life to her waning looks and fame that has long since passed her by."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Bening is outstanding as a woman who fears that her fame and beauty are slipping away, and Bell (""Billy Elliot"") brings to his character a heartbreaking vulnerability."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Annette Bening is one of those rare actresses who makes a movie, however otherwise deficient, worth seeing."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"These are full-bodied performances, with Peter's ardency and Gloria's kittenishness signaled in a hungry look, a wag of the eyebrows. Fittingly, the film's best scene needs no words"
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Worth seeing for Bening's brave and touching performance as an actress past her prime.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"If the movie meanders, it's refreshing to see a May-September romance in which May is played by the man for once and where the sex is happy, frank, and frequent."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"The screen romance of Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool may seem as odd as the real-life pairing was, but it's a credit to all concerned that the validity of it is never in doubt."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"The movie never delves that deeply into who Gloria Grahame was, aside from a femme fatale slinking across a black-and-white screen."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Director McGuigan and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh paint Film Stars Don't Die ... in unapologetically sentimental tones.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,There is no escaping the essential flaccidity of the story.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Annette Bening is so good in ""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" that it makes up for a story that's slighter than it should be."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,The central pairing lends it a touching intensity ...
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"What an astounding actress Annette Bening is. And she's at her very best playing Gloria Grahame, a screen siren of the 1940s and 1950s, who faced a health crisis in her final days with the help of a new love (a terrific Jamie Bell)."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Provides scant evidence about why we should care about Grahame to begin with and how her fate was perhaps emblematic of movie sirens both past and present.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Film Stars is no portrait of Grahame; it's a pair of points that barely form a line. No shot in the film dares attempt to communicate more than one idea or emotion at a time.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"The fleshing out of the story feels thin, and sometimes nakedly contrived... Yet the film has moments of surprising grace and tenderness."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Bening's expert runs up and down the emotional register leave no room for doubt about Grahame's charisma even when she's playing her own worst enemy.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Film Stars is a basic biopic that, in spite of its fantastic leads, doesn't leave an impression."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"The reason to pay attention to ""Film Stars Don't Die In Liverpool"" is the reason it got made in the first place: the opportunity it provides to see star Annette Bening in action."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Bening forgoes vanity and digs into the humiliation Grahame felt as she aged out of the vampy roles Hollywood typecast her in. Bell brings a sturdy humanity to Peter ...
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"What the Grahame of Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool is missing in detail, Bening makes up for in affection. Her performance is a kind of rebuke to the arc and tragic Norma Desmond view of aging movie actresses."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Landing lightly on the loneliness of fame and the ravages of aging, ""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" is a fond farewell to a distinctive talent."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,The frequent chronological jumps ... give a sense that the director is assembling a puzzle in which half the pieces are missing.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"A padded wisp of a drama, the first half's evocative mystery gradually giving way to the second half's surface-level reenactments."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Bening - who, let's be real, is about 15 years and eight performances overdue for her own Oscar already - holds the movie in her hands."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"In everything from the score to the costumes and hairstyling, McGuigan seems to think that there's no such thing as too much, a lavishness that just isn't supported by the film's obviously modest budget."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,The film shows no interest in the inner workings of a relationship that's defined by unusual circumstances.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Had the film simply been The Annette Bening Show, we'd certainly have coped. But she's matched every step of the way by Bell, in a flat-out career-best performance achieved so naturally it's a marvel."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"An overwrought score pushes the film into the territory of melodrama, but mostly it works, with tender performances from the two leads."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Brittle and insecure, yet also steely and magnetic, Bening's performance is full of nuance."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"We knew Bening could do sexy, but this is newer terrain for Bell and here he swaggers like a young John Travolta, more than holding his own with this queen of cougars."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"This is essentially held together by the two lead performances. On paper, Bell has the lesser role, but this is his best performance to date... As for Bening, if she doesn't get Oscar-nominated this year, I will eat my hat, and also yours."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,A film that really earns it's epic title and the lush Elvis Costello ballad over the final credits.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Bening's performance is subtle and courageous.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"McGuigan goes for easy wins throughout, doggedly incurious about his own characters, underlining the literal-minded script, repeating entire scenes in case anyone missed the point."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Annette Bening is terrific as the effervescent Grahame but it's [Jamie] Bell who works real magic on a role that would otherwise be an adoring (frequently shirtless) puppy dog.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"It's a classy weepy with some killer dialogue, but Bening is the big sell here. Given one of the juiciest roles of her career, she makes every moment count."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"McGuigan manages to tell a truly touching story without resorting to any superfluous narrative devices. His generosity toward his actors is second to none, giving them just enough melodrama to work with without ever overdoing it."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"'Film Stars' could've been a dull bio-drama, and for fleeting moments, it is (in particular, their cycle of fights and reconciliations gets dreary fast). But Bening's charisma and verve gives the picture a much-needed goose."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,Paul McGuigan's few keyed-up aesthetic flourishes actually prove more than apt to the story of a woman whose life frequently resembled the heated movie melodramas that made her name.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"First rate performances from the two leads, and a fine supporting cast, confirms this as an awards season contender."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" is a tawdrier, more tragic, but similarly superficial ""My Week with Marilyn,"" devoted to the dying days of an actress who always lived in Monroe's voluptuous shadow."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Over-production-designed as the film is, Bening and Bell manage to hold their own within it."
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,It's a beguiling story and Bell and Bening are tremendous as the star-crossed lovers.
Film Stars Don’t Die in Liv…,"Despite a few quibbles that viewers may have, there is no denying the emotional force that this film develops, and for that, we can credit talented filmmakers and two stars working at the height of their powers."
Lean on Pete,"This is a film that succeeds in holding all its elements in balance - and in doing so, arrives at a depth of feeling that isn't commonplace at all."
Lean on Pete,"And as the film enters into its final third, Plummer is steady and brilliant demonstrating not only Charley's growth, but also how his naivety becomes mixed with darkness."
Lean on Pete,"For all its sometimes over-episodic structure, Haigh has crafted a quietly affecting coming-of-age journey tale sustained by a central performance that never feels forced or contrived."
Lean on Pete,"A performance of remarkable depth, candour and vulnerability by rising star Charlie Plummer lies at the heart of this terrifically moving fourth feature film from British writer-director Andrew Haigh."
Lean on Pete,Haigh's new film has the substance and emotional heft to be considered a masterpiece.
Lean on Pete,An unvarnished fable that falls somewhere between The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Grapes of Wrath.
Lean on Pete,Rising star Charlie Plummer is mesmerizing...
Lean on Pete,"Plummer gives an excellent performance: watchful, sensitive, delicate and yet possessed of a survivor's impassive quality."
Lean on Pete,This may not be Andrew Haigh's best film. But its slow-burning authenticity suggests a versatility to go with his acuity for credible characters in recognisable situations.
Lean on Pete,"In the second half of the film, the improbabilities mount and sentimentality creeps in. This, though, is still powerful and poignant filmmaking."
Lean on Pete,"Lean on Pete can feel like Dickens, under a starry and menacing American sky."
Lean on Pete,"Throughout, Plummer is mesmerizing, his sunken eyes and gaunt face telling of the layers of hardships Charley is forced to endure."
Lean on Pete,"""Lean on Pete"" demands a different kind of attention from moviegoers. But the rewards are worth it."
Lean on Pete,"The film is a showcase for a very promising young actor named Charlie Plummer. Lanky, sensitive but assured, Plummer gives his character, 15-year-old Charley, a sense of raw decency maintained through trying circumstances."
Lean on Pete,Lean on Pete achieves a visual elegance that grows more expansive and expressive as it goes along.
Lean on Pete,There is a disquieting sense that the director has fallen prey to the poetics of space at the expense of the lives within it.
Lean on Pete,It's hard to imagine anyone watching Lean on Pete and not rooting hard for Charley's wish to come true.
Lean on Pete,"It takes place in a world films rarely show, one where the crusty mentor lacks a heart of gold and where country music plays in every diner, but the people eating there are hard, not homespun."
Lean on Pete,"The words in his new film are pungent in themselves, but they're given greater power by Mr. Plummer's remarkable performance."
Lean on Pete,Plummer's understated intensity seizes our attention and holds it.
Lean on Pete,Lean on Pete becomes a sort of American odyssey.
Lean on Pete,"This is a tough movie to shake, and while it believes in the kindness of strangers, ""Lean on Pete"" never forgets every other human failing, impulse and circumstance."
Lean on Pete,"What sustains the movie - and Charley, and the audience - is its faith in the essential innocence of people, even as Haigh looks coolly at the damage they've suffered and the damage they inflict."
Lean on Pete,At the center of this oddly riveting little picaresque is a performance of such quiet power by Plummer - as an antihero both rash and precociously resourceful - that it's easy to overlook the film's flaws.
Lean on Pete,"This is not a movie about a boy and his horse. It is something far more grueling and merciless, and as the film reveals itself in an increasingly jaw-dropping series of vignettes, it's likely to leave you in tatters."
Lean on Pete,"At his best, [Haigh] can strike more emotional notes from silence than most directors can with a full chorus of sound."
Lean on Pete,"In the hands of British filmmaker Andrew Haigh, this tale of a troubled teen (an extraordinary Charlie Plummer) bonding with a horse becomes a heartbreaking look at a marginalized America."
Lean on Pete,"There is painfully little love, except for the warm and compassionate filmmaking itself, in Andrew Haigh's tender and heartbreaking coming-of-age drama Lean on Pete."
Lean on Pete,As its scenario goes from sad to worse...the movie seems to aspire only to bumming everybody out.
Lean on Pete,"When it's at its subtlest, Lean on Pete sings with power; but when things get outwardly grim, it loses a little of its impact."
Lean on Pete,"Charlie Plummer, last seen as the kidnappee in All the Money in the World, has a naïf-ish quality and a perilously open face."
Lean on Pete,"Tear ducts, saddle up."
Lean on Pete,"A very fine movie that I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it, partly because stories about forgotten and mistreated children tend to be reserved for documentaries and foreign-language art cinema."
Lean on Pete,Lean on Pete flows with such gentle beauty that it may be hard to grasp precisely what it's about or where it's going. But the power of this sublime drama is that it can support myriad interpretations while remaining teasingly mysterious.
Lean on Pete,"By the end, in its painstakingly observational way, Lean on Pete had devastated me twice and hung me there in a state of tense uncertainty for thirty or forty minutes."
Lean on Pete,"A raw-boned, melancholic mood piece that trades in none of the easy inspiration its poster and trailer might suggest."
Lean on Pete,"The story drifts with Charley, in and out of peril, and becomes a doleful picaresque; as his face grows hollow and besmirched, we desperately want him to survive."
Lean on Pete,"As sharply as it delineates an America of spotty, informal economies, the film avoids articulating most of the people who live and work in these spaces."
Lean on Pete,"Again and again, I marveled at the humanist depth of the world Haigh creates, one that can only be rendered by a truly great writer and director, working near the top of his game."
Lean on Pete,"[Charlie Plummer's] character takes your breath away, he's so cowed by the world of the working poor, yet so clearly a potential heroic archetype that his character, Charley, silts itself in your mind long after the final images fade off the screen."
Lean on Pete,"Plummer's performance is remarkably interior, bottled up behind his brimming wide eyes, and Haigh leaves enough space for the emotional weight of all that Charley is forced to process."
Lean on Pete,"The film, adapted by Andrew Haigh from Willy Vlautin's 2010 novel, has an urgency for epic things to happen to its main character in the most literal sense."
Lean on Pete,"'Lean on Pete' is a good old-fashioned boy-and-his-horse story, wandering through a series vignettes - each with the inner life and rich characters of a McMurtry short story, each with their own pleasures and curveballs."
Lean on Pete,"Haigh's storytelling is fittingly economical-he doesn't waste a shot, a line of dialogue, an opportunity for a telling detail. His characters, after all, can't afford to waste anything."
Lean on Pete,"Adapted from a novel by Willy Vlautin, the film is luminously shot and acted, and, for the most, part beautifully controlled ..."
Lean on Pete,"""Lean on Pete"" is a small gem that covers a vast amount of territory."
Lean on Pete,Haigh has rearranged the building blocks of mawkish teen melodrama into a bracing and bittersweet coming-of-age fable.
Lean on Pete,"There's tragedy here, but what's most winning about Lean on Pete is how Haigh never lingers on misery. He's as interested in surprising kindnesses and the goodness of most folks as he is in life's knocks."
Lean on Pete,A standout performance from Plummer makes this thoughtful drama swing.
Lean on Pete,"If this story of a lonely young life lived on the hoof leaves us craving stillness and closeness, then surely that's mission accomplished."
Lean on Pete,"It's particularly refreshing, for those of us for whom the term ""horse movie"" summons a bit of a shudder, that ""Lean On Pete"" almost entirely refutes the idea of the mystical, mutually redemptive soul-mate-style connection between human and equine."
Lean on Pete,There's a wistful quality to the storytelling which softens some of the sharper edges of tragedy and hardship in this undeniably affecting picture.
Lean on Pete,"What reads on the surface like an archetypal tale of a boy and his horse becomes an affecting snapshot of the contemporary American underclass in Andrew Haigh's lovely, slow-burning drama, Lean on Pete."
Lean on Pete,"Charlie Plummer, 18 playing 15, with the looks of a teenage Christopher Walken, brings great presence to Charley - and we're rooting for him all the way."
Lean on Pete,"Haigh's film is never less than heartfelt and affecting. It cares deeply for Charlie and hopes we do, too."
Lean on Pete,"It's frustrating to watch, but designed in such a way that the boy's loneliness will haunt long afterward."
Lean on Pete,"The maker of such intimate dramas as Weekend and 45 Years brings his gifts as a filmmaker with him to the great outdoors, always capturing little moments of character and emotion even in an expanse of seemingly infinite American desert."
Beautifully Broken,An intelligently inspiring faith-based drama that links the fates of families in Rwanda and Nashville.
The Seagull,"One wishes that the film, which clocks in at a brisk 98 minutes, had slowed down and given the actors a bit more space. Even if the complicated brew of emotions cannot always match Chekhov's, there are still moments of great power here."
The Seagull,"Bening, who has developed into an acting bird of Streep-like plumage, enjoys herself enormously as Arkadina."
The Seagull,"The new version, by director Michael Meyer, is far more successful in catching the elusive atmosphere of the Russian master's work."
The Seagull,"Whatever their flaws, all of these characters are looked on with affection and sympathy - in true Chekhov style. In the end, even Irina gets her reflective moment - a hint that she may be capable of feeling for someone other than herself, after all."
The Seagull,This isn't a movie. It's tonal warfare.
The Seagull,"We are left with the sense of a story that has been co-opted into the same accessible, middlebrow terrain that Chekhov was originally reacting against."
The Seagull,"Annette Bening is wonderfully haughty as Irina, the celebrated actor, visiting the family estate."
The Seagull,"A compelling adaptation of a true classic, with nuanced performances and artful direction this is an utter joy."
The Seagull,If the finale does flirt with tragedy...the aftertaste is refreshingly sardonic.
The Seagull,"As comedy, as tragedy, or as anything much in between, Chekhov's drama obstinately refuses to come to life."
The Seagull,"This adaptation of Anton Chekhov's play is handsomely mounted, as they say, and features a stellar cast, but it won't be setting the world alight."
The Seagull,Chekhov is notoriously difficult to film and this adaptation boldly taps into the play's mordant wit. But the fidgety and over-emphatic visuals detract from the themes and the stellar performances.
The Seagull,"None of the actors is less than poised, and Mayer delivers cinematic snap, making everything look velveteen, moving events along at pace."
The Seagull,"Individual performances are great, but the finished product is uninspiring."
The Seagull,Mayer brings a labored hand to the proceedings and can't maximize his dynamite cast or the potential for salaciousness in Chekov's tangled web of characters.
The Seagull,Chekhov would be appalled.
The Seagull,[Director Mayer] soon finds his footing and occasionally reveals something heartbreakingly genuine for contemporary moviegoers in the myriad complicated relationships comprising Chekhov's insulated world.
The Seagull,"At times you feel like you're watching bits and pieces of two or three different films. Happily, they're all pretty good ones."
The Seagull,A story full of passion and longing and rage and betrayal that comes across as abstract verging on bloodless.
The Seagull,"Great, thoughtful acting can take you only so far, and ""The Seagull"" has been brought into close-up without ever coming into focus."
The Seagull,"The best reason to check out the film is for Saoirse Ronan's tender, wrenching performance as the lovelorn Nina, and, especially, for Annette Bening's fantastic turn as Irina..."
The Seagull,"Everyone is unhappy, almost exhaustingly so, but the casting here is exquisite, and the performances are equal to the themes of class warfare, artistic defiance, and familial disappointment in Chekhov's play."
The Seagull,"The Seagull is the story of beautiful people living in luxury, dealing with their unhappiness in a way that leaves others (and, by extension, the audience) just as miserable as they are."
The Seagull,"Bening and Stoll, in particular, find all the wit, vanity, vulnerability and casual cruelty there is to be found here."
The Seagull,"If nothing else, the movie is a double tour de force of acting."
The Seagull,"All in all, this ""Seagull"" will do until the right one comes along."
The Seagull,"They have pruned, or purged, the drama until it runs just over an hour and a half, and, in so doing, mislaid its nervous languor."
The Seagull,"When director Michael Mayer lets his restless camera stay out of the way, Annette Bening, Saoirse Ronan and Elisabeth Moss lift this Chekhov adaptation to the heights."
The Seagull,"The Seagull is handsomely mounted and well-acted by a stellar cast, but it's one of those theatrical adaptations that has no reason to exist for any viewer who can recall a superior stage version of the same work."
The Seagull,"As film, the results are often fabulous."
The Seagull,"The Seagull, true to its author, turns life into art that's bold enough to ask, ""How shall we live?"" and brave enough to answer, ""With great difficulty."""
The Seagull,"It captures the true sense of humanism at the very soul of the story, which reflects both the lightness and the true darkness of life."
The Seagull,The most impressive thing about this film of The Seagull is that every role has been ideally cast.
The Seagull,"As period dramas go, this one feels a little stiff and staid."
The Seagull,This Seagull...has much to recommend.
The Seagull,"For a distinctly Russian play, he's made a notably American film, pleasantly unstuffy."
The Seagull,"The cast is great. The play is great. But this is still a bad movie, because it has no clear or coherent idea of how to be one."
The Seagull,"An enticing, amusing and passionate showcase for its top-drawer cast led by a once-again superb Annette Bening."
The Seagull,The film will appeal mostly to theater buffs curious to see these particular actors in the roles.
The Seagull,"The true magic of the film lies in its performances. Bening is the best she's ever been as the vain, aging stage actress, with a perfectly naïve Ronan as Nina just discovering her sexual power."
The Seagull,"Michael Mayer's film adaptation, while certainly reverential to Chekhov's classic, feels utterly conventional in today's cinematic landscape."
The Seagull,"As a showcase for this otherwise ace cast, [The Seagull] can't be beat."
The Seagull,Brisk and funny
The Seagull,"The Seagull is both laugh out loud hilarious and tragically sad, sometimes in the same scene"
The Seagull,When [Saoirse] Ronan's face appears for the first time it is a glowing orb that fills the screen. She seems to emit sunshine from inside her white dress.
The Seagull,Arkadina is one of literature's most narcissistic mothers - which is saying something - and yet Bening makes her damnably human.
The Seagull,"Theater lovers will enjoy seeing these actors take on such iconic roles, but they'll find themselves wishing they were seeing the same great talent on the stage."
The Seagull,"You can feel the heat, temperature and otherwise, in Michael Mayer's sultry screen adaptation of Anton Chekhov's classic 1896 play."
The Seagull,"Bening has played so many high-intensity mothers by now, you'd think she'd have exhausted her resources. But she's a firecracker in Michael Mayer's spirited adaptation of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, as the aging, boastful actress Irina."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Joaquin Phoenix gives a rollicking performance as Callahan.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","If Phoenix doesn't generate much humor, he also acts as an astringent against the potent sentimentality of Callahan's Saul-to-Paul transformation and pilgrimage of apology, underlined by a heart-tugging Danny Elfman score."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Basically, you can't take your eyes off Hill. And you get the feeling that Phoenix can't either. That gravitational pull is exactly right for the story."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",The picture just about gets by on the sharp interplay between [its] characters. But it finds nowhere interesting to go after a busy first hour.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",[The film] avoids all slick and easy sympathy votes and instead dwells exclusively in the difficult and vigorous mess of a human life on the edge.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","A return to form for Van Sant, and a tour de force performance from Phoenix."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Phoenix and Hill are great, though it's all a bit warm and fuzzy."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Van Sant never strays far from the man-overcomes-disability genre, but this is more than made up for by some impressive directorial flourishes and an engaging central performance."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Ultimately, the film functions the same way these cartoons do, through exaggeration and metaphor."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","The film's main problem is one of excessive length. Intriguing as it is, some judicious pruning would have made it a whole lot better."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Based on the autobiography of John Callahan, controversial cartoonist, quadriplegic, and recovering alcoholic, it's a story that should be rich in content, but often falters from weak character development."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Gus Van Sant's biopic about a self-made artist brims with hard-won wisdom and terrific performances from unlikely actors.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","It is Phoenix, almost all on his own, who makes Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot something bordering on essential."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Can one wan directing job mute the sheer performance power of Joaquin Phoenix? The answer, of course, is no. Not this time, at least."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",The film sings with creativity and a feel-good '70s vibe and some fantastic dark humor.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Cartoonist John Callahan is given an appropriately unorthodox remembrance in Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot, an off-kilter biopic about an off-kilter guy."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Leave it to filmmaker Gus Van Sant to make a film about a hopeless drunk who becomes a quadriplegic into a story that's funny, dark, sad, sweet and even sort of inspirational."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","""Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot"" sometimes plays more like an acting class than a proper movie. But with acting this good it's difficult to complain. Much."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","It's hardly the worst movie of the year-Van Sant is too competent a filmmaker for that, even now-but it's frustrating for how dashed-off every element seems."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",It's really Phoenix that binds the whole piece together.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Joaquin Phoenix and director Gus Van Sant turn a biopic of quadriplegic cartoonist John Callahan into something tender, unique."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","There's a truth to life in that shagginess, let alone a life as unusual as Callahan's. But it does make it hard for ""Don't Worry"" to hang together."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","""Don't Worry"" tries to find a compelling point or purpose, but it never quite does."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","There's a sense of disjointedness to the entire affair, as if Van Sant can't seem to figure out whether he wants to tell a story about addiction or a story about disability; Lord knows he doesn't see any way to bridge the two."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",[Phoenix's] interactions with Jonah Hill as his sponsor are really true and kind of heartbreaking.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","The dark story didn't need to be sanded down for a Hollywood ending, but after the pain and loss he endures, the little bit of peace he earns while finding his voice is both hard-fought and satisfying."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",A movie that's supposed to inspire winds up being irritating instead.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","A movie about that most essential thing in life: finding your people, even when you don't know who you are yourself."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","By the end, it seems to have slowed and swelled into one triumphant act of therapy-Good John Hunting."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","It's a bit like watching one of those DVD bonus features consisting of a bunch of deleted scenes all strung together, except that many of these scenes are much too strong to have ever been deleted."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","It's not Van Sant's most tightly crafted story, but it's a compassionate saga of the Sisyphean task of sobriety."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","As an addiction memoir, it works well enough; there are a handful of deeply felt moments..."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Van Sant the screenwriter does a disservice to the material by constantly chopping up narrative strands into bite-size chunks and later circling back to key incidents.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Although Van Sant uses humor to avoid the pitfalls of a schmaltzy Lifetime movie recovery story, he still seems afraid to confront Callahan as an artist, and a person, in any meaningful way."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Joaquin Phoenix gives another incredible performance in this excellent new film from Gus Van Sant. The actor is a true chameleon and always believable.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Van Sant pays tribute to the restorative power of faith, discipline and perseverance, but he also resists the temptation to follow these themes into an overly pat or complacent groove."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Though the director and his sterling cast seem to get all the biographical details right, the soul is somehow missing."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","If there's one thing that Van Sant does very well here, it's creating a humanizing anchor at the center of the story."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Staggering between corny conventionality and zesty, upbeat weirdness, ""Don't Worry"" never fully acknowledges the cruelty and selfishness required to sustain a longtime habit."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Non-linearity is used to mirror the backsliding volatility of Callahan's recovery, but it's a gimmick that only feigns narrative unpredictability."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","The result is always entertaining, at times life-enhancing."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Hill is good, finding a sincere wavelength for his role which doesn't push Donnie at us too mockingly: he's this film's equivalent of Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Van Sant's film is fascinating for many reasons.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Mara is an actress who deserves far more than to be arm candy.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","The film is disarming for its sincerity, unalloyed in its positive thinking but unafraid of showing the gruesome details of alcoholism and denial to back up its bromides."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Nothing in the story really sticks; amid endless iterations of AA meetings ... it's left to Callahan's scabrous cartoons to remind us just how dark his humour was.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","The movie falls short of deep insights, but its most prominent qualities - scrappy, ephemeral, a little bit lewd - mirror the chief attributes of Callahan's endearing work."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…","Phoenix tends to get lost in his parts, which can lead him (along with his films) astray. But when his high-wire emotional arc suits the movie, there are few who can touch him."
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Don't Worry isn't some tearfully inspirational tribute to Callahan's triumph over his disability. It's a tearfully inspirational tribute to his triumph over alcoholism.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",A life-affirming sweet-and-sour concoction ...
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",This unwieldy but consistently enjoyable portrait of paraplegic local hero John Callahan is notable for its generosity of spirit and gentleness.
"Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get F…",Distractingly disjointed
The Bookshop,Fitzgerald's book about the ruthlessness and resolve that can be glimpsed underneath apparent graciousness and courtesy is brought to the screen by Isabel Coixet with outstanding performances by Patricia Clarkson and Emily Mortimer.
The Bookshop,The ever-winsome Emily Mortimer glows as a struggling widow who opens a bookstore in her insular coastal town.
The Bookshop,"The Bookshop is a gentle, quiet film in which not a whole lot happens... But it's beautifully evocative of the musty, inviting smell of a bookshop on a cool day, or of the nostalgic pleasure of old photographs"
The Bookshop,Hang a CLOSED sign in the window: it's another film with a strong female character that's cushioned in the safety and comfort of the recent past.
The Bookshop,"For a movie that is about a collection of oddballs, it can sometimes feel rather generic. But at its core, the film is not a comedy at all. The eccentricities issue from real adversity."
The Bookshop,It's a heavy-handed version of small-town rebellion that devastates any trace of subtlety like a heft tome smashing an errant spider.
The Bookshop,"""The Bookshop"" isn't an especially good film, but there's no shortage of good in it."
The Bookshop,"It's a strange film: small, sad (without being tragic) and yet sweet without being syrupy."
The Bookshop,"A film that makes itself so predictable can only overcome this obstacle through atmosphere, performance, and abundance of charm or style. The Bookshop has some of those qualities but not enough, sorry to say"
The Bookshop,"I don't know how anyone thought this was still relevant now, because it's such an obvious idea."
The Bookshop,"[Isabel Coixet's] movies tend to be a little on the safe and vague side, and I think this movie falls into both of these traps."
The Bookshop,A particular letdown for fans of period British drama.
The Bookshop,"Coixet has a lyrical sense of place, and she has made a charming, well-acted adaptation that ably conjures visual pleasure out of the written word..."
The Bookshop,"Despite its flaws, the film possesses such a clear passion and advocacy for writing, knowledge and personal expression that it emerges as a largely worthy and poignant accomplishment..."
The Bookshop,"As cleanly appointed and precise as Penelope Fitzgerald's prose, ""The Bookshop,"" based on Fitzgerald's 1978 novel, seems very much a fable."
The Bookshop,"Ms. Coixet highlights the undertow of subtle savagery in her genteel material, giving its picturesque setting - an English coastal village in 1959 - a more sinister, cynical cast."
The Bookshop,"Sometimes nice to be reminded of violence of the papercut variety, that some troubles can be worked through without an ass-kicking."
The Bookshop,Writer-director Isabel Coixet's intermittent visual flourishes do little to amplify the stakes of her low-key narrative.
The Bookshop,"It's memorable for its subtle unconventionality - sad without being a weepy, touching without being a romance."
The Bookshop,"It is a strange, subdued, rather miserable film, interestingly perceptive on conformism and philistinism as a way of life, and on the disconcerting wiles the inhabitants use in order to thwart Florence's entirely reasonable plans."
The Bookshop,"It's staggeringly inept, like an am-dram in a Berlitz language class."
The Bookshop,"At times, it may seem off-key but there is an irony and originality here that you wouldn't find if a British director had been calling the shots."
The Bookshop,"[Isabel] Coixet has no trouble with her theme, which is centred on the power of ideas and the books that contain them."
The Bookshop,"I had real problems with her adaptation. It's hard to describe exactly why it fails to ring true, but somehow it just seems phony."
The Bookshop,"Coixet's script is a long way off perfect, but it's the least of her problems; the second least is the film's dirge of a score, but even that's a bummer."
The Bookshop,"Coixet's comfortable approach to Fitzgerald's material rarely rises above a simmer, favouring polite conversations laced with passive-aggressive intent."
The Bookshop,It doesn't help that the film is pulverised by wall-to-wall narration.
The Bookshop,"A fine, sensitive leading turn from Emily Mortimer helps shore up these quiet, lightly dust-covered proceedings, but can't quite put ""The Bookshop"" in the black."
The Bookshop,"Its subversive undercurrent, embodied in fine performances by Emily Mortimer and Bill Nighy, is what makes it really interesting."
The Front Runner,"The Front Runner's timidity extends even to the portrayal of Hart himself... the film instead allows him to recede into the background, leaving Jackman and his trademark charisma with very little to do."
The Front Runner,"Most fascinating is the film's subtext that the blame for our present cultural morass doesn't rest solely with politicians or the media; in a way, they're only gladiators, thrashing to amuse an enervated citizenry that demands entertainment 24/7."
The Front Runner,The Front Runner is commendably even-handed in its portrayal of both the political system and the fourth estate. And Jackman's commanding performance should be required viewing.
The Front Runner,A misguided defence of a man and an attitude that feels particularly ludicrous in 2019.
The Front Runner,It's a bit of a shoulder shrug in the end... it lacked a dramatic blow.
The Front Runner,"The film, initially zippy (mostly thanks to J K Simmons as Hart's seen-it-all spin doctor), soon turns into a self-righteous mess."
The Front Runner,"To a score of battle drums, Reitman rattles through a montage of behind-the-scenes strategising. There's a thrilling charge to the film-making."
The Front Runner,"It was a good move to have Hart played by Hugh Jackman, although the actor also does a fine job of conveying his intellect, wit and great hair."
The Front Runner,Effectively captures the knife-edge bustle of political stagecraft.
The Front Runner,"Shares intriguing intersections with All the President's Men, The Post and The Candidate, the pacy chatter is never less than compelling, and there are lovely supporting turns."
The Front Runner,Not Reitman's most exciting work but still a watchable political thriller.
The Front Runner,[A] clotted and evasive movie...
The Front Runner,"Perhaps Hart was a great lost leader, possibly a dodged bullet. Difficult to tell. Maybe he was set up, or a serial misuser of power over women. Who can say? Not this oddly fuzzy film."
The Front Runner,"Move along, nothing to see here."
The Front Runner,"A sharp-witted and wide-reaching account of a bright political hope's fall from grace, with an impressive ensemble cast and a great performance from Jackman."
The Front Runner,As played by an aloof Hugh Jackman - the Australian actor affects an uneven accent - Hart is little more than a cipher.
The Front Runner,It can all feel more like a history lesson than it does a dramatic narrative endeavor...
The Front Runner,"There's an argument in the film about what is interesting and what is important, and how the two should be weighed. In that spirit, ""The Front Runner"" is interesting, but it's not weighty or assured enough to be important."
The Front Runner,"Reitman is good at posing questions for which he doesn't have answers and, although that makes for compelling drama, the results feel incomplete and frustrating."
The Front Runner,"""The Front Runner"" doesn't hit us over the head with parallels to today's political and media world. It doesn't have to."
The Front Runner,"People answer in punchlines here, and leave it to director Reitman to always lead with irony."
The Front Runner,"The strength of ""The Front Runner"" is that it's an ensemble piece in which we get to know a lot of players in the press, the campaign, and elsewhere."
The Front Runner,"Reitman is very close to making The Front Runner into a clear winner, but like Hart, he falls just short."
The Front Runner,"The movie is better at showing Rice (Sara Paxton) as a woman trampled by the press stampede - ditto Hart's wife Lee, played elegantly by Farmiga."
The Front Runner,"Vera Farmiga plays Hart's wife Lee, brilliantly bringing home in just a few scenes the personal cost of a spouse's betrayal."
The Front Runner,"A near-miss, but a miss all the same."
The Front Runner,"The movie ultimately feels exhausting, raising issues it doesn't have the energy to address (about morality, the role of journalists, the public's right to know) and presenting a wide-eyed Rice as a lamb led to slaughter."
The Front Runner,"The filmmakers put Hart's story squarely in the context of the present, when the norms and traditions that were evolving in 1987 now seem like the quaint artifacts of an era supplanted by a vicious double helix of personal destruction and shamelessness."
The Front Runner,"The film is so desperate to come off like a wry, coffee-stained media satire (à la Robert Altman's classic HBO series Tanner '88) that it misses the deeper story, that of a woman being treated shabbily on a man's way to the top."
The Front Runner,"This is a responsible, educated, sophisticated and often deeply witty film about politics and journalistic responsibility in the tradition of All the President's Men, The Post and The Ides of March."
The Front Runner,"Jackman, sporting a distracting, Hart-like brown hairpiece, seems miscast. He doesn't convincingly convey this politician's swagger and slickness, and Reitman's attempts to mimic a loose-limbed political movie... are rather leaden."
The Front Runner,Reitman is tripped up in his attempts to spin Hart's story into something more symbolic.
The Front Runner,"The issue of how men in power treat women brings the film into the here and now all the more robustly, but the tone is hectoring and opportunistic, with none of the true pop of American politics."
The Front Runner,"Given the profound currents and countercurrents that have transformed-and menaced-the news media in the last few years, this story plays like quaintly ancient history."
The Front Runner,"""The Front Runner"" comes along at a particularly relevant time in American political history."
The Front Runner,"The Front Runner is appropriately paced like a thriller, as everyone involved gets pulled down into the drain, helplessly."
The Front Runner,The film quickly reveals that the only angle it's interested in is the one that most sympathizes Gary Hart.
The Front Runner,"In 1988, Gary Hart's promising presidential candidacy fizzled out. Perhaps it's only fitting that his movie follows suit."
The Front Runner,The Front Runner is at its best when showing the inner workings of the Hart campaign as it attempts to handle the revelations.
The Front Runner,"It's an understated film with enough smarts, unlike its protagonist, to overcome its shortcomings and deliver a winning ticket."
The Front Runner,[Reitman's] missing both key insight and satirical bite in his depiction of this pivotal point in American history.
The Front Runner,Jackman excels as a deeply flawed hero in this drama about a bygone political era.
The Front Runner,"A fun, endlessly fascinating watch in which the big questions outweigh the tiny problem."
The Front Runner,It's a feature-length whine of frustrated entitlement. A movie less suited to its cultural moment would be hard to imagine.
The Front Runner,"A tip-top piece of entertainment starring Hugh Jackman as Hart and Vera Farmiga as his wife, Lee, that is as significant as it is enjoyable."
The Front Runner,"Reitman has still made an interesting film. It's just that, from this vantage point, everyone in it seems snared in such obvious entropy."
The Front Runner,Reitman rewinds to that 1988 moment when Gary Hart's adultery took presidential politics tabloid. But not even Hugh Jackman as Hart can sell the argument that personal weakness doesn't stain public character in the era of #MeToo.
The Front Runner,"The film excites our curiosity about Hart's behavior and then declares it to be none of our business. It scolds rather than illuminates, and prefers the defense of power to the pursuit of truth."
The Front Runner,"So why does it stop short of feeling like a necessary slice of turning-point history, and more like something you think ""nice job"" about? Perhaps because in giving the jump-around view, the effect is of a scandal skimmed, rather than explored."
The Front Runner,"Hart is played in the film by Hugh Jackman, or, rather, by a brave dialectical struggle between the actor and his wig. By a hair's breadth, the actor wins."
The Front Runner,You've heard of an October surprise. This is a November disappointment.
The Front Runner,"Whether you've been following politics for three years or 30, you'll learn something from The Front Runner-but buckle up, because it's gonna hurt."
The Front Runner,"Jackman and Reitman shine in a top quality political thriller, with a finely-tuned exploration of integrity in changing times."
The Front Runner,"Hubris is not enough of a reason for audiences to flock to this film, though Jackman's performance may be."
The Front Runner,"The Front Runner, Jason Reitman's dramatization of the three-week rise and fall of Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign, works best in its first half, as fleet-footed, wisecracking campaign/newsroom comedy/drama."
The Front Runner,"Reitman mistakes glibly cornering all sides of the argument for complexity, on top of which some unfortunate writing and directing decisions make it seem like Hart was more of a victim."
The Front Runner,"[The Front Runner] has a lot on its mind... but spends too little energy dissecting those thoughts. Instead, we're mostly treated to a parade of wonderful character actors making witty proclamations that then immediately fade into the atmosphere."
The Front Runner,"Someone had to make a movie about Gary Hart eventually, and so here it is."
The Front Runner,There's an authenticity underpinning the portrayal of events in The Front Runner that lifts it above the less-than-groundbreaking set-up.
The Front Runner,"The strong and sprawling supporting cast gives the movie its snap, crackle, and pop, and its sharpest observations. But too often even that snap, crackle, and pop feels like it's been sitting in a bowl of milk too long."
The Front Runner,"The film is broadly sympathetic of Hart's situation; it doesn't absolve him of being a shitty husband, but it side-eyes the press for whipping the story into a national firestorm."
The Front Runner,"It doesn't tell us how we should feel or pretend to know all the answers. For some, that might be frustrating, but ""The Front Runner"" delivers more than enough provocative material to make it a wild, occasionally hopeful, often depressing ride."
The Front Runner,"The ""Juno"" director's got his groove back."
The Front Runner,"Given the limitations of the role, Jackman delivers one of his finest performances."
Puzzle,"In case you were wondering, the jigsaw puzzles are a metaphor for the wife's identity."
Puzzle,"Always strong in supporting roles, Macdonald achieves her own mid-career breakthrough with a fascinatingly complex lead performance that pitches natural inhibition against a growing inner confidence."
Puzzle,"Lovely, subtle work from Macdonald, as her character blossoms and her horizons broaden, gives the film a warmth and magnetism."
Puzzle,What's to dislike here? Hardly anything - it's finding things actively to like that poses more of a problem.
Puzzle,"Terribly earnest, but that's not really enough."
Puzzle,"It might look like a quirky take on the sports movie, but Puzzle is in fact an astutely crafted character drama, featuring a superb central performance from Kelly Macdonald."
Puzzle,"Turtletaub's direction and the trio of ace performances make ""Puzzle"" feel relatable and real; it's one of those movies where everything truly comes together."
Puzzle,"The intricacies of Puzzle may not fully occupy the viewer's mind, but the film passes muster as a diverting pastime."
Puzzle,"I found it impossible not to be caught up in this story, especially considering just how rare it is to see a film about a forty-something woman like this one told with such restraint and attention to detail."
Puzzle,Watching two people do a jigsaw puzzle could be fascinating in the right movie. This is not that movie.
Puzzle,"""Puzzle"" becomes a low-key pleasure, with all its pieces fitting together nicely."
Puzzle,"The results are deceptively simple, finding complex emotions in a scenario that only signals sentimentality."
Puzzle,"Turtletaub goes deep on character, allowing Macdonald and Khan to reveal details of their lives, and also their dreams and fears, in a manner that's as natural as the charming piano score."
Puzzle,"The indie drama's aptly metaphorical goings-on have real warmth, and get an added boost from charming performances by Macdonald and Irrfan Khan..."
Puzzle,It's entirely possible that sending the audience out feeling lousy was intentional.
Puzzle,How wonderful it is to see this fine actress carry a film and carry it so beautifully.
Puzzle,"Wry, gentle and quietly radical."
Puzzle,"Macdonald is so good, on her own or with a scene partner, director Marc Turtletaub's movie refuses to fall apart."
Puzzle,"In ""Puzzle,"" Macdonald has finally found a movie that she doesn't need to steal, because it belongs to her completely."
Puzzle,"The acting is uniformly good, but Macdonald is excellent. She captures the frustrations Agnes didn't even know she had, and her performance is authentic throughout."
Puzzle,"In truth, there is barely enough story here to make a film. Yet the play of emotions on Macdonald's face tells of worries and wounds much deeper than anything that can be accounted for in the script..."
Puzzle,"I'm an unabashed Kelly Macdonald fan. If you share my admiration for her, Puzzle is a must-see."
Puzzle,Puzzle touched me profoundly.
Puzzle,The most refreshing thing about Puzzle is that it's an adult movie about characters and their low-key circumstances.
Puzzle,"A million tiny revelations make up one massive arc, and Kelly Macdonald positively radiates hope and joy throughout that process."
Puzzle,Kelly McDonald is exquisite as Agnes.
Puzzle,"Macdonald... refuses to let Agnes be an easy avatar for midlife longing and suburban discontent. With her fierce, strange energy at the center, the film builds quietly toward its own small revelations, piece by piece."
Puzzle,"To say that it's MacDonald's best performance would do the rest of her exceptional career a disservice, but she brings the richness and grace of her finest work to Agnes, and she's instrumental to the film's understated success."
Puzzle,"Macdonald has never starred in a film until ""Puzzle,"" and her delicate but deeply felt performance, along with the work of... Irrfan Khan and the rest of the cast, make this gentle, thoughtful yet pointed film the undeniable success it is."
Puzzle,"Like its protagonist, Puzzle finds itself as it goes along, and Agnes becomes a truly interesting person to root for."
Puzzle,"'Puzzle"" is less puzzling than exasperating."
Puzzle,"Like a bedtime cup of cocoa, Marc Turtletaub's ""Puzzle"" has a soothing familiarity that quiets the mind and settles the spirit."
Puzzle,Marc Turtletaub's soulful charmer honors the liberating power of life's solitary pleasures.
Puzzle,Likely to charm and move audiences even as its particulars often fail to suggest the real world.
Puzzle,Turtletaub and his screenwriters lay the borderline-anachronistic details of their heroine's oppressive life on so thick that the movie starts to sag.
Puzzle,"The film buoyed by Kelly Macdonald, who's a master of understated vulnerability, but she can't steer it out of the doldrums."
Puzzle,"It's fair to say that solving jigsaws is not a hobby which lends itself to thrilling cinema. But, accompanied by a pleasant rippling score from Dustin O'Halloran, Agnes begins to bloom."
Puzzle,This is a slow burning film but Macdonald's performance galvanises it.
Puzzle,"Kelly Macdonald shines in this rare leading role, Puzzle is a charming tale of romance and finding your place in the world."
Puzzle,"here is modest craft and genuine heart here, not to mention an eye-catching centrepiece: an actor growing more certain of herself, and more capable than ever of holding an entire picture together ..."
Puzzle,"A slow, respectably compelling start that recalls David Fincher's The Game (narratively, if not tonally) eventually gives way to a more rote thriller with a less than satisfying conclusion that's sure to infuriate many, many viewers."
Puzzle,Fits together nicely.
Puzzle,"The performances transcend the film's tropes, grounding it in characters that feel more complete than this subgenre often produces."
Puzzle,"We should be grateful that it exists, if only because it affords a long-overdue leading role to Kelly Macdonald ..."
Puzzle,"Moverman's script, based on the Argentinian film Rompecabezas by Natalia Smirnoff, is graceful with the details and its characters."
Murder on the Orient Express,ERROR
Papillon,"Papi's protracted, chaotically paced setbacks begin to feel less like a test of his resilience than the viewer's."
Papillon,"But whether taken as a study in human resilience, as an oblique love story, or as an indictment of the French penal system, this drama is claustrophobic and oppressive."
Papillon,"The deadening narrative structure (escape, capture, escape, capture etc) eventually overwhelms everything else on screen."
Papillon,Both actors rise intelligently to the occasion.
Papillon,Fails to do anything the original version didn't.
Papillon,There is no discernible benefit or loss at the end of this long drama.
Papillon,Both men put in good work but their bromance never convincingly ignites in this solid but anonymous effort by Danish director Michael Noer.
Papillon,"This adaptation of Papillon is fine. The performances are fine, the direction is fine. But was a remake really necessary if there isn't anything spectacular about it?"
Papillon,"I could never quite figure out why this story was being told again, and I drifted away from its action way too often."
Papillon,"As director Michael Noer struggles to tease a theme out of a string of exploits, Papillon remains as entertaining as ever."
Papillon,"Papillon isn't a particularly original film, but it far from a prison sentence."
Papillon,The end result feels routinely anonymous.
Papillon,"It is an impressively staged and appropriately rain-soaked, mud-splattered, bone-crunching tale, more violent and filled with rougher language than its predecessor, if not quite as powerful or moving."
Papillon,"Director Michael Noer falls short in a number of ways, leaving a sense of missed opportunity."
Papillon,"Mr. Hunnam plays Papillon with a certain fierceness and swagger, but his psyche is largely impenetrable."
Papillon,"What Charriere endured, and finally left behind, has already proven irresistible to a global audience. This retelling - prettily assembled, a little dull - gives that audience little that's truly new."
Papillon,"Though Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek give everything they've got to this true-life prison escape, they're denied the chance to make their characters as indelible as Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman did in the 1973 original."
Papillon,"If you're a fan of the two leads, it is worth your time, but if you're a fan of the original film, it becomes more of a curio, an interesting comparison of filmmaking in the Seventies to what contemporary cinema gives us today."
Papillon,"The film is mostly sedate, without tension and with too much smolder."
Papillon,"Working from a script by Aaron Guzikowski, the director Michael Noer generally puts the camera where it should go and adds a sterile Parisian interlude but nothing much else of note."
Papillon,"Charrière's 1969 book became a popular, controversial memoir in France. So why has it inspired not just one but two so-so prison escape films?"
Papillon,"Amazingly, the remake -- by Danish director Michael Noer -- is nearly as long and equally as depressing. But he's made a slightly more exciting movie."
Papillon,[It's] a sumptuous-looking but slow-moving prison drama that at times will have you dreaming about an escape of your own.
Papillon,"The result is a film with much of the same appeal as ""The Lost City of Z."" Let's hope it doesn't have the same fate."
Papillon,"It wisely doubles down on high adventure, but it's still as lifeless as its predecessor. Just in different ways."
Papillon,"Why on earth would anyone try to improve on - let alone equal - the rousingly entertaining, if melodramatic, original?"
Papillon,"Hunnam and Malek acquit themselves finely, neither trying to imitate his predecessor."
Papillon,"This new version, directed by Danish filmmaker Michael Noer, brings to the story a refreshing intensity and sweep, and even a sense of adventure."
Papillon,To contrast Franklin J. Schaffner's 1973 Papillon with its remake is to underscore certain differences between commercial films of two distinct generations.
Papillon,"While still heavily mirroring the other film's story beats, Danish director Michael Noer establishes his own rhythm. It's one of constant action and near-cartoonish brutality."
Papillon,"Hunnam and Malek both hold up their end of the deal. Noer, for his part, meets them halfway ..."
Papillon,"... this brutal, bruising film never quite connects with its deeper themes, resulting in a story full of suffering but not enough transcendence."
Papillon,"There's no real voice in the storytelling, nothing distinctive about the imagery, if it's not a doubling up on the violence and gore, and the result doesn't remotely resonate in the same way."
Papillon,What matters most is that the principally unchanged story of survival in colonial French Guiana remains a compelling one ...
Hearts Beat Loud,Offerman holds it all together with a performance as powerful as it is quiet.
Hearts Beat Loud,"Anyone who's written a song knows how much heart is poured across the sheet; Hearts Beat Loud actualizes that ""overflowing of spontaneous emotion."""
Hearts Beat Loud,"Hearts Beat Loud is a light, enjoyable film that washes over you - though perhaps doesn't linger in the mind long after the credits roll."
Hearts Beat Loud,Offerman puts in a subtle turn beneath his humongous ageing-hipster beard and Clemons is deliciously natural as the exasperated Sam.
Hearts Beat Loud,A slice of pure cinematic joy with Offerman and Clemons on top form.
Hearts Beat Loud,It's remarkable just how grating this perkily inoffensive premise manages to be.
Hearts Beat Loud,[Offerman and Clemons] and director/co-writer Brett Haley keep the story percolating - just.
Hearts Beat Loud,Dramatic tension may be in short supply but Hearts Beat Loud makes very pleasurable viewing precisely because it is so mellow and its very genial protagonists are so self-effacing.
Hearts Beat Loud,"A keenly observed story of a Brooklyn father and daughter, charged with the kind of music as free-spirited as the duo is."
Hearts Beat Loud,Music is so central to Hearts Beat Loud that it's connected to everything...Hearts Beat Loud is anything but sad.
Hearts Beat Loud,"This is a film that oozes authenticity, making all that happens hit home in ways it never could have otherwise."
Hearts Beat Loud,"The story is barrel-proof earnest sentiment, straight no chaser. How to keep the eyes from rolling in response? Well, it helps to have Nick Offerman at the center of things."
Hearts Beat Loud,"Writer-director Brett Haley...coaxes a few weak laughs from the daddy-daughter role reversal, and stale, mushy drama from the cycling death of the girl's mother more than a decade earlier."
Hearts Beat Loud,"This is a movie you not only want to see, but also to put on the turntable."
Hearts Beat Loud,Haley engagingly traces the arc of the father-daughter relationship while deftly avoiding sentimentality. And he elicits fine performances from a splendid cast.
Hearts Beat Loud,"While there are some weak platitudes delivered via dialogue, the film takes a refreshing look at queer relationships."
Hearts Beat Loud,"A lowkey, tenderhearted film that explores a mostly functional and loving relationship between a somewhat immature dad and his somewhat too mature daughter."
Hearts Beat Loud,Haley's films are things we can reach toward-there's an intimacy and candor about them that feels welcoming.
Hearts Beat Loud,A sparkling gem with an indie-rock soul. Offerman turns in his best big-screen performance yet.
Hearts Beat Loud,"You've heard this song before and can predict all the emotional high notes before they hit, but sometimes that's all you need from a summer bop."
Hearts Beat Loud,"One of the nicest things about ""Hearts Beat Loud,"" and there are several nice things, is the way that Offerman and Clemons seem like father and daughter."
Hearts Beat Loud,"The themes here are rich, the treatment indulgent and harmless, like a pre-fab version of a John Carney movie."
Hearts Beat Loud,"But the real star of this thing is [Kiersey] Clemons, so natural and expressive, whether speaking or singing."
Hearts Beat Loud,"Its smallness is its strength - as is its silence. That's the odd and evocative resonance of ""Hearts Beat Loud."""
Hearts Beat Loud,Audiences will be enchanted by Clemons and Offerman's astounding chemistry.
Hearts Beat Loud,"It often seems as though Haley, aware of the goldmine he struck with these two, is prepared to get out of the way and let them tell the story."
Hearts Beat Loud,"If you want nice and charming, that's what this is."
Hearts Beat Loud,"As written, I didn't believe these characters. And if Nick Offerman and Kiersey Clemons and Ted Danson...cannot convince me that these are actual human beings, then no one can."
Hearts Beat Loud,"The flat intonation and lethargic matter-of-factness that made Offerman's Ron Swanson the wry backbone of ""Parks & Recreation"" feels too heavy for Frank Fisher."
Hearts Beat Loud,"It's refreshing to watch a film that doesn't feel obligated to go for the brass ring (of emotion, or social commentary, or even plot)."
Hearts Beat Loud,"Haley writes roles that great actors want to play, and he creates a space for them to do their best."
Hearts Beat Loud,"Frank and Sam make beautiful music together. No, that's not a metaphor; it's an accurate description that's central to what makes ""Hearts Beat Loud"" such an engaging endeavor."
Hearts Beat Loud,Music is the tie that binds a Brooklyn father and daughter in a film that refuses to go sappy on us thanks to the tough core of intelligence and wit that Nick Offerman brings to the party.
Hearts Beat Loud,"There's not a rough edge in sight - and, for many viewers, that will be just fine."
Hearts Beat Loud,"A merciful reprieve from the trend of films that, the few times they have lesbian protagonists at all, only serve to remind us of the hellscape that being queer in America can be."
Hearts Beat Loud,"Hearts Beat Loud is smart, sincere, expertly performed..."
Hearts Beat Loud,"I couldn't help, in spite of the sometimes very clunky script, breaking into a smile every time Sam and Rose have a scene together, even a corny bike-riding one."
Hearts Beat Loud,"The steadiness with which Haley's film progresses through its dramatic beats is rather like its familiar-sounding indie pop, moving rhythmically toward a predictable climax whose emotional intensity feels unearned."
Hearts Beat Loud,"Both actors are capable of projecting nuclear levels of charisma, so it's fun just to watch them share the screen."
Hearts Beat Loud,"The messiness of the script or the lack of an aesthetic approach just don't seem to matter all that much. ""Hearts Beats Loud"" knows exactly what it is."
Hearts Beat Loud,"A truly sweet, funny, and downright likable comedy."
Hearts Beat Loud,"Kiersey Clemons proves she's the real deal. As for the film around her, Haley's 21-drum solo salute to the passage of time is, like Frank, merely fine."
Hearts Beat Loud,"A sincere, occasionally touching family dramedy with a music backdrop."
White Boy Rick,"Director Yann Demange ('71) seems uncertain whether to play the material as searing drama or black comedy, and so he gives up on establishing a recognizable tone altogether."
White Boy Rick,"When you ask yourself: ""What's so special about Rick?"" The answer is: not much."
White Boy Rick,"The music choices inject energy, but it's difficult to care about a character who is too dumb to care about himself."
White Boy Rick,I could feel the grit under its fingernails... I quite liked it.
White Boy Rick,There's an honesty to the hardscrabble family portrait that makes it worthwhile.
White Boy Rick,"The issue is not that the film focuses on a white kid, but that it doesn't seem much interested in the black lives hit disproportionately hard by the war on drugs."
White Boy Rick,Mostly good fun with some bold performances.
White Boy Rick,Yet roughing up his pretty-boy looks and playing people destined for defeat rather than Hollywood endings has become a cliché for McConaughey.
White Boy Rick,"Thought-provoking points about racial injustice are raised, only to be sketched over by the script. Still, where White Boy Rick hooks you in is as a family drama."
White Boy Rick,"A patchy follow-up to the searing '71 from director Yann Demange, but one which tells a compelling true story and offers a treat of a supporting turn from Matthew McConaughey."
White Boy Rick,"What at first appears to be a solid, albeit conventional, rise-then-fall story of a cocky young FBI informant soon morphs into something far more moving and thoughtful."
White Boy Rick,"I can think of no reason any bright, witty or halfway sophisticated movie lover-or otherwise normal person-would want to spend 10 minutes with any of the criminal degenerates in this worthless load of crap."
White Boy Rick,There are so many stories to tell about unfortunate people who get arrested and imprisoned for selling drugs. So why-oh-why did anyone think this real-life tale about a white 15-year-old drug dealer in 1980s Detroit was the one worth revealing?
White Boy Rick,"There's something strangely uninvolving about White Boy Rick, despite all its claims to be a sensational true story."
White Boy Rick,"In trying to do too much, White Boy Rick accomplishes too little."
White Boy Rick,"A lot of deals go down, and go bad, in White Boy Rick, but the one that really goes awry is the one with the audience."
White Boy Rick,"It gives the audience a seriocomic rush. The filmmakers never figure out a full and satisfying ending for a real-life story that culminates in a paralyzing injustice. But if the climactic shocks are just sketched in, the others are vivid and alive."
White Boy Rick,"It's a tale of right and wrong, greed, power and corruption. This telling gets a lot of the details right, but pulling away, the bigger picture is left rather blurred."
White Boy Rick,"McConaughey is so good and emotionally affecting as Richard Sr., in both vulnerable and tough moments, that it might even catch you off guard."
White Boy Rick,"Vivid, punchy..."
White Boy Rick,Watching this young man's life fall apart because of his destructive community and family is harrowing.
White Boy Rick,"White Boy Rick is an intriguing story brought to life by impressive performances, particularly from McConaughey and Merritt."
White Boy Rick,"What sets it a notch or two above rote familiarity is its cast, featuring a charismatic, white trash-with-a-heart-of-gold turn from a mulletted Matthew McConaughey and a naturalistically low-key performance from newcomer Richie Merritt."
White Boy Rick,Great central performances and vivid set pieces.
White Boy Rick,"Merritt is charming, authentic and incredibly watchable."
White Boy Rick,"The '80s Detroit of ""Rick"" is a wintry moral wasteland. Despair hangs heavy in the air there."
White Boy Rick,"""White Boy Rick"" works better as a working-class father/son drama than a cautionary tale about the American judicial system, though it never comes together satisfactorily as either."
White Boy Rick,"Merritt as young Rick who is a genuine revelation here, capturing the essence of his character - indolent but loyal and loving - with a performance that is subtle, textured and wholly believable."
White Boy Rick,Demange coaxes a mostly passable performance out of Merritt - it's not bad for a debut - and a quietly nuanced one from McConaughey.
White Boy Rick,A compelling if sometimes muddled true-life crime drama.
White Boy Rick,"Rick's whiteness, and the advantage that gives him, doesn't go unnoticed. The movie shows it without dwelling on it, leaving us to debate the politics of a wild and incriminating situation as it hustles along."
White Boy Rick,So the big surprise about White Boy Rick is how well the movie works. It's one thing to know a story is based on nonfiction. Being made to believe its plausibility is something else. White Boy Rick you believe.
White Boy Rick,"It doesn't turn into another Goodfellas story of crime and irony, [but] isn't saying much about the Reagan-era War on Drugs that you haven't heard before."
White Boy Rick,"While there are entertaining segments, and even a couple of comedic touches, in the end the film isn't convincing, and parts have a paint-by-the-numbers feeling."
White Boy Rick,"""White Boy Rick"" is an engrossing-enough cautionary tale, if that's what it is. It's even an entertaining one, in an unsavory kind of way."
White Boy Rick,"Purely from a standpoint of craft and storytelling, it's a good flick, although maybe not well attuned to the bombastic times."
White Boy Rick,"White Boy Rick treats its subject as a singular case, when the error of judgment that's truly kept him locked up is utterly commonplace, affecting thousands of prisoners whose stories aren't as superficially sensational."
White Boy Rick,"Mr. Demange can convey mood and feeling with his filmmaking, but he can't turn Rick Jr. into a viable character and neither can the inexpert Mr. Merritt."
White Boy Rick,The only crime that interested me in White Boy Rick was McConaughey stealing this movie. And the filmmakers know it.
White Boy Rick,"A frequently indelible cinematic experience, charged with unique energy and impact even when its premise is overly familiar."
White Boy Rick,"By treating its main character as exceptional, Yann Demange's film validates the punitive system it seeks to criticize."
White Boy Rick,"Though it's a well-done family drama, White Boy Rick is a half-told story that only lightly incorporates the deeper issues of systemic injustice."
White Boy Rick,"Despite certain structural gaffes, White Boy Rick observantly portrays a family stuck in a cycle of despair."
White Boy Rick,"Despite impressive performances by Matthew McConaughey and newcomer Richie Merritt, the film fails to engage or enlighten."
White Boy Rick,"""White Boy Rick"" attempts to mine drama from circumstances without succeeding at making any of its characters all that sympathetic."
White Boy Rick,"What ultimately happened to Wershe was a scandal, though it's hard to get too worked up when the movie itself is such a jumble."
You Were Never Really Here,"[T]his intoxicatingly stylish work is all over the place, a hot mess at times so ravishing it sends shivers down to the toes. Unfortunately, it's also at times just plain crass and silly."
You Were Never Really Here,"In the end, there's no question that what you're watching is a masterfully-made movie, albeit one that's easier to admire from afar than up close."
You Were Never Really Here,"It's the kind of movie I'm glad [Ramsay] made because her interrogation of Joe's masculinity is the sort of thing endemic to the material that many male directors might have missed in an attempt to make the movie more ""exciting."""
You Were Never Really Here,"The film is technically impressive in every respect with fine, fluid camerawork by Thomas Townend and an impressive electronic music score by Jonny Greenwood."
You Were Never Really Here,"Enough information is provided to let us discern the rudiments of a conventional plot - but our understanding of this remains tentative, hypothetical, shadowed by the possibility that all is not as it seems."
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here isn't just about the rescue of a State Senator's daughter. Rather an expression of a single man's existence, ghostly by all extents."
You Were Never Really Here,"Phoenix gives an astounding performance, bolstered by an unpredictable script and soundtrack."
You Were Never Really Here,"Extraordinarily, Ramsay's film is not about people; instead it uses them and their bodies to explore American systems of power, and the abuse that develops within."
You Were Never Really Here,"What it lacks in straightforward narrative structure, it makes up for in chest-level punch, and ""You Were Never Really Here"" lands like a blow to the sternum."
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here is not a film that particularly wants you to ""like"" it. But with its highbrow talent and arty flourishes, it all but dares you to admit that you disliked it. Challenge accepted."
You Were Never Really Here,"[Phoenix], the mumbling master of smug self-indulgence, dons another layer of Emperor's new duds to favor us with a performance as subtle as a fart in a sardined elevator and twice as odiferous."
You Were Never Really Here,We do not deserve Lynne Ramsay.
You Were Never Really Here,"In a case of trying to run before knowing how to walk, Ramsay tries to make a different kind of action movie without bothering to master the rudiments of the form."
You Were Never Really Here,Joaquin Phoenix has never been shy about going big if the role called for it -- and maybe even if the role didn't necessarily call for it -- but his performance here ranks as one of his best because of what happens between the outbursts.
You Were Never Really Here,"Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry."
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style."
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work."
You Were Never Really Here,"""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero."
You Were Never Really Here,"[Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing."
You Were Never Really Here,"Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball."
You Were Never Really Here,"You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time."
You Were Never Really Here,"Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost."
You Were Never Really Here,"""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it."
You Were Never Really Here,"If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images."
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in."
You Were Never Really Here,"A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe."
You Were Never Really Here,"With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds."
You Were Never Really Here,Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.
You Were Never Really Here,Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you.
You Were Never Really Here,You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.
You Were Never Really Here,"The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye."
You Were Never Really Here,"Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre."
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave."
You Were Never Really Here,"The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock."
You Were Never Really Here,I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.
You Were Never Really Here,"From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame."
You Were Never Really Here,"A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence."
You Were Never Really Here,If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers).
You Were Never Really Here,"Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity."
You Were Never Really Here,[director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.
You Were Never Really Here,The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.
You Were Never Really Here,"An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver"
You Were Never Really Here,"Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us."
You Were Never Really Here,You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.
You Were Never Really Here,A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.
You Were Never Really Here,"This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art."
You Were Never Really Here,"[Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be."
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly."
You Were Never Really Here,"A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film."
You Were Never Really Here,"In these staggeringly taut 85 minutes, Ramsay sees a hopeless universe in a jelly bean."
You Were Never Really Here,"Ramsay has made a terrific short story, economical as hell but also so moment-for-moment gripping that you want to pore over its every shot, its every dark cranny."
You Were Never Really Here,"Lynne Ramsay has made a film that burns so much brighter and cuts so much deeper than any such story has a right to. Do you remember the first time you saw ""Taxi Driver""?"
You Were Never Really Here,"There are multitudes in here, but not a second is wasted. It is a brash, noisy, violent picture, but it is also a subtle, intricate, thoughtful one."
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here is a powerful assault of a film, but it's missing its director's inimitable poetry."
You Were Never Really Here,"For all of its meticulous construction and often masterful craft, the film remains something to coldly admire rather than easily embrace, often playing more as a collection of accomplished filmmaking moments than as a fully enthralling whole."
You Were Never Really Here,"Ramsay has made more sensually rapturous films, but this may be her most formally exacting: No shot or cut here is idle or extraneous."
You Were Never Really Here,It's a mesmerizing illustration of [Ramsay's] ability to treasure small gestures and whispered exchanges over exposition to construct a tapestry of alternately gripping and melancholic emotions.
You Were Never Really Here,The ghost of Travis Bickle haunts this nightmarish and humidly absorbing psychological drama from Lynne Ramsay.
You Were Never Really Here,"You Were Never Really Here presents as Ramsay's first genre offering, ramping up the body count and bloodshed, while maintaining her usual focus on unusual characters."
Phantom Thread,ERROR
12 Strong,"Unfortunately the movie's central philosophical conflict, between the captain and an Afghan warlord, features dialogue like ""Your mission will fail because you fear death."""
12 Strong,"This is an intense, serious war film."
12 Strong,"The action is frequent and gripping, the heroism present but understated, and the sense of tactical complexity has survived the script-writing process, so there is more geo-political subtlety than one expects from a post-9/11 American war movie."
12 Strong,As pointless and as unnecessarily long as the conflict that inspired it.
12 Strong,"Like so many muscles in Hollywood, it all feels rather fake: steroidal and pumped up rather than legitimately hard-won."
12 Strong,"Yes, it's intense jingoistic nonsense and full of hilarious caricatures - watch out for US enemy No 1, the evil Arab Mullah Razzan, played by Numan Acar in deadpan homage to Aladdin's cartoon nemesis Jafar."
12 Strong,The true story is served well enough -- to the point where you have a huge amount of respect for these men when you leave the theater.
12 Strong,12 Strong combines formidable technique with a very simple-minded and jingoistic perspective on the American war on terror.
12 Strong,It's all very easy: a feelgood war tale from what feels like a distant age.
12 Strong,An effective - if overly simplistic - neo-Western that's eventually carried over the line by a sparky ensemble cast.
12 Strong,"12 Strong passes by doggedly and in a haze, a theatre of war which gives us back row seats rather than throwing us properly into the thick of things."
12 Strong,A predictable telling of an extraordinary tale. The action sequences and the performances elevate it though.
12 Strong,"The Horse Soldiers' story is unconventional, and the film-produced by uber-slickster Jerry Bruckheimer-has been shaped along conventional war-movie lines."
12 Strong,"Although the characters are all types, the performances are strong enough that we identify with them despite their lack of depth."
12 Strong,It's all solid from a technical perspective. Where the film could have used more power is in its narrative momentum.
12 Strong,"There's just as much to like here as there is to be frustrated with, the final product a mixed bag of good intentions, decent ideas and missed opportunities."
12 Strong,"Never delves deep enough to examine the larger involvement of the U.S. and those ramifications, but ""12 Strong"" manages to infuse heart and character into this adrenaline-fueled war film"
12 Strong,"Fuglsig's feature debut is ultimately less an action movie and more a procedural, one in which incremental gains and minimal casualties are as much as can be hoped for."
12 Strong,Put aside your hindsight and at least you'll be rewarded with some invigorating action.
12 Strong,"""12 Strong"" does its best to tell a story of heroism from a dark chapter in our history, but its reality is much more complicated."
12 Strong,"Hemsworth, Shannon, and Pena create real, relatable and yet heroic characters, and seeing them ride into battle on horseback is genuinely moving and inspiring."
12 Strong,"It's occasionally good, but for the most part, 12 Strong simply does its job."
12 Strong,"Combat scenes seem more interested in the faces than the fracas, missions are undertaken with no apparent outcome, and great difficulties loom and then dissolve like mist."
12 Strong,"What makes ""12 Strong"" objectionable - and what will also make it appealing to some - is its attempt to induce a kind of amnesia in the audience ..."
12 Strong,"If you want to feel good about a war with no end, this one's for you."
12 Strong,"""12 Strong"" lacks depth but fulfills its mission to entertain."
12 Strong,... the numbers don't add up; the movie lacks a discernible attitude toward those desperate days in America's history.
12 Strong,This is not a movie with time on its hands for character development or scrappy political discussions. What 12 Strong does deliver is a rousing tribute to soldiers whose contributions went unheralded for years.
12 Strong,"It tells its story, about 12 American special-forces soldiers who spearhead a decisive battle in Afghanistan against the Taliban, with both laudable restraint and a healthy respect for what actually happened."
12 Strong,It's a remarkable true tale of great heroism.
12 Strong,12 Strong winds up being an almost-good film about some great American soldiers.
12 Strong,"More often than not, ""12 Strong"" feels like a sports movie, where all the stakes rest not on matters of honor and duty, but on a single field goal."
12 Strong,"A fairly straightforward and enjoyable movie about an extremely complicated and demoralizing war. Its goal is to focus on a small group of heroes, and it shows little interest in the bigger picture."
12 Strong,"As Nicolai Fuglsig doesn't allow any complicated thoughts about war, colonization, and mortality to hover around his characters, 12 Strong inevitably proceeds as a jaunty imperial adventure through the wilds of northern Afghanistan."
12 Strong,"For devotees of cinematic blowouts and dedicated students of screen masculinity (like me), ""12 Strong"" is premium, Grade A catnip."
12 Strong,"In the end, the feat these characters pull off is rousing, but 12 Strong never gathers the momentum it needs."
12 Strong,"Yet what could have been a flag-waving slog across the beautiful wilderness of Afghanistan (substituted here by New Mexico), interspersed with massive explosions, is instead surprisingly elegant for a blockbuster."
12 Strong,"It might be enough that ""12 Strong"" makes you feel good that the United States still produces guys like this. Too bad we didn't get to know about the real guys and their actual story."
12 Strong,"It's not a bad movie, as far as it goes. In terms of context, though, it goes virtually nowhere."
12 Strong,"Intriguingly, the filmmakers and their Chris Hemsworth-led ensemble are most concerned with the uneasy strategic and cross-cultural connections forged between US special forces and Afghan militia in their mutual fight against the Taliban."
12 Strong,"""12 Strong"" does a good job of telling a great story, about the first Americans to fight their way into Afghanistan after 9/11."
12 Strong,"Sans magic hammer, Chris Hemsworth's career as a leading man is spotty at best. It seems he just needed horse co-stars."
12 Strong,Contents itself with peddling the same crap about pure valor and warrior ethos that's been around since wars were actually fought on horseback-and it doesn't even have the decency to reward viewers a rousing cavalry charge.
12 Strong,"It's a rousing movie, but not what you'd call a very introspective one."
12 Strong,"... stirring and solid, ""12 Strong"" is the kind of film that might make you think twice about January releases, and spotlights a riveting story in our recent history that many Americans might not know."
12 Strong,"This Chris Hemsworth vehicle is is often hammy, but also wryly funny, breath-stoppingly tense, and uncommonly intelligent. Its January dump is a disservice to a promising debut feature."
12 Strong,"On its own terms, the film is watchable enough, but it's blunt and stolid and under-characterized, and at 130 minutes it plods."
12 Strong,Thor has been promoted to Captain America.
12 Strong,"It's virtually all Hemsworth's show and he's entirely up to the task of carrying the film on his broad shoulders: He's charismatic, fearless, confident, jokey and a good old Kentucky boy who just wants to get the job done ..."
12 Strong,"A solid cast and some striking visuals aren't enough to fortify this run-of-the-mill war movie, which touts themes of valor and brotherhood in only the most familiar of ways."
Chappaquiddick,The movie offers a convincing demonstration of how political mechanisms conspire to protect the powerful from their own mistakes.
Chappaquiddick,"Some interesting moments here, but the film is one long pulled punch."
Chappaquiddick,"A deftly executed examination of the man at the centre of the scandal and the psychological scars that come from being a Kennedy scion. In this, Clarke does a wonderful job at conveying the conflict brewing inside Ted."
Chappaquiddick,The film seems to me a fair-minded stab at the truth and an irresistible look at the exercise of dynastic influence.
Chappaquiddick,Chappaquiddick is the best film to date directed by John Curran.
Chappaquiddick,In the end Chappaquiddick will have to pass the same test as Kennedy's original version of the story-whether or not anyone will buy it.
Chappaquiddick,"Clarke makes us feel plenty of things we'd rather not. His eyes are shadowed with profound decency one minute, and hollowed out in desperate calculation the next."
Chappaquiddick,"The filmmakers seem to be concerned about preserving her innocence, just as the real-life Kennedy was. It may be a bit idealistic, but it's not a disservice."
Chappaquiddick,"If you're looking for something to make you feel good about chubby, cherubic Ted, the venerable lion of the Senate, this is not your movie."
Chappaquiddick,"A film of integrity and disclosure, a controversial chapter in American history that substitutes clinical accuracy for Hollywood embellishment, with an impressive attention to detail and an admirable respect for suspenseful narrative."
Chappaquiddick,"Director John Curran's Chappaquiddick is a decent Cliff's Notes version of events, though it's hard not see sanitization masquerading as ambiguity."
Chappaquiddick,The sketches of Kennedy-family tensions and loyalties are thin and simplistic; the action rushes by with little insight or context.
Chappaquiddick,"Chappaquiddick is heavy-handed history, a film that at times seems to owe as much to The X-Files as the many cinematic dives into the target-rich territory that is the Kennedy clan."
Chappaquiddick,"Jason Clarke, the Australian actor (Mudbound, Zero Dark Thirty) is a fleshy, entitled and very convincing Teddy..."
Chappaquiddick,"For those who are drawn to re-creations of historical controversies that pack more gravitas and outright tragedy, Chappaquiddick could prove satisfying enough, especially with the in-vogue-again Kennedy clan at the center."
Chappaquiddick,"A lucid, nuanced and compelling telling of the accident and its turbulent aftermath."
Chappaquiddick,This is yet another first-rate film from John Curran that should capture the attention of anyone who remembers the Ted Kennedy incident (as I do) as well as young people who want a credible slice of recent American history.
Chappaquiddick,"Chappaquiddick isn't a harangue against Kennedy, but it does take a hard look at a man who was a revered stalwart of the Democratic party. The film works best as a character study, a profile of moral crisis, rather than any sort of true-crime expos."
Chappaquiddick,"Chappaquiddick reminds us that without the Kennedy name and influence, the man who drove a car off a bridge, swam to shore and left a young woman to die, and then went into hiding and defense mode, should have gone to jail for a long time."
Chappaquiddick,"Devoid of revelations, the film instead focuses on the creation and delivery of the narrative that Kennedy used to survive this calamity...It allows Chappaquiddick to become an example of the very thing it portrays."

Chappaquiddick,"Camelot, it's not. And, as this terrific movie suggests, the American people fall for their polished BS every time."
Chappaquiddick,"In the final analysis ""Chappaquiddick"" is the story of a weak man. Maybe someone who had deep-seated reasons for that weakness, but still a not particularly appealing individual whose actions frustrate rather than draw us in."
Chappaquiddick,"But small lapses, together with the confusions and glib evasions of a production that is neither fact nor fiction, raise the larger question of what the film is, and ultimately becomes."
Chappaquiddick,"Serves as a timely reminder that voters on either side of the aisle are susceptible to influence, especially when it's wrapped up in male entitlement and oligarchical polish."
Chappaquiddick,"The workmanlike script by Andrew Logan and Taylor Allen sticks to mostly verifiable facts, although it is damning in what it shows without comment."
Chappaquiddick,"It's a film looking to challenge America's gauzy perception of the country's most famous political family, loaded with all the bleakness that task requires."
Chappaquiddick,"A political biopic's most difficult target lies in the elusive circle above character assassination and below hagiography. ""Chappaquiddick"" misses that target."
Chappaquiddick,"Clarke's terrific performance...embodies several aspects of the character, sometimes all at once."
Chappaquiddick,"Did Sen. Ted Kennedy (an electrifying Jason Clarke) leave a female passenger to drown when his car plunged off a bridge in 1969? Instead of scandal, this questing film examines the broken moral compass of a driven politician."
Chappaquiddick,"Whether or not events actually unfolded this way, the story the film tells is an interesting and complicated character study, with something to say about the corrosive effects of power and privilege on both the innocent and the guilty."
Chappaquiddick,"Rather than simply point out that the famous man did a bad thing, Clarke's Kennedy is something more elemental, a snapshot of a failure of all the things masculinity was and to some degree is still billed as."
Chappaquiddick,John Curran creates room for his characters to think and feel and an environment that encourages us to do the same.
Chappaquiddick,"Plays out simultaneously like a political thriller, a tale of injustice, and a rewriting of a beloved public figure - and had me immediately searching Wikipedia to devour more details."
Chappaquiddick,John Curran's gripping story about a 50-year-old scandal has plenty to say about modern politics.
Chappaquiddick,"An entertainingly brutal portrait of feckless privilege and buried tragedy, hewing reasonably close to those points we know to be true and juicily provocative about what happened in rooms you and I weren't privy to."
Chappaquiddick,"We've been so awash in hackneyed Kennedy brogues and caricatured portrayals that Clarke's performance -- stout, nuanced, understated almost to a fault -- is an unexpected relief."
Chappaquiddick,"Curran's film, often enthralling and upsetting, represents a welcome break in the hagiographic treatment the longtime Lion of the Senate enjoyed in the years leading up to his 2009 death."
Chappaquiddick,"Led by Jason Clarke's expertly shallow performance, this stodgy but effective character study is powered by its dispirited mood and dryly critical tone."
Chappaquiddick,"Here is a family that entrenched itself in the American imagination by campaigning on symbolism, and Chappaquiddick hits its better strides when it turns the camera on the relationship between its stars and script doctors."
Chappaquiddick,"First-time screenwriters Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan's tight script sticks mostly to the well-documented facts and aftermath, and Clarke lets his Teddy live in the tricky place between sympathy and straight villain-hood."
Chappaquiddick,"A challenging character study, punctuated by moments of uneasy suspense and dark humor."
Chappaquiddick,The drama between Teddy and his daddy is so rich and thick it's like watching a Greek Tragedy.
Chappaquiddick,The push and pull of this movie is really between the lead character and the audience. One moment we feel compassionate: he wants to do the right thing. The next moment he's gone down the cover-up rabbit hole and is an irredeemable swine.
Chappaquiddick,"[jason] Clarke does wonders with the material, adding new dimensions and layers between what hit the screen and what lingered just out of frame."
Chappaquiddick,"Everything is methodical, it covers most of the bases, but passion and vitality are crucially missing from director John Curran's treatment."
Chappaquiddick,"""Chappaquiddick"" is exactly what you want it to be: a tense, scrupulous, absorbingly precise and authentic piece of history - a tabloid scandal attached to a smoke-filled-room travesty."
Fifty Shades Freed,"The dialog is very terrible. And the problem, therefore, is that the actors have to wrestle with very terrible dialog."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Its makers have somehow convinced themselves that there's not only a story we care about, but an arc to be followed."
Fifty Shades Freed,"This repetitive, glassy-eyed finale feels more like a weak victory lap, offering little pleasure but plenty of lifestyle porn (not to mention product placement) by way of luxury cars, a decadent Paris honeymoon and an enviable alpine view bubble bath."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Even the likable stars, Jamie Sidegroin and Dakota Frontboob, can do nothing with material that has grown more tedious with each installment."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Freed appeals to women's biological urges-to secure a protective mate, to nest, to procreate-and depends on them leaving their brains at the theater door."
Fifty Shades Freed,"The Fifty Shades trilogy is an incredibly inept addition to the genre, with padded scenes, no narrative spark whatsoever, and silly coincidences about Christian's troubled past that stand in for revelations that may lead to mending."
Fifty Shades Freed,Fifty Shades Freed is a totally selfish lover who will never give you what you want.
Fifty Shades Freed,"What a sorry state of affairs for moviegoers: all we want is a little coitus, but all we get is interruptus."
Fifty Shades Freed,This finale is the weakest of the three. The two stars look like they are going through the motions a bit. The script is trite.
Fifty Shades Freed,An end to a damp squib of a trilogy which sees Johnson as the only one to emerge unscathed.
Fifty Shades Freed,"It limps to a finish and when it's over, I imagine that no one is happier to see the end than its two stars."
Fifty Shades Freed,This lumbering trilogy of trash based on the books by E. L. James has so run out of blood and oxygen that it has varicose veins.
Fifty Shades Freed,"With little else to keep me interested as the story stumbled along, I did enjoy keeping track of all the trendy names of various minor supporting characters."
Fifty Shades Freed,Fifty Shades Freed is so unarousing that it could be used as therapy in a sex addiction clinic. The complete lack of intelligence and fun has got to be a factor.
Fifty Shades Freed,"The film isn't even sexy. The sex scenes are just strange and awkward; and the relationship, like I said, is so toxic that you can't really get any enjoyment out of those scenes either. It's just a giant disappointing mess."
Fifty Shades Freed,"These movies are derivative, often ridiculous, and, in the case of Fifty Shades Freed, unquestionably hilarious, but they're also the overheated comfort food I crave."
Fifty Shades Freed,"The impersonally crafted, emptily realized, expensively produced movie gets its modicum of humanity from Dakota Johnson, who has the gift of simply seeming alive and present when she's on camera."
Fifty Shades Freed,"A sequel so awful it needs to be described in detail to be believed. Therefore, a spoilereview."
Fifty Shades Freed,Director James Foley has made some decent thrillers in his time but simply can't find a way to whip up any dramatic interest here whatsoever.
Fifty Shades Freed,"Fifty Shades is a veritable orgy of ineptitude and unprofessionalism - which might not be a problem, except that the film also insists on showing everyone at work all the time."
Fifty Shades Freed,The Greys become the old married couple who are so boring that even their sex doesn't look particularly new anymore.
Fifty Shades Freed,"More sex means less chatter. That's a good thing, because Dornan is much more eloquent when wrapping his tongue around nipples and ice cream than the hot garbage in the script."
Fifty Shades Freed,"But seriously, for a movie that's supposed to be the final stroke in some kind of galactic-level movie orgasm, they sure picked the people least likely to make that happen."
Fifty Shades Freed,"They're actually ... a boring couple, truth be told."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Did someone say ""freed"" already? Yes, please. Red. Red. Red."
Fifty Shades Freed,"There are unintentional laughs in the plodding, clunky story, but the biggest laugh is the one this series has had on the audience for three movies."
Fifty Shades Freed,"The sex scenes are strangely mechanical and devoid of passion. It's probably a mixture of three things: directorial decisions, a lack of chemistry between the leads, and viewer apathy."
Fifty Shades Freed,Actually really mostly pretty good.
Fifty Shades Freed,"Might as well be called ""So I Married a Sociopath."""
Fifty Shades Freed,... it's easy to get the feeling the two actors would rather be anywhere else than standing there trying to look romantic while ensnarled in another's arms.
Fifty Shades Freed,The most liberating thing about James Foley's Fifty Shades Freed is that it doesn't even try to make sense of Christian Grey.
Fifty Shades Freed,two hours of cruel and unusual punishment . The zero-star rating may be too kind
Fifty Shades Freed,"The sex scenes are, save the occasional bit of exposed flesh or brandished toy, fairly mild -- Freed is probably the least provocative film of the trilogy."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Johnson and Dornan's performances are wooden and their chemistry nonexistent (particularly in the movie's more-of-the-same sex scenes), but think of it all as ultra-deadpan entertainment and it kind of works."
Fifty Shades Freed,"If liberation is the endgame of ""Fifty Shades Freed,"" most of the time we feel trapped right alongside the characters, immobilized by the pointless, suffocating beauty and the stultifying dramatic inertia of the world James has created for them."
Fifty Shades Freed,Why is there an umbrella stand in the Red Room?
Fifty Shades Freed,"There's plenty of artfully-lit airbrushed sex -- and unintended guffaws -- for those with a taste for midnight-movie-style chewy badness. Otherwise, the safe word should be ""avoid."""
Fifty Shades Freed,"More of an endless perfume commercial than a story, with beautiful people smooching (and more) in a series of increasingly luxurious settings and modes of transportation."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Though it's difficult to discern the flavour of ice cream used in one so-called erotic encounter, it's probably vanilla."
Fifty Shades Freed,I like these people. I'm rather sorry to see this series end.
Fifty Shades Freed,"Johnson has a sense of Anastasia not just as part of a pristinely arranged tableau but also as a sensualist, with all the attendant nerve endings and complex emotions that that implies."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Ana can now stand up to Christian's emotionally manipulative, controlling tendencies (remember, kink ain't the same as abuse, kids). She even shows agency once or twice. But what replaces it is just as risible."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Finally, we are freed of this franchise."
Fifty Shades Freed,"To her credit, Johnson actually turns in her best Shades stuff here ... Too bad it's not enough to save everything else about this whole silly affair's fumbling climax."
Fifty Shades Freed,"If I can persuade just one of you to bypass its milquetoast masochism and watch the stratospherically superior ""9 1/2 Weeks"" instead, then I will have done my job."
Fifty Shades Freed,Just turn off your brain and submit.
Fifty Shades Freed,Is there room for both responsibility and butt-plugs in this crazy world?
Fifty Shades Freed,"If you go to see this movie because you want to watch people have sex, I have this thing I want to tell you about called 'internet pornography.'"
Fifty Shades Freed,"As the trilogy goes out, more desperate than ever to convince us it was in on the joke all along, it's hard to say exactly what the joke was."
Fifty Shades Freed,It seems embarrassed to embrace its own pervy nature. It's kitsch that looks in the mirror and deludes itself into thinking it sees art staring back.
Fifty Shades Freed,"A hungry audience does get a sex scene where a pint of Ben & Jerry's Vanilla reappears in a nod to ""Fifty Shades Darker,"" but like most of the movie, it's less sexy than it is silly."
Fifty Shades Freed,As usual it's left entirely up to the beleaguered Johnson to make any of it even remotely watchable.
Fifty Shades Freed,This is a film in which one of the more emotionally detailed performances is given by a product-placement Audi.
Fifty Shades Freed,"""Fifty Shades Freed"" suffers from a lack of rhythm, moving from plot point to plot point with as much spontaneity as meal-planning for one's luxury penthouse household with one's housekeeper."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Finally, the ""Fifty Shades"" phenomenon has yielded a disarming comedy that makes this ridiculous material fun to watch."
Fifty Shades Freed,"A sex-free, PG-13 version of ""Freed"" could be cut without shedding a second of narrative coherence, such as it is; one could ask what the point of that would be, though similar queries might be leveled at the film as it stands."
Fifty Shades Freed,"Seriously, is this the best we can offer adults who don't want to watch Marvel movies?"
The Shape of Water,ERROR
Call Me by Your Name,"A modern-day Visconti, Italian director Luca Guadagnino (I Am Love) grants us entry into a world not only of wealth but of culture, which can be just as liberating."
Call Me by Your Name,"Call Me By Your Name survives because of poignant screenwriting, keen directing, and tender acting."
Call Me by Your Name,The characters' beauty and intellectual perfection is so consummate that I couldn't entirely believe that these people actually had genitals-that they could ever sweat or incur sunburn.
Call Me by Your Name,"This is a beautiful film -- one that is startlingly real. It feels so blisteringly sensual and in the moment, that it's almost impossible to ignore."
Call Me by Your Name,"""Call Me By Your Name"" can be considered an idealistic film, but that's only natural for something about young people experiencing something wonderful for the first time."
Call Me by Your Name,"This coming-of-age love story is all texture, tone and nuance...Luca Guadagnino has made a lovely cinematic feather. And it floats down beautifully, riding a soft breeze of melancholy and grace."
Call Me by Your Name,Hammer is exceptionally fine in the film... while Chalamet is perfect as the indecisive youth who is drawn to this exotic stranger in ways he himself can't fully comprehend.
Call Me by Your Name,"It's a story less about the characters involved than it is about the dynamics between them, a late addition to the Symposium's accounts of the great god Love."
Call Me by Your Name,"""Call Me By Your Name"" is a visually stunning coming-of-age story that boasts a star-making performance by Chalamet."
Call Me by Your Name,"A love affair is inevitable, but Guadagnino doesn't skim over Elio's prolonged longing, which is what makes Call Me by Your Name most potent as a coming-of-age picture, not a mere romance."
Call Me by Your Name,"Despite all its pain, love is always worth it, the film argues-and makes you believe."
Call Me by Your Name,The film is beautifully shot and the performances are outstanding.
Call Me by Your Name,You may not realize how strong the acting is until you replay the movie in your head later.
Call Me by Your Name,Chalamet is a revelation.
Call Me by Your Name,"It's a piercing glimpse of a young man's bright, confounding first love, the kind of love that brings disorientation and rhapsody."
Call Me by Your Name,"Slowly, as if in a delicate tango, the two move toward each other, and ""Call Me By Your Name"" becomes the story of a connection, both sexual and emotional."
Call Me by Your Name,Few films handle coming of age with as much grace and humanity as Call Me By Your Name and the audience is as transformed by the experience as the characters.
Call Me by Your Name,"Call Me by Your Name is a perfect, lazy, worry-free day, practically devoid of any real-world concerns and absolutely dripping with intellectual and artistic stimulation, and all manner of sexual enticement."
Call Me by Your Name,"A complicated movie, erotic yet never graphic, heartfelt yet highly stylized. Chalamet delivers one of the year's best performances."
Call Me by Your Name,"One of the year's most romantic movies, and also one of the best."
Call Me by Your Name,"A spellbinding, almost ecstatically beautiful movie that gains even more heft and meaning in its final transcendent moments."
Call Me by Your Name,"""Call Me by Your Name"" is enough to make you move to the town of Crema, even if your rational self realizes the director Luca Guadagnino trades in a heightened, miragelike state of mythic yearning."
Call Me by Your Name,"""Call Me By Your Name"" is transcendent in its first hour, communicating much through the camera's evocation of nature and the screenplay's clear yet subtle dialogue."
Call Me by Your Name,"It's a story of first love: impossible, impermanent, and passionate."
Call Me by Your Name,Luca Guadagnino's tale of budding gay romance in 1980s Italy is one of the most mesmerizing films of the year.
Call Me by Your Name,"Luca Guadagnino's romantic drama Call Me By Your Name sneaks up on you -- by the end, it stings with the lingering ache of a late-summer sunburn."
Call Me by Your Name,"Veteran director James Ivory, the screenwriter here, has adapted Aciman's novel with delicacy and discretion. Guadagnino's visual style, on the other hand, is so swoony that one might require a fainting couch."
Call Me by Your Name,"The direction by Luca Guadagnino is reminiscent of Bertolucci's sensitivity at its best, the fabulous cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom rapturously captures the rich work of art that is Italy in summer, and the actors are to die for."
Call Me by Your Name,"It's the rare movie that dares to show us what unconditional love is, not just from romantic interests, but also from the people who love us the most and know us the best."
Call Me by Your Name,"Call Me by Your Name makes you remember how it felt to realize, as you became an adult, that your best experiences are ephemeral-that by the time you recognize an experience for what it is, it's already a memory."
Call Me by Your Name,"Although it ends on a powerful, bittersweet chord, the movie is a bit too determinedly soothing for comfort."
Call Me by Your Name,"So assailed are we by reports of harmful pleasures, and of the coercive male will being imposed through lust, that it comes as a relief to be reminded, in such style, of consensual joy."
Call Me by Your Name,"You don't just watch Luca Guadagnino's movies, you swoon into them."
Call Me by Your Name,... an aesthetic journey that pays off in a stunning third act when the endless summer quickens to light speed and is gone in a flash.
Call Me by Your Name,"Raw, and real, and profoundly, indelibly moving."
Call Me by Your Name,"First love is as much about hesitancy as it is about exuberance, and Ivory and Guadagnino perfectly capture that sweet turmoil. This isn't just an instant LGBT classic; this is one of the great movie love stories, for audiences of all stripes."
Call Me by Your Name,"... remarkable for how it turns literature into pure cinema, all emotion and image and heady sensation."
Call Me by Your Name,"Chalamet, a world away from his fine work in ""Lady Bird,"" is a young actor to watch."
Call Me by Your Name,"Call Me By Your Name is like a treasured artifact from your youth, back when withering looks from a first love felt like daggers to the heart."
Call Me by Your Name,The way it explores at length the sweet and sour aspects of first love is worth savoring.
Call Me by Your Name,"The small miracle of the movie isn't just that it tells a gay love story with such unreserved tenderness, but that it makes the fate of a romance not meant to last feel like much more than exquisitely framed filmmaking."
Call Me by Your Name,"Filmed in luminous 35mm, as attentive to the colors and sounds of nature as it is to the beauty of art, architecture, and yes, Armie Hammer, this is the kind of movie you live in as much as watch."
Call Me by Your Name,"One of the very best films of the year. Guadagnino, a master cinema sensualist, and his award-caliber actors Chalamet, Hammer and Stuhlbarg create a love story for the ages and a new film classic. Let it in."
Call Me by Your Name,"A lush and vibrant masterpiece about first love set amid the warm, sunny skies, gentle breezes and charming, tree-lined roads of northern Italy."
Call Me by Your Name,"Languor, lust; yearning, yielding: Call Me by Your Name-a sexy, melancholy summer idyll directed by the supreme cine-sybarite Luca Guadagnino-lushly shows how desire is deftly articulated, even when not explicitly labeled or spoken."
Call Me by Your Name,"It's a rare remembrance of love that knows the heartbreak after is just as tied up in the experience as the joy during. More, perhaps."
Call Me by Your Name,"Call Me by Your Name is more invitingly heartfelt and less baroque than the director's previous films, and skillfully captures ... the languor of the summer mood."
Call Me by Your Name,"Chalamet, however, is mesmerizing in the film. He carries the weight of the emotional layers so beautifully and effortlessly."
Call Me by Your Name,The achievement of the director Luca Guadagnino is to create in the absence of any obvious opposition a picture that is still taut with inner tensions.
Call Me by Your Name,"Call Me By Your Name is a very tasteful exercise. This is one of those movie environments that admits only the intelligent, the well-dressed and the culturally sophisticated."
Call Me by Your Name,"Chalamet, with his restless, impatient physicality and a face as sensual and sculpted as a fallen angel from a Caravaggio painting, is quite simply astonishing."
Call Me by Your Name,"The camera pays an almost hyperreal attention to detail, poring over certain words and touches with the obsessiveness of an infatuated teenager."
Call Me by Your Name,"What makes this film special? Aside from the fluid script, inventive camerawork and three uncanny songs by Sufjan Stevens, it's surely the acting, which seems scooped from the performers' marrow."
Call Me by Your Name,"A mediocre film would use Elio's parents as a one-note backdrop to his affair: oblivious, disbelieving, disapproving or draconian. Here they are none of those things."
Call Me by Your Name,"What makes the film so magical is the extraordinary delicacy, formal daring and insight with which Guadagnino tackles such familiar material."
Call Me by Your Name,Saturated with poetic languor and a deeply sophisticated sensuality.
Call Me by Your Name,"It's an incomparably lovely period romance, as warm and therapeutic as the sunlight that suffuses every frame."
Call Me by Your Name,"The film's genius is that it never settles into a steady track. Shots are often held too long or too short, by orthodox rules. Piano runs suddenly ambush the soundtrack."
Call Me by Your Name,"A beautiful film about love and longing, one you'll want (and need) to watch again and again and again."
Call Me by Your Name,"A film that's at once light, joyful and emotionally devastating, with deeply affecting central performances. A full-hearted romantic masterpiece."
Call Me by Your Name,"Not only offers a feast for your eyes, but also imagery so evocative it'll make your heart race and your fingers tingle with the memory of sun and touches from summers past."
Call Me by Your Name,There's something quite touching about watching Stuhlbarg in Call Me by Your Name eight years after his breakthrough in A Serious Man.
Call Me by Your Name,"Call Me by Your Name is a fairly straightforward coming-of-age story that's at its finest in moments when the relationships take on larger meanings than their literal context implies, and Luca Guadagnino finds evocative aesthetic expressions for them."
Call Me by Your Name,Italy has never looked so inviting.
Call Me by Your Name,It can try the patience.
Call Me by Your Name,"First love has rarely been depicted as beautifully or as movingly as it is in Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name, an adaptation of the André Aciman."
Call Me by Your Name,"Stripped of the baggage that so often complicates and corrupts queer romance, Call Me by Your Name is allowed to flourish as an unfiltered evocation of the agony and ecstasy of first love."
Call Me by Your Name,Luca Guadagnino's film proves affecting as a chronicle of a young man learning to embrace his more emotional side.
Call Me by Your Name,"In attaching sinuous style and casual sexiness to a universal ache, [Luca] Guadagnino has come away with real wisdom. Sweet and salty, his movie burns like a suntan."
Call Me by Your Name,It's hard to think of many movies that have so successfully appealed to both the intellectual and the erotic since the heydays of Patrice Chéreau and André Téchiné.
Call Me by Your Name,"Unforgettable on every level, the kind of film that has the power to move and inspire."
Call Me by Your Name,"A swirling wonder, a film about coming of age, about the secrets of youth, the magic of summer, the beauty of Italy."
Call Me by Your Name,"A powerfully erotic and affecting love story, albeit one so closely and intimately observed that the term ""slow burn"" seems almost inadequate."
Call Me by Your Name,The final beats of Guadagnino's adaptation galvanize two hours of simmering uncertainty into a gut-wrenchingly wistful portrait of two people trying to find themselves before it's too late.
Call Me by Your Name,Call Me By Your Name's erotic tension wouldn't crackle so loudly without the chemistry between its leads.
Call Me by Your Name,"It's a beautiful, supremely touching performance from Chalamet which gives this surprisingly safe story a deeply-moving purity."
Call Me by Your Name,It's not to be missed.
Call Me by Your Name,"Guadagnino, most famous for the far splashier features I Am Love and A Bigger Splash, finds exactly the right tone for the material, which is understated and filled with paternal affection."
Call Me by Your Name,"Even as he beguiles us with mystery, Guadagnino recreates Elio's life-changing summer with such intensity that we might as well be experiencing it first-hand."
Adrift,ERROR
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,"It sounds so simple. And in Unbroken: Path to Redemption, it's portrayed exactly that way. You don't need a whole movie for that kind of experience. All you have to do is read the title."
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,"Unnecessarily prolonged, and a fussy addition to a film about Zamperini that already exists."
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,Worthwhile religious movies explore the implications and the lived experience of faith or perhaps illuminate the reality of life without it. Path to Redemption has no interest in the first and isn't up to the second.
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,It is unfortunate that instead of exploring the universal challenges and complexities of forgiveness it stays within the safer confines of preaching salvation to those who have already been persuaded.
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,"There is a happy ending to the story - but, unfortunately, it doesn't arrive nearly soon enough."
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,Might stand as Cronk's least loathsome cinematic venture yet. It no doubt helps that he didn't write it.
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,There's a reason that Angelina Jolie's screen adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling Unbroken left out most of the material covered in the book's second half. It just isn't very interesting.
Unbroken: Path to Redemption,"For the most part... the script hews to the typical dramatic contours of a marriage troubled by unemployment, unresolved anger, and alcoholism-pro forma stuff, too blandly treated to inspire much more than indifference."
The 15:17 to Paris,"It's a really, really unsatisfactory film, which is a shame because the story is quite an extraordinary one."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Clint Eastwood's The 15:17 to Paris takes a taut, engrossing, and surprising nonfiction book-the most complete and genuine account of an act of real-life heroism that enthralled the whole free world-and turns it into a flaccid, bewildering docudrama."
The 15:17 to Paris,It's the second section that's really dire: a flaccid travelogue in which the boys visit landmark tourist attractions...these scenes bring the film to a grinding halt from which it never recovers.
The 15:17 to Paris,"It's a heart-pumping 15-minute or so sequence that proves that the old man's still got it, but whether it's worth the wait will depend on your level of patience."
The 15:17 to Paris,I found this to be one of Clint Eastwood's worst films. I thought the emotion was very fake.
The 15:17 to Paris,"They're all handsome but just appalling actors. This disjuncture is impossible to forget while watching the film, and it's very uncomfortable."
The 15:17 to Paris,One can't help but think that a movie chronicling Ayoub El Khazzani's journey toward that fateful day might be more interesting and useful.
The 15:17 to Paris,"Despite good intentions, the movie never lives up to the breathless excitement the real-life story promises."
The 15:17 to Paris,"It has an epic fail of a screenplay which, in a curiously heavy-handed style, anchors the events in a morass of talk about destiny. It gives off the impression of being about Christian belief but with little sense of what that means for those involved."
The 15:17 to Paris,"""The 15:17 to Paris"" suffers from an excess of dramatic wadding, and the over-all effect is too muffled and often too dull, sadly, to make an impact."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Eastwood seems to lose interest in the story as the film unfolds. And if the director doesn't care enough to make sure each take is in focus, why should we?"
The 15:17 to Paris,"One misses the prismatic structure of the 15:17 to Paris book, which fuses multiple points of view and which is reduced by Dorothy Blyskal's script to cut-and-pasted bromides."
The 15:17 to Paris,"The action sequence on the train is truly remarkable, and Eastwood shoots with a documentary-style immediacy, but the surrounding film - especially the script and performances - doesn't serve this thrilling true-life story, or the audience."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Boasting stunt casting, dull backstories, and blander-than-bland performances, Eastwood's dramatization of the real-life 2015 Thalys terrorist attack is a stunning misfire."
The 15:17 to Paris,These scenes flow like treacle and then the movie really slows down.
The 15:17 to Paris,The 15:17 to Paris shows that the 87-year-old director is still capable of surprises.
The 15:17 to Paris,It's a narrative of almost nothing interesting happening until the moment of crisis in the very last reel.
The 15:17 to Paris,A consummate work in Eastwood's filmography.
The 15:17 to Paris,"Although the terrorist attack is effectively staged, The 15:17 To Paris fails to spin a remarkable film out of a remarkable act of heroism."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Whatever its obvious limitations, the gambit of casting nonactors in the lead roles at least brings the movie a certain authenticity, but it's torpedoed by the tin-eared backstory laid out by Dorothy Blyskal's script."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Eastwood terrorist thriller casts three American heroes to play themselves. They had never acted before and as far as I'm concerned their record is clean, leaving the gripping, complex movie that might have been frustratingly out of reach."
The 15:17 to Paris,"It is, in the light of the 87-year-old's monumental career, simply the worst thing he has done (and that includes those godawful orangutan movies)."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Performances in Eastwood films are usually uneven, but here his hands-off directing style shows no mercy ..."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Minus its pivotal event, ""The 15:17 to Paris"" feels a lot like sitting through someone else's endless photo slide show: Really only interesting to the people who lived it."
The 15:17 to Paris,"A single act of heroism can truly transform a life, but that action does not necessarily make for a transformative motion picture."
The 15:17 to Paris,It's impossible to say whether The 15:17 to Paris would have been a better movie with professional actors in the lead roles. All we can do is go with what we've got.
The 15:17 to Paris,"15:17 ends with good vibes you can't trust, and the lingering sense that their real story has only just begun."
The 15:17 to Paris,"The intriguing docudrama gimmick backfires -- not just because the participants aren't particularly dynamic, but also because Eastwood's potentially novel, counterintuitive narrative approach to the material proves enervating as opposed to engrossing."
The 15:17 to Paris,"With The 15:17 to Paris, Eastwood once again tells an American story with a narrow-minded efficiency that somehow makes reality seem fake."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Eastwood will be 88 in May. If I'm doing anything when I'm 88 as well he makes movies, I'll be a very happy 88-year-old."
The 15:17 to Paris,We love stories of real-life heroics and grace under lethal pressure. But we need them to be more than the sum of their stirring intentions.
The 15:17 to Paris,"Athough Eastwood deserves credit for not going the cheesy route by drawing out the attack unnaturally, the rest of ""15:17"" is so drawn out, you almost wish he would have given into cheese."
The 15:17 to Paris,"The very averageness of these conscientious, gutsy guys is precisely the point."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Whatever he's done in the past, Eastwood here seems most interested in paying tribute to some men who deserve the commendation - nothing more, and nothing less"
The 15:17 to Paris,"A uniqueness to this film that carries it over the rough spots, past the mundane moments to a frenzied, inspiring ending."
The 15:17 to Paris,If only someone could've heroically intervened to save this movie.
The 15:17 to Paris,"Eastwood faced similar issues with his last film, ""Sully,"" and he still hasn't figured out how to take a relatively short dramatic event and build a movie around it."
The 15:17 to Paris,Another cool and subtle treatise on the nature of heroism from this American master.
The 15:17 to Paris,"Eastwood seems to be reaching for some level of realism, but when every single interaction feels like half-coded AI tried to recreate bro talk, it's clear that a mistake has been made."
The 15:17 to Paris,"A strangely boring, dramatically inert film in which the main characters remain as opaque and unreadable as sphinxes to the very last."
The 15:17 to Paris,The profanity-free squareness is close to excruciating: You won't believe how boring it is partying with real-life heroes.
The 15:17 to Paris,"A disappointing telling of a heroic story, with a commendable attention to detail highlighting narrative shortcomings."
The 15:17 to Paris,"A few minutes of nail-biting, recreated heroism isn't enough to justify the other 90-or-so minutes in Clint Eastwood's dry salute of a movie, which struggles to mix patriotism, friendship, God, and destiny into something meaningful."
The 15:17 to Paris,The heroes of the train attack deserve all the praise. But zoom out a little and it's hard not to see Eastwood's America-centric focus in The 15:17 to Paris as self-serving.
The 15:17 to Paris,"Mostly comprised of banal, drama-free, quotidian scenes that merely reinforce the men's status as regular Joes who, one day, had the opportunity for greatness thrust upon them."
The 15:17 to Paris,"The film keeps telling us that what happened aboard that train was the fulfillment of something, but neither the event nor the three actors re-enacting it seem completely real. They seem like pieces of reality trapped in a movie."
The 15:17 to Paris,"A certain blunt power is guaranteed by the facts of the story, and Mr. Eastwood doesn't obviously try for anything more than that. But his workmanlike absorption in the task at hand is precisely what makes this movie fascinating as well as moving."
The 15:17 to Paris,"Oh dear. Clint Eastwood, what have you done?"
The Leisure Seeker,Finding any comedy in aggressive diseases requires a delicacy of tone absent from this plodding adaptation of Michael Zadoorian's novel.
The Leisure Seeker,It's one of those movies that makes you feel rather sad for everyone concerned with making it.
The Leisure Seeker,[The Leisure Seeker] is a predictable scenario. It can't be anything else. But these two great talents invest it with humanity and courage in the face of its inescapable home truths.
The Leisure Seeker,The picture would be close to unbearable without the presence of Sutherland and Mirren. Neither is anywhere near his or her best.
The Leisure Seeker,The plot isn't the most depressing thing about the film. That honour goes to the fact that two such eminent actors are not getting better roles...
The Leisure Seeker,A funny and truthful look at growing old together.
The Leisure Seeker,"Plenty of scope, then, for tragedy and comedy, but Paolo Virzi's film is neither profoundly sad nor uproariously funny. It just trundles along in a cocoon of modulated mediocrity, like the Spencers in their Leisure Seeker."
The Leisure Seeker,"Sentimentality and morbidity sit side by side. Thankfully, Mirren and Sutherland bring enough mischief, humour and passion to their roles to ensure that the film's more toe-curling moments are quickly forgotten."
The Leisure Seeker,I found it sucrose and glib.
The Leisure Seeker,"Despite unconvincing dialogue, [Donald] Sutherland is great as the professor obsessed with Ernest Hemingway but [Helen] Mirren feels miscast as his chatty southern wife."
The Leisure Seeker,"Making his first American film after a 25-year career in Italy, Virzi has chosen a project whose tonal challenges would make most directors curl into a foetal ball. Even his seasoned leads wobble."
The Leisure Seeker,There are quieter moments during which the glances between Sutherland and Mirren -- containing memories better left unvoiced -- suggest something worthier than the dreck they're trapped in.
The Leisure Seeker,"[Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland] give potent and particular performances, bright buoys at sea in an otherwise nondescript picture."
The Leisure Seeker,"""The Leisure Seeker"" deserves credit for tackling a difficult subject. Unfortunately it comes packaged in a clumsy road movie headed the wrong way down the highway."
The Leisure Seeker,"Both performers are treasures; both deserve, together and separately, a better showcase than this."
The Leisure Seeker,"Sentimental, but not exactly meaningful."
The Leisure Seeker,"Sometimes an outsider's perspective is a breath of fresh air. In this one, you feel the director holding his nose."
The Leisure Seeker,The film's poignant and powerful ending does provide a saving grace.
The Leisure Seeker,"The pleasure of Mirren and Sutherland's company is considerable, but not that considerable."
The Leisure Seeker,Mirren and Sutherland can do anything - except save this sentimental drool bucket of senior cinema from driving into a predictable ditch of been-there-seen-that.
The Leisure Seeker,"Paolo Virzi's film, based on a novel by Michael Zadoorian, holds few surprises, leaving us with some enjoyable set pieces in a disappointing movie."
The Leisure Seeker,The sentiment is admirable; the execution decidedly is not.
The Leisure Seeker,"It's a sweet premise ... that isn't fleshed out well in the leaden screenplay, which leans heavily on the most obvious Americana trappings to gin up a lighter side of senility."
The Leisure Seeker,The Leisure Seeker is a pleasant distraction even though the endgame is depressing.
The Leisure Seeker,There's beauty here - Virzi is too humane to make a movie without beautiful moments. But a scattered eight or 10 minutes of splendor just isn't worth an almost two-hour investment of time.
The Leisure Seeker,"The performers are always lively, often engaging, and sometimes moving, worth our contemplation even when the script flags."
The Leisure Seeker,"There are occasional flashes of sweetness and charm, but the parts don't add up to anything substantial."
The Leisure Seeker,"No matter how likable Sutherland and Mirren are, they're still stuck in little more than an upbeat wish-fulfillment fantasy."
The Leisure Seeker,"If only the film had something to say about America-or about memory, or about families."
The Leisure Seeker,Even having tremendous actors like Sutherland and Mirren in the front seat can't enliven this vacation.
The Leisure Seeker,A soggy East Coast road trip saga in which Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland valiantly pretend that rogue treatment of debilitating illnesses has its funny/endearing side.
The Leisure Seeker,"Their picaresque journey, punctuated by campside evenings spent looking through slides of their past life, is going only one way - but these are outstanding performances, embracing age, by Sutherland and Mirren (despite a dodgy accent)."
The Leisure Seeker,It's bluntly honest ... and finds a rough-edged humour in that frankness.
The Leisure Seeker,The movie is only willing to serve up its truths halfway. And I still teared up.
The Leisure Seeker,"Cluttered with clichés and stalled in softness, pot-holed by its self-serving use of Alzheimer's as a narrative convenience."
The Leisure Seeker,"The Leisure Seeker isn't the sort of picture to start meddling with ... formula, but it sets about its business with a satisfying efficiency."
The Leisure Seeker,Not even two actors as talented as Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland can save this dreadfully predictable Alzheimer's road movie.
The Leisure Seeker,"A road movie short on comedy and drama should at least offer a keen level of observation, but here insight is scarce and emotional resonance is faint."
Molly’s Game,Jessica Chastain shows us both her resolve and her vulnerability and the scene near the end with Kevin Costner as Bloom's father is one of the best of the year.
Molly’s Game,"Overall, the film comes across as robustly offering testimony for its subject rather than really offering a portrait; it rather presents itself as a character witness for a woman of more probity and principle than her chosen career would suggest."
Molly’s Game,"Molly's Game is an entertaining and confident debut for Aaron Sorkin, even if it's definitely too long."
Molly’s Game,"I was riveted from beginning to end with Molly's Game. It has some of the best performances of the year, it has some of the best writing of the year and it has a true life story that is so vastly strange and unbelievable that it truly has to be witnessed."
Molly’s Game,"While the script crackles and excites, the film itself is profoundly uncinematic."
Molly’s Game,"Based on real events, this tale of a talented woman trying to make it in a Hollywood stacked against her gains extra currency in the post-Weinstein climate."
Molly’s Game,"Most of the arias in Molly's Game don't achieve liftoff, and so neither does the movie."
Molly’s Game,"If you're fond of Sorkin's script flourishes, then Molly's Game is for you."
Molly’s Game,"This is a ""Game"" that couldn't be more fun to watch."
Molly’s Game,Molly's Game has an engaging story with whip-snap dialogue that features Jessica Chastain in another commanding role.
Molly’s Game,"Whether we're lawyering up or narrating the drama of a night's play, it's hard to miss Sorkin's writing, but he has yet to find an equivalently distinctive style behind the camera."
Molly’s Game,"In the central role, Jessica Chastain is, quite simply, phenomenal."
Molly’s Game,"The film has a sharp and undeniable charm. Then Sorkin gambles away audience good will with a stupid, ham-fisted ice rink sequence."
Molly’s Game,"What makes Molly's Game more than an entertaining, if enjoyably familiar big-screen Sorkin-fest (whip-smart characters spouting rapid-fire dialogue while slyly revealing personality traits) is that it's a profoundly emotional film."
Molly’s Game,"If Molly's Game doesn't quite have what would typically be considered a winning hand, it bluffs just well enough to still take the pot."
Molly’s Game,"Jessica Chastain, who can swagger like the best of them, wears clothes like weapons as she powers her way towards the capitalist dream."
Molly’s Game,"Whatever artificial limitations Sorkin puts on his female characters though, he's empathetic enough to understand that Molly Bloom's story is about a woman being controlled and underestimated by a succession of presumptuous jerks."
Molly’s Game,"Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin lets rip with another marathon-sprint of exhausting and exhilarating and exasperating dialogue, in the process switching up his game to hyphenate status, and making a very stylish debut as director."
Molly’s Game,"Even though this is Sorkin's directing debut, quite a bit of the clarity comes from the visuals, annotated when necessary, precisely shot and edited with nearly every trick known to contemporary filmmaking."
Molly’s Game,"It's tempting to think of ""Molly's Game"" in poker terms: Sorkin's holding a queen, a king, and at least a couple of aces, but the tell is that he talks too much, and in the end you realize he's bluffing."
Molly’s Game,"It's a good, brash biopic. For the first hour it's very nearly terrific."
Molly’s Game,"At a certain point, everyone watching ""Molly's Game"" will form the question, ""Why should I care about any of this?"" It's a question Sorkin should have anticipated. He has no good answer."
Molly’s Game,"Few actors on the planet can shift gears as effortlessly as Chastain, who perfectly captures Molly's chameleon-like ability to adapt to situations and to rationalize her worst behavior."
Molly’s Game,"It's fun enough to watch Chastain's Bloom find her way, making things up she goes along."
Molly’s Game,"Its main recommendation, aside from the brilliance of Chastain, is Sorkin's ingeniously crafted screenplay."
Molly’s Game,"Chastain is always worth watching, and so is Elba, but I wanted more from this film, and Molly's Game left me dissatisfied."
Molly’s Game,"It's verbose, superficial, convoluted, and addictively watchable. In other words, it's another Aaron Sorkin project."
Molly’s Game,"It's an intriguing look into a secret world and a great performance from Chastain, but Sorkin's directorial debut never quite makes the leap from great poker movie to great movie."
Molly’s Game,"The quality of the screenplay takes a back seat to its quantity, and the direction never brings it to life."
Molly’s Game,"Despite Ms. Chastain's charisma and gift for delivering Mr. Sorkin's fast talk, Molly isn't interesting."
Molly’s Game,"It's all good stuff, delivered by a director who knows how to get the most out of performers speaking his words."
Molly’s Game,"Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut gives ""poker queen"" Molly Bloom the royal treatment she deserves. Star Jessica Chastain proves as eloquent in silence as she does in speech and deals audiences a winning hand."
Molly’s Game,"Nothing and no one seems to be holding [Sorkin] back, for better and for worse."
Molly’s Game,"Chastain draws us so deeply into Molly's lightning-speed thought processes that you can almost see her synapses firing, making ""Molly's Game"" not just a biographical portrait but a genuine thriller of the mind."
Molly’s Game,"Sorkin's reputation for crisp, rat-a-tat dialogue is well deserved, and he has an intriguing protagonist in Chastain's Molly Bloom."
Molly’s Game,"Word-pusher Aaron Sorkin makes his debut as a director, and whaddya know, he directs a lot like he writes: fast and smooth, bordering on slick. But just bordering, because love demands sincerity, and he's found someone to love in Molly Bloom"
Molly’s Game,"Words and cards are dealt in equal hand with Aaron Sorkin's poker drama Molly's Game, featuring Jessica Chastain at the center of a compelling film about fame, power and empathy."
Molly’s Game,"Sorkin, directing for the first time, has made an outrageously self-righteous thriller."
Molly’s Game,"Chastain gives everything as Molly -- including an up-for-it nakedness of emotion when required -- but ""everything"" is what becomes, finally, wearing."
Molly’s Game,"Chastain, who's in nearly every frame of the film, delivers an impressively intense, hammered-down performance."
Molly’s Game,"A sharply judged edit stitches together three separate timelines, shaping Molly as a complex and razor-sharp character in a world dominated by entitled mansplainers. Forget Rounders -- here's a poker movie to go all-in on."
Molly’s Game,"Ms. Chastain has burnished a reputation as a passionate actress (""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""The Tree of Life"") who's also brilliant technically, and this adds to it; the burnishing here has less depth than gloss, but that's the nature of her character."
Molly’s Game,"""Molly's Game,"" the new high-stakes poker movie, is a pretty safe bet."
Molly’s Game,The movie version of a card player who doesn't know how to quit when she's ahead.
Molly’s Game,What Molly's Game portrays best is the absolute vulnerability of women who attempt to enter the dens of men.
Molly’s Game,"Overall, Molly's Game is a crackerjack, quintessential holiday movie. Smart, engaging, and full of great performances, sometimes telling is the way to go."
Molly’s Game,This is that rare instance of a filmmaker benefiting from his own self-indulgence.
Molly’s Game,"""Molly's Game"" is worth the ante: It pays off, both as slick, adult-oriented entertainment and morality tale."
Molly’s Game,"""Molly's Game"" could have been a terrific movie if Sorkin could have edited out 20-30 minutes; as it is, it's a good movie overstuffed."
Molly’s Game,"It's tempting to say that the real star here is Sorkin, since he's put the dialogue so front and center, basing the film on it. But that's not true. Chastain is the real draw."
Molly’s Game,"A storming directorial debut from Sorkin, whose impeccable cast and thrilling narrative make this an instant classic."
Molly’s Game,"A game that lacks aggression, and a goofiness that should be more enjoyable."
Molly’s Game,"It's too bad that Chastain's heady, exquisitely subtle performance is dragged down by the laughably vehement male characters that seek to speak for her."
Molly’s Game,"As a director, Sorkin mostly (and wisely) stays out of the way of his screenplay, composing shots with an eye toward how they'll likely be shaped in the editing room, based primarily on verbal rhythms."
Molly’s Game,"There's no nuance, no reflective downtime, and it ends with what may be the worst cod-psychology scene of all time. It all comes down to daddy issues, apparently. Oh, boo-hoo."
Molly’s Game,"Few screenwriters are quite so in love with their own prose as Sorkin; on and on it goes, faster than the speed of screwball but with none of the wit. Molly's Game is his directing debut but he's a dead loss."
Molly’s Game,"'Molly's Game' is smart and funny, and though there are a couple of typical Sorkin #problematic moments, they're fleeting. This is a major step forward, for both the first-time director and his talented star."
Molly’s Game,"It's often a zippy, fun time, however-that is, if you can convince yourself to overlook its self-congratulation and mildly regressive gender politics."
Molly’s Game,"[Aaron] Sorkin's script, which is based on the real-life Molly's memoir, has way too much dialogue and too many voice-overs for the genre. Stick with it. It builds to a worthy climax regardless."
Molly’s Game,"When Molly's Game digs into the business of gambling and the whims and vulnerabilities of powerful men who spend mountains of money trying to one-up each other, it is witty, gossipy, and very entertaining."
Molly’s Game,"Sorkin has made a canny, disjointed thriller of process and exposition, a sort of Goodfellas riff with a nerdy twist."
Molly’s Game,"... a typically staccato and silver-tongued drama that boasts a zillion killer lines, at least two of the year's most exciting performances, and a rare understanding of the difference between power and pride."
Molly’s Game,The frequent pleasures of Molly's Game more than make up for the occasional lapse into Sorkin indulgence.
Molly’s Game,The dialogue is paced at about the intensity of a jackhammer and every other sentence uttered ends on a twist of the one that came before it.
Molly’s Game,"It's glorious to see [Idris] Elba working with great dialogue, but the movie belongs to [Jessica] Chastain, who throws herself into this role with abandon and vigor, and sells it completely."
Molly’s Game,"Aaron Sorkin deep dives into self-parody from the opening moments of his directorial debut, Molly's Game."
Molly’s Game,"There's a lot missing in Molly's Game, especially regarding its protagonist's personal relationships. But what's there is dandy."
Molly’s Game,"Ferociously eloquent, densely packed with ideas, immensely entertaining, Molly's Game is a film which fetishes power and success, while also serving as a cautionary tale."
Molly’s Game,"The experience of watching Molly's Game feels a bit like hearing a long, rambling story from someone high on something, a frantic, exhausting splurge of information that never truly justifies its existence."
Molly’s Game,"In his overdue directorial debut, Sorkin both entertains and makes you lean in to absorb every detail of this wild tale, which boasts a stellar cast to help tell it."
Molly’s Game,"A dense, dynamic, compulsively entertaining affair, whose central role makes stunning use of Chastain's stratospheric talent."
Forever My Girl,There is more pleasure to be had in the dwindling returns of CMT's Nashville than in this country soap-opera.
Forever My Girl,The lead actors are very pretty.
Forever My Girl,"It all feels a little bit off, as if every third scene was cut out randomly, and every camera angle came down to a fourth choice."
Forever My Girl,Sentimental dreck of the fluffiest order.
Forever My Girl,"""Forever My Girl"" is barely a step above a Lifetime movie."
Forever My Girl,"The problem is not the well-worn plot or familiar characters, but the fact that Wolf adds no depth or complication to either that would make the film her own."
Forever My Girl,"For an audience, seeking fluffy, escapist, country music-tinged romance, it'll hit a sweet spot."
Forever My Girl,"Rothe was a standout in last year's horror comedy Happy Death Day, but the Denver-born actor's performance here as Josie is as coolly bland as overnight oats."
Forever My Girl,"Bethany Ashton Wolf's Forever My Girl is less reminiscent of a country song than of Radiohead's ""True Love Waits."""
Forever My Girl,"Pretty people with pretty problems will always be playing on a screen somewhere, but this one is better suited for watching while folding laundry."
Forever My Girl,A by-the-book redemption story for a guy who hardly deserves it.
Forever My Girl,"Roe and Rothe are nice enough to look at, but together, there's no spark, and separate, little evidence of an interior life."
Forever My Girl,"The country-fried romance written and directed by Bethany Ashton Wolf becomes a victim of self sabotage as it nears its (predictable) conclusion, removing any good will it created in its first half."
Forever My Girl,"Just about anyone with a level head would see ""Forever My Girl"" as the story of a narcissist manipulating a naive doormat."
Forever My Girl,"""Forever My Girl"" is a bad movie, pure and simple."
Forever My Girl,"Call this schmaltzy romantic drama Nicholas Sparks Lite, and you won't be far off the mark."
Forever My Girl,"The two leads are both highly appealing, with Roe credible as a country music superstar."
Forever My Girl,"A Hallmark movie would have at least given the female lead something of a personality and plot arc; this movie's all about the celebrity and his emotional journey, while the woman stands around like a prize waiting to be won, the Blessed Hometown Honey."
Forever My Girl,"Wolf is a Louisiana native and obviously loves her location work, but not enough to imbue the writing or visuals with any life."
Forever My Girl,"Wolf establishes only a half-formed idea of the decisions, fights, and silences that have shaped these characters' lives, so the cast often seems to be shouting into a vacuum."
God Bless the Broken Road,"After nearly two hours of plodding storytelling, and despite an affecting performance by Pulsipher, we know nothing about Amber other than her difficult circumstances and maybe the fact that she likes Rascal Flatts and Scrabble."
God Bless the Broken Road,What remains unchanged about the director and his team is that craftsmanship is obviously not a critical concern for them.
God Bless the Broken Road,Reverence for God and the church: Check. Patriotism and the highest regard for military service: Check. Country music: Check. NASCAR racing: Check... The only thing missing from God Bless the Broken Road is compelling or believable drama.
God Bless the Broken Road,The characters for the most part play inspirational pawns more than three-dimensional people.
God Bless the Broken Road,"Like nine out of 10 faith-based films, it lets the message crowd out the other elements of good art: character development, thematic complexity, even basics such as a compelling conflict."
Darkest Hour,ERROR
Wonder,ERROR
The Post,"Probably puts too much effort into complicating and over-complicating its central mystery and not enough into editing for pace, suspense and simple “hold my interest” contingencies."
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,The greatest offense of the God's Not Dead series may be its failure to imagine for its audience what a truly radical belief in a living God would look like.
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,"To its credit, this third GND installment earnestly attempts to give some degree of lip service to diverging perspectives on the socio-religious-political scale without too much proselytizing, although there's never any question about whose side it's on."
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,"God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness isn't just the conclusion of the most successful film trilogy made for the evangelical market, it's the first time a Facebook argument has metastasized into a movie."
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,"It features all of the familiar elements from the two previous films: a persecution-complex, an 'us vs. them' attitude, and visions of the brave faithful going up against a hostile secular society."
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,"The third chapter in the conservative Evangelical franchise known for its flabbergasting box office success might have learned some Christian humility. OK, not much humility. But on this map's legend, an inch equals a mile."
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,"A Light In Darkness isn't as offensive as the first film-it lacks the requisite misogyny and Islamophobia, and does a better job of looking like it's almost a real movie-but it's not far behind, an emblematic film for the foul moment."
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,"Less strident than the two surprise hits that preceded it, but it still tells a programmatic story, rooted in presumptions."
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,These movies are fundamentalist propaganda aimed at people who are convinced their religion is under attack in this country just because it doesn't exempt them from the Constitution.
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,"While God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness proves less fiery in its preaching than its predecessors, it's also a significantly duller offering."
God’s Not Dead: A Light in …,"Corbett reminds you what a corny-sly actor he can be, and the back-and-forth between Dave and Pearce doesn't feel rigged. It's the sound of two brothers with deep roots who can't bear, on some level, to think that they've grown this far apart."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","A somber, moving portrait of one of the early church's most significant figures, who led the way at a time when Christians were being burned alive in the streets of Rome, or condemned to death in the arena."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","Largely devoid of sensationalism, a film that delves quietly into substantive issues of belief and forgiveness."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","Fails to fully develop the stakes at hand, but it features more thoughtful world-building than most faith-based films, as well as a bracing honesty about the difficulty of reconciling idealistic credos with a harsh and unforgiving world."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ",A few minutes of thriller-like tension early on gives way to a lot of tediously scripted scenes of whisper-acting that rarely breathe life and humanity into what should be a potent turning point story in a religion's history.
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","The film's simple, redundant, but valuable moral lesson to its audience finds comfortable enough expression in an aesthetic that's banal but impressively consistent."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","Caviezel gives a stoic performance as the brave and selfless Luke. Lynch and Whalley are excellent as the husband and wife Christian community leaders Aquila and Priscilla. Costumes, sets, cinematography and editing are all first-rate."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","""Paul, Apostle of Christ"" struggles to find a compelling entry point to a critical period in the early Christian church ..."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ",The most dramatically and thematically interesting material emerges from the agonized deliberations of the Roman Christians ... the prospect and the plausibility of violence in the name of Christ is treated with a level of complexity welcome in such a film.
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","It's as if Scorsese had devoted an entire feature to Jake LaMotta as a fat dude working on his comedy routine, with the occasional fleeting flashback to the ring."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","""Paul, Apostle of Christ"" offers both solace and a bracing, even revolutionary, challenge."
"Paul, Apostle of Christ",A film that labours hard under the weight of its earnest intentions.
"Paul, Apostle of Christ","All this Italian-set melodrama feels hokey, cooked up and, in the end, not what we want to be seeing."
Indivisible,It would be more at home in the rec rooms of churches than in movie theaters.
Indivisible,"What's refreshing about ""Indivisible,"" co-written by Evans, Cheryl McKay and Peter White, is the way it balances the narratives of the troops away at war and the family members who stay at home."
Indivisible,"Although the film has a few battle sequences, it portrays soldiers as sensitive men and women with complex feelings who depend on each other for emotional support as they ponder the philosophical ramifications of death."
Indivisible,"An arresting faith-based drama about a crisis of faith, set against the 2007 troop surge of the Iraq War."
Indivisible,"Middling production values, a sluggish script and low-energy performances make ""Indivisible"" a less-than-riveting experience."
Disobedience,ERROR
Mid90s,An earnest effort that nonetheless relies too heavily on gimmicks.
Mid90s,"The attempts at authentic stoner dialogue soon become tedious, with too little plot or character development grounding the inanity."
Mid90s,Lending the film considerable ballast is an affecting performance by Sunny Suljic.
Mid90s,"Mid90s is alive to the debauchery and obnoxiousness of teenagers, but also to their warmth and loyalty."
Mid90s,Mid90s feels like a male retort to Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird or Crystal Moselle's Skate Kitchen.
Mid90s,"Hill has come up with an accomplished and watchable film in this style, nearly a pastiche..."
Mid90s,"Mid90s cares less about making you laugh than enveloping you in the moment, even when the moments consist of nothing more than killed time - daft small talk, the lazy throb of hip hop, the therapeutic purr and slap of skateboard wheels on concrete."
Mid90s,"The dingy cinematography and abrasive score scream authenticity, but Mid90s hits every last beat of the coming-of-age movie... Mostly the film strives desperately for effect over logic."
Mid90s,"It's not perfect but Hill captures the anger, pain, bliss, sadness, thrill and confusion of growing up so beautifully that the abrupt 84-minute running time leaves you feeling bereft."
Mid90s,"Hill captures the eternally strange cultural place of skateboarding - marginal even while inspiring high-gloss ad campaigns, practised in derelict urban spaces."
Mid90s,"The dramatic third act is a tad Hollywood, but this is a lot of fun."
Mid90s,"mid90s is funny, observant and true. If the Wu Tang Clan and Ren & Stimpy references don't resonate, the portrait of finding your people and them schooling you in the world will."
Mid90s,"Mid90s, the first feature directed by actor Jonah Hill, is, in many ways, a remarkable debut."
Mid90s,Truly outstanding.
Mid90s,"If Superbad launched an entire subgenre that mocks male insecurity, Mid90s reveals, almost tenderly, the devastation of trying to hide it."
Mid90s,"The film has a sketchbook quality, but Hill does something very difficult: he sustains the alternation of intense claustrophobia and release."
Mid90s,"The drama is heartfelt but thin; despite some sharp and swift dialogue, the characters are bound to a defining trait or two, and there's little sense of style to lift the action past obvious intentions."
Mid90s,The issue is that I'm not entirely certain Hill has any concept of what it is he's showing or why it is so disconcerting.
Mid90s,"It's hard to tell if Hill is boldly refusing to adopt a point of view regarding dysfunction and its discontents, or if he just isn't quite sure what to make of it."
Mid90s,"For most of the ride, Mid90s feels like an accurate time capsule - and a relatable journey even if you've never been on a skateboard in your life."
Mid90s,"Mid90s uses a super-uncomfortable sex scene to make its young protagonist cool, because of course it does."
Mid90s,"At just 84 minutes, ""Mid90s"" feels brief, like a sketch rather than a full painting. But Hill is finding his footing, landing one trick at a time, and he's off to a strong start."
Mid90s,"It just observes, as young rebel movies have since the dawn of cinema, that life is something that happens while you're busy trying to skate around it."
Mid90s,A tender glance back at adolescence that dodges the kind of generational nostalgia suggested by the title.
Mid90s,"Though not everyone will be able to connect to the time and story on a personal level, it's extremely well done and feels real. That's the highest compliment I could pay to any first-time writer and director-even one as well-known as Jonah Hill"
Mid90s,"Not a lot happens in ""Mid90s"" but as a slice of teenage life, it feels almost like a documentary from that time, full of well-observed - if foul-mouthed and sometimes dangerous - moments that ring true."
Mid90s,"""Mid90s"" is not brimming with plot, but there isn't a frame in which we don't feel transported to another time."
Mid90s,"A terrific coming-of-age film from first-time director Jonah Hill. Sharp-eyed, tender and wise."
Mid90s,"It's as if Hill took his familiar sly humor and sneaked it into a segment from Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood."""
Mid90s,"Though affectionately and sometimes precisely recalled, Jonah Hill's thinly sketched directorial debut ""Mid90s"" feels both sincerely personal and highly derivative at once."
Mid90s,"Hill isn't offering a sociological treatise. ""Mid90s"" is all about lived experience. It's about a place and a time and offers little inkling of its characters' futures."
Mid90s,Writer-director Jonah Hill shows the joy and warmth that comes in finding true kindred spirits in a pre-social media era.
Mid90s,"There's a level above pure documentation, above assembling the relics of a different era and cataloging them across the space of a screen, and Hill never reaches it."
Mid90s,"What works best about Mid90s is what's casual about it-but what makes it verge on being genuinely original is all the weirdo stuff at the margins, which is too pronounced to be subtext and too minimally handled to really mean something to the movie."
Mid90s,"Mid90s doesn't entirely work, but it shows some promise, and even some guts."
Mid90s,The film's rough edges sometimes feel like a first draft.
Mid90s,Offers zero insight
Mid90s,"Hill is content to coast like Stevie toward a pink-hued horizon, hoping the pavement isn't too bumpy. The movie is nostalgia, pure and simple, unfettered by examination."
Mid90s,Mid90s just looks like a poser.
Mid90s,"Hill envisions these endless days with a kid's-eye abstraction that's both timeless and firmly entrenched in its own era: his skate punks banter like Kevin Smith extras, wander like Richard Linklater dreamers, and misbehave like Larry Clark lost boys."
Mid90s,"It longs to be received as an impeccable found artifact of its chosen decade, but also as a sly, knowing synthesis of its many obvious influences."
Mid90s,"The best period pieces, like Dazed and Confused or American Graffiti or Diner - to name three... influences on Mid90s - address the past with an eye toward an uncertain and troubling future. Hill cares merely to memorialize it."
Mid90s,Incessant '90s shout-outs weigh down Jonah Hill's empathetic drama about skateboarding teens.
Mid90s,"explores the violent initiations of boys into manhood against the backdrop of a laid-back LA skate shop crew... quickly, this coming-of-age film becomes body horror."
Mid90s,"It's a movie about making choices in tough circumstances, and for the most part Hill makes pretty good ones."
Mid90s,Hill may well turn out to have a growing talent for directing. But he needs to match his subtler insights to a script that feels less derivative.
Mid90s,"Jonah Hill's directorial debut, from a script he wrote himself, rewinds back to Clinton-era L.A., where a young kid gets an education in sex, drugs and skaterat culture. The result feels rough-hewn, hands-on and totally irresistible."
Mid90s,"Mid90s, for all its darkness, is uplifted by its hilarious moments and joyous skating shots - filmed on Super 16, set to the golden Californian soundtrack of The Mamas & the Papas."
Mid90s,"Mid90s is more than an exercise in refracting the nostalgic radiance of its cultural touchstones. It's something both rougher and more tender, and still a little bit unformed."
Mid90s,"Hill is too smart to mistake nostalgia and signifiers for storytelling. Instead, he makes Mid90s resonate with universal poignancy and electric energy; his kids are the best, messiest kind of real, and they're alright."
Mid90s,"The cast is mostly skaters, not actors, but they're persuasive as pals, and Hill is clearly having fun."
Mid90s,"What makes Mid90s an endlessly enjoyable, uplifting debut rather than a tragically melodramatic dud is its spirit: a higher pitch, a louder cheer and faster legs, at 13 years old Stevie is an invigorating, unapologetic, chutzpah-ridden force of nature."
Mid90s,"Hill's understated eye as a director is given its moment to shine... Then the story starts up again, and we're left wondering what Mid90s might have been if it had only had the confidence to do more by saying less."
Mid90s,"Hill's directorial debut is aggressively mediocre, especially coming in the wake the heart-wrenchingly authentic Eighth Grade and the riveting Skate Kitchen..."
Mid90s,"This is classic rites-of-passage fare, but mid90s is executed with some real flair, most noticeable on the soundtrack."
Mid90s,"The nihilistic rebelliousness of the film's teens is obviously indebted to Kids, but Jonah Hill cannot commit to Larry Clark's brand of defiant bleakness."
Mid90s,Hill shows his caution sometimes comically but also with preciousness in how he handles Na-Kel Smith's Ray.
Mid90s,"Mid90s is a scrappy triumph, with heart, soul and a boundless sense of adolescent energy."
Mid90s,"A great feature directorial debut for Jonah Hill. The movie rocks an all-consuming slice of life vibe. An extremely charming, raw coming of age story with a strong tinge of sadness."
Mid90s,The best thing I can say about Mid90s is that Hill gets what it means to want to be cool. It's ironic that this is his debut's greatest liability.
Mid90s,Hill comes straight out of the gate here with a minor masterpiece.
Mid90s,"'mid90s' is mostly about the strange, grown-up sensation of learning that your idols are human and fallible."
Mid90s,"The first feature from writer-director Jonah Hill shows some of the best qualities of veteran actors who step behind the camera, with nuanced performances so real the characters practically fall off the screen."
Mid90s,A gem that feels simultaneously informed by its author's adolescence and the product of a serious artist's observational distance.
Mid90s,A slice of street life made up of skittery moments that achieve a bone-deep reality.
Life Itself,Every big dramatic moment is sapped of all its energy entirely.
Life Itself,The film's indulgences are so heart-on-sleeve that it's hard to differentiate watching it from hearing someone pitch their very bad screenplay ideas with no attempt to read the room...
Life Itself,"Despite the suffering ladled on to the characters, I remained stonily unmoved throughout."
Life Itself,"Confused, cliched and meandering to the point of incoherence. Everyone involved with this is capable of far better, but sadly this mess of a film cannot be redeemed by any of them."
Life Itself,"Wilde and Isaac are a chemistry-free coupling, which doesn't help, but Will and Abby are also fingers-down-the-blackboard awful."
Life Itself,Half an hour in (if you're generous) and you'll realise you don't give a hoot about any of them. Avoid.
Life Itself,It's quite a feat for a film to feel this dated upon initial release.
Life Itself,"Despite good moments and an ambition to reach for the profound, Life Itself settles for trite, sentimental and patience testing. A killer cast deserve better."
Life Itself,The film continually draws attention to its own devices and tricks its audience.
Life Itself,"Fogelman takes on more than he can chew and hands to us the semi-masticated pulp, full of fatuous musings on Life's Meaning."
Life Itself,"The attempt by Life Itself to pretend it's anything other than another piece of ""Nice men have feelings too, love us for being so nice!"" propaganda is just exhausting."
Life Itself,"Fogelman's work is a little like listening to James Taylor's ""Fire and Rain"" while shopping for candles in a Pier One: It never stops to question its economic comfort, its upper-class value system, or its essential whiteness."
Life Itself,Excruciatingly contrived and ill-conceived...
Life Itself,"Even in failure, it's clear that Fogelman has talent and can work with actors - it's just that his story is so unwieldy that it doesn't allow us to relate to his characters."
Life Itself,"Fogelman wants audiences to feel his love, but the only tools at his disposal are sap and cheese, which he hits viewers with like an errant bus driver."
Life Itself,"Relentlessly cruel, unbelievably cloying, unabashedly sentimental and frustratingly facile."
Life Itself,"It's a movie made for people who can't be trusted to understand any storytelling unless it's not just spoon-fed but ladled on, piled high, and explained via montage and voiceover."
Life Itself,There is about as much honesty and genuine emotion in this film as you would find in a damage-control ExxonMobil commercial.
Life Itself,The less said about Life Itself -- a truly zany multi-timeline melodrama from the creator of that NBC show that makes everyone cry -- the better.
Life Itself,"In Life Itself, everyone's fate is in the hands of Fogelman, and he wields that power with terrible cruelty."
Life Itself,"The worst thing about Life Itself is not that it is emotionally sadistic. It's just how much it wants to be emotionally sadistic, while missing the mark by a mile."
Life Itself,"Overall, his movie feels like an entire season of This Is Us compressed into two frustratingly uneven hours of tearjerking and grief porn."
Life Itself,"If you are up for a good cry - in fact, if you crave one - you will probably get it. But it may be more of a reflex than anything."
Life Itself,"I've seen Life Itself twice already, and I may even watch it a third time someday, not because it's perfect-it isn't-but because just as with my own life, I like to revisit the high points."
Life Itself,"Life Itself... comes across as a ghoulish, five-alarm fire of a movie."
Life Itself,The whole film is rather consumed with itself...
Life Itself,What the viewer is left with... is the curious sensation of having just watched a ninety-minute prologue to something that they're no longer interested in.
Life Itself,"Much like life itself, This Is Us creator Fogelman's decades-spanning, multigenerational mashup of intertwined, tragic romances is, in the end, much ado about nothing much at all."
Life Itself,"So perversely jaw-dropping in its attempts to extort feelings out of us that it could almost be a black comedy. But no, this one is playing it straight."
Life Itself,"Fogelman's ""Life Itself"" seems to include almost every single thought and feeling he has ever had."
Life Itself,"A glib, noxious, airplane-unworthy melodrama so insecure about its time-hopping, tragedy-strewn events and heart-stricken characters that, in its naked manipulation and narrative condescension, it resembles anything but the words of its title."
Life Itself,Life Itself feels weighted down by its sense of self-importance.
Life Itself,Dan Fogelman's blithering botch job doesn't rate a single star. Try five eyerolls. A talented cast goes up in a hellish blaze of leaden dialogue that lands like a blunt force trauma. But the real tragedy strikes when you buy a ticket.
Life Itself,"Despite its title, Life Itself doesn't revel so much in the joys and travails of life as it does in the shameless emotional manipulation stemming from the ham-fisted tendencies of its own maker."
Life Itself,"Too many stray touches here belong to a Fidelity Investments ad, or a pushy yet empathetic marketing campaign for a pain reliever."
Life Itself,"Movies should invite viewers in, taking them on a journey together with the characters on-screen. Unfortunately, ""Life Itself"" is less journey than lecture."
Life Itself,"Isn't it amazing how human destinies intertwine? This movie seems intent on persuading you that the answer is ""no."""
Life Itself,A stuffed turkey that wastes most of its noteworthy ingredients...
Life Itself,An overwrought tearjerker that shoves trite life lessons down your throat along with a vat of sugar.
Life Itself,"Though you wouldn't know it from its gauzy marketing, Life Itself is an R-rated film with several incredibly jarring moments of bloody violence."
Life Itself,"Life, it seems, can be summarized as Terrible Things Keep Happening to Nice, Attractive People, Especially the Women."
Life Itself,A vapid exercise in narrative kitsch that spans two languages and multiple decades and love stories.
Life Itself,It's actually funny that Fogelman enjoys referencing Tarantino so much in this movie because the script kills off more characters than Reservoir Dogs.
Life Itself,"""Life Itself"" is one of the worst kind of bad movies, because it achieves nothing that it sets out to do."
Life Itself,"To describe its plot in detail is to betray the game of the film, but suffice it to say that the sum of its parts are exhilarating."
Life Itself,"As evidenced by the title, Life Itself has grand ambitions... What it actually delivers, though, is a big sloppy pile of WTF."
Life Itself,"The movie wants so desperately to be clever, and just comes off looking lame. All this adds up to a film that thinks it's being charming and inspiring, but is instead merely a cruel joke on its audience."
Life Itself,You rarely get the sense of Fogelman's characters being complex figures with internal lives - instead they're merely there to smile weakly through whatever trauma their sadistic creator puts them through.
Life Itself,Life Itself plays like a soap opera squeezed into two hours.
Life Itself,"It is sentimental and sprawling, which are not necessarily bad things, but also manipulative and contrived, which very much are."
Life Itself,It's both schematic and self-important.

"Love, Simon",How nice it is to see that representation is presented as so normal.
"Love, Simon","It's too sanded down to ever truly snag on something like a real, specific, visceral emotion, but it's got the pop-chorus bombast that will get you to some kind of objective sense of fireworks, one way or another."

"Love, Simon","As a piece of filmmaking craft, it's competent, if unremarkable...if Love, Simon helps even one gay teen come to terms with their sexuality, in the friendly confines of familiar movie formulas, hey, it was probably worth it."
"Love, Simon","It's a premise that understands a the key takeaways of the closet, which is that sexuality is a valuable piece of intel. It's also a nice springboard for a few valuable life lessons about friendship and integrity, and a handful of strong performances."
"Love, Simon","Greg Berlanti's groundbreaking gay romcom is an exuberant gift, a John Hughes movie for audiences who just got woke and the first mainstream studio release to put a closeted teen front and center."
"Love, Simon","As the romantic mystery develops, the light comedy keeps us amused."
"Love, Simon","Every kid out there can determine whether or not they need this film, but each of them absolutely deserves a confection this sweet, thoughtful, and sincere."
"Love, Simon","The story's lightness is, in a sense, the source of its charm."
"Love, Simon","Love, Simon has a few sad moments as Simon's mistakes come crashing down around him, but mostly it's a sweet, funny, warm-hearted film."
"Love, Simon","Love, Simon is filled with humor-in its characters, dialogue, and situations-but it doesn't sacrifice emotional depth. The two work in tandem."
"Love, Simon","It's a warm-but-thin rom-com that isn't particularly noteworthy outside of its trailblazing subject matter. Its heart is in the right place, however, which gives it a light stamp of approval."
"Love, Simon",I can't remember when I've heard an audience respond with cheers and applause as joyous as they did here when the big kiss moment finally arrived.
"Love, Simon","As a consumer, it is simply your responsibility to see it, just so that many more Love, Simons can be made."
"Love, Simon","Young and old, jocks and nerds, geeks and freaks, and everyone in between should be able to find something to adore in Love, Simon."
"Love, Simon","With a slight adjustment for gender, the lyrics of a classic Gershwin song could sum up the plot of ""Love, Simon."""
"Love, Simon","While the romance elements of Love, Simon will earn it headlines and, perhaps more importantly, butts-in-seats, it's the film's quieter, deeper coming-out storyline that forms its true emotional center."
"Love, Simon","The casting is high quality, the script - with a tantalizing mystery at its heart - is particularly well-crafted and the story hits all the right emotional notes in delivering a funny, warm-hearted and life-affirming tale."
"Love, Simon","The emotional resonance may be surprising given the movie's relentless gloss, but it's real."
"Love, Simon",It really does get better - at the movies anyway.
"Love, Simon","""Love, Simon"" is a sweet, modern romantic comedy that manages to channel the teen movie classics of the late John Hughes, but only the good stuff."
"Love, Simon","The movie is well-made and likable, without any major missteps. It's also just a little bland."
"Love, Simon","The movie ... speaks to another, more precious kind of privilege, one that straight kids have had since movies began: the right to a romantic fantasy served up like ice cream, tart and sweet."
"Love, Simon","It takes what could have been a teen-movie cliché stacked on top of a coming-out cliché like stale wedding cake and turns them into something that feels fresh, even while not saying anything particularly revelatory."
"Love, Simon","There may be little in this movie that you haven't seen before, but the perspective through which you're seeing it can make all the difference."
"Love, Simon","""Love, Simon"" exists on a spectrum between ""Lady Bird"" and ""Mean Girls."" It has the warm winsomeness of ""Lady Bird"" and the crackling humor of ""Mean Girls,"" playing with the high school archetypes that film captured so well."
"Love, Simon",Nick Robinson crafts an immensely likeable Simon - as appealing as any of the teenage protagonists in a John Hughes comedy.
"Love, Simon","Faults aside, there's something truly revolutionary about this big-screen Romeo and Romeo romance, as Simon courts an anonymous closeted schoolmate he's met online in the hope of one day meeting him."
"Love, Simon",It's hard for find fault with any film that addresses a changing teenage world with such compassion and decency. An unexpected delight in more ways than one.
"Love, Simon","Though it tells an emotional story about identity and coming out, it's an easygoing movie, glossy and kind and cozily corny. And yet, for me, it was also a fraught experience, both pained and giddy, cheering and dismaying. It's a lot, this little movie."
"Love, Simon","This film treats 17-year-old Simon Spier's quest for love and self-acceptance with the tender, timeless, Hollywood touch of John Hughes: It's a classic story of a first crush made groundbreaking by centering on a closeted gay kid."
"Love, Simon","The element that keeps ""Love, Simon"" from fully realizing its potential is that it feels like something you'd see on TV. And not on TV in 2018 - TV you'd see in the 1980s."
"Love, Simon","If what teens watch on their screens shapes future teen behavior, Love, Simon's utopian society is a gift to the teens of the future who may grow up on it - and to anyone who has to deal with teens."
"Love, Simon","How refreshing to see a teen boy on a big screen that's not a sleepy-eyed, monosyllabic jerk just hoping to get laid."
"Love, Simon","Love, Simon is the kind of movie you could easily catch up with on cable TV years later and forget just as quickly-but even that's a kind of step forward."
"Love, Simon","Kids like Simon, in 2018, already have a good shot of fitting in. They don't need this movie."
"Love, Simon","The dialogue didn't feel forced; it was charming, witty and extremely relatable."
"Love, Simon","""Love, Simon"" never feels like it exists merely because it should; its endearing charm makes it a film that viewers will watch regardless of its valuable social impact."
"Love, Simon","But Love, Simon's greatest triumph is that it manages to highlight the small ways in which even the most accepting and open-minded among us can make coming out difficult, even in 2018."
"Love, Simon",Greg Berlanti's charmingly heartfelt film is a remarkably successful attempt to give shape to the experience of the closet by drawing an incredibly intimate portrait of a teenage boy about to leave it behind.
"Love, Simon","Love, Simon is touching as a gesture. As entertainment, it's nothing Degrassi hasn't done better."
"Love, Simon","It's too bad that the movie isn't as vibrant, funny, and entertaining as the community it wishes to represent - but it's a start."
"Love, Simon","Love, Simon won't be short of critics (and many of them will be adamant that its story is either unimportant or, gasp, amoral) but within its sleek studio skeleton, there's genuine heart."
"Love, Simon","At a cultural moment when it matters so much for audiences to see themselves represented on screen, ""Love, Simon"" broadens the spectrum to include those who are questioning their sexuality."
"Love, Simon","It's an expertly carved chunk of cheese. But taken on its own, limited terms, Love, Simon is also a charmer - warm, often funny and gently touching, tickling rather than pummeling your tear ducts."
"Love, Simon","There's a place in the culture for adolescent gay kids to enjoy the shiny, shallow coming-of-age stories that their straight peers consume on a daily basis. The first one out of the gate always plays it safe; the trick now is to keep the gate open."
Midnight Sun,"The ending of Midnight Sun is more of an eyeroller than a tearjerker. This film will have a very particular audience, and you'll know if you're a member of it. If not, stay away."
Midnight Sun,"Forced to act beside this handsome stick of furniture, Bela Thorne, who sings bland songs and delivers blander dialogue as Katy Price, comes across as the reincarnation of both Barbara Stanwyck and Judy Garland. She's grand. She'll survive."
Midnight Sun,A disappointing production which could have benefited from a better screenplay.
Midnight Sun,"Laughably predictable, far too tempered to generate any tearjerking stakes worth caring about."
Midnight Sun,"The ""sick lit"" genre gets a crushingly bad new addition...spectacularly uninspired stuff."
Midnight Sun,The storytelling is so soft-centred that it has melted into mush long before Katie is exposed to those lethal sun rays.
Midnight Sun,"That being said, whatever a midnight sun actually is, its rays are pretty weak."
Midnight Sun,"It is a genetically modified sobfest, in which terminal illness looks like just another Instagram filter."
Midnight Sun,"With modest production values throughout, ""Midnight Sun"" feels like four or five episodes of a pretty good drama on the WB network in 1997. In other words, something you used to get for free."
Midnight Sun,"The authentic Sparks movies at least tend to be howlers, with shamelessly overcomplicated narratives and risible twists. Midnight Sun, on the other hand, is straightforward and trite."
Midnight Sun,"A preposterous film so insufferably adorable and frightfully melodramatic that viewers will find themselves confused as to which reflex to stifle: The urge to howl, or the one to hurl."
Midnight Sun,"Midnight Sun is cheesy and implausible and manipulative, but it did chip away at my cynicism through the sheer force of its corny and sincere heart."
Midnight Sun,"In slapsticky moments, you can tell she's working overtime to spark something, anything, but nothing catches fire in this Midnight Sun."
Midnight Sun,Save your money and your tissues.
Midnight Sun,"None of the film rings remotely true, especially the cornball conclusion, but the two young leads are so darn attractive and appealing that one can't help being caught up in their characters' poignant romance."
Midnight Sun,"Under the limp direction of Scott Speer, ""Midnight Sun"" suffocates its sentimental script, portraying passion without wonder, sacrifice without ecstasy."
Midnight Sun,"Schwarzenegger's chief skills are leaning against things, looking confused and having good hair, while Thorne struggles to convincingly lip sync."
Midnight Sun,"The trouble isn't just that ""Midnight Sun"" cherry-picks the most poetic elements of a real-world disease to serve its transparently manipulative ends, but that it offers audiences such an unrealistic portrait of romance in the process."
Midnight Sun,"Adolescent girls (and boys, too) are entitled to teen-tragedy tear-jerkers, those Kleenex-soaking tales of the fragility of life and love in an uncaring universe. But that audience deserves better than Midnight Sun."
Midnight Sun,Midnight Sun does what it means to do for the people it means to do it for-and that might just be enough.
Midnight Sun,A soapy YA romance that'll have you yearning for gritty edge of Twilight.
Midnight Sun,"Throughout, Midnight Sun's tone vacillates jarringly between corny, broad humor and unrestrained treacle."
Samson,"A bargain-bin biblical epic that delivers the requisite mass-murder-by-ass-jaw as a cheapjack approximation of Zack Snyder-esque pomp, but is for the most part clinically dull."
Samson,"The movie's most interesting clashes aren't between Samson and the Philistine royals, but between Pure Flix's intent to create ""clean"" entertainment and the obvious bloodthirstiness of the source material."
Samson,"While it cannot be faulted for its sincerity, it can be faulted for its sluggish pacing, inconsistent performances and lack of cinematic style that gives the proceedings a tacky feel throughout."
Samson,Perhaps...I am being too hard on a pretty okay movie that will make a lot of viewers happy.
Samson,A sluggish biblical epic that might have been more bearable if it had a much higher campiness quotient.
Samson,A respectful and heartfelt portrayal of a story whose power is undimmed over the millennia.
Eighth Grade,"Not since Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995) has a comedy captured so vividly the agony and the ecstasy-well, OK, it's all agony-of being a... teenage girl. [Full review in Spanish]"
Eighth Grade,Eighth Grade is a masterpiece.
Eighth Grade,The real genius of Eighth Grade is its universality - an honesty and compassion that cut across generational boundaries.
Eighth Grade,"There are moments of great darkness...Bo Burnham does a brilliant job of judging just how far to push any particular scene. And there is kindness, and joy, and the lurking underbelly of friendship."
Eighth Grade,"It's just sweet, sad and beautifully observed."
Eighth Grade,This is a film that gets under the skin of Generation X with humour and heartfelt emotion that makes it a genuinely great coming-of-age movie that hooks you by the heart.
Eighth Grade,A character study of singular sensitivity. Burnham and Fisher hit upon too many defining aspects of the young-teen experience to list
Eighth Grade,"[Director Bo] Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic."
Eighth Grade,"While Kayla Day is very much a teenager of her precise time and place, her gruelling anxiety - and Fisher's wonderful yearning in the role - make her universally relatable anyway."
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade is also deeply sweet in unexpected places and howlingly funny, attuned to the timeless indignities of any adolescence."
Eighth Grade,"Effortlessly brilliant, [Elsie Fisher] possesses the plucky, conflicted vulnerability of a young Amy Adams."
Eighth Grade,A beautifully observed exploration of adolescence in all its excruciating awkwardness and devastating uncertainties.
Eighth Grade,"Elsie Fisher is absolutely outstanding in the role of Kayla Day, like an undiscovered Fanning sister: her smart, observant performance gives the audience instant access to her vulnerabilities, hurt feelings and quiet determination."
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade doesn't capture the world ending, but never discredits the moments when Kayla feels like it could."
Eighth Grade,"The movie catches every marginal cringing embarrassment and each infinitesimal joy. Very little happens in it, and yet everything does."
Eighth Grade,One of the things I think works really well is that they show not only her perspective but her single fathers perspective.
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade is one of the most thoughtful and nuanced films made about the teenage experience, an authentic story of angst, anxiety and confusion - in other words, what it's like to be 13 years old."
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade is filled with insights, both humorous and painful. All the acting is fine, but Elsie Fisher is a revelation."
Eighth Grade,Burnham puts you through the wringer and ensures your empathetic excruciation in scene after scene.
Eighth Grade,"Lives spent looking at devices and screens is a reality for most of us, for better or worse; Eighth Grade is notable because it consciously avoids serving up a familiar media brew of technophobia and misogyny."
Eighth Grade,Eighth Grade beats back toxic masculinity with kindness.
Eighth Grade,A hilarious and often horrifying exploration of the trials of growing up.
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade is personal, uncomfortable, and lovely, a slice-of-life look into current adolescence, our reliance on social media, and growing into oneself."
Eighth Grade,Extremely well done.
Eighth Grade,Brilliantly elicits gulps of horrified recognition as it recreates the experience of that first teenage year... Eighth Grade is also a genuinely lovely story about a young woman not quite finding herself.
Eighth Grade,"Transports you to a very specific and tumultuous time - moving from middle to high school. Burnham makes you engage specifically with Kayla, but also hits all the right notes when sparking nostalgia and challenging the viewer to do some self-reflection."
Eighth Grade,"In addition to its queasy verisimilitude, ""Eighth Grade"" offers acute observations on how social media and the language of self-care have warped teen life."
Eighth Grade,"Despite having the best of intentions, Hollywood would have told this story differently. Burnham keeps it real."
Eighth Grade,"""Eighth Grade"" aces the test."
Eighth Grade,"Fisher's performance is nothing short of cringeworthy (high praise in this case). Still, the real delight is Hamilton's equally ungainly dad, who grows up faster than any of the kids in the picture."
Eighth Grade,"It's rare to see a movie about middle school years that looks and sounds as right as Eighth Grade, a modest charmer... Burnham avoids most of the Mean Girls-style tropes in favor of a more gently humorous and nuanced approach."
Eighth Grade,"Watching Eighth Grade, you want to gently shake Kayla-and your eighth-grade self-and assure her, ""It gets better."""
Eighth Grade,"An achingly honest film about some of the ghastliest years of adolescence. Funny, tender and endearing."
Eighth Grade,This is a movie that refuses to shy away from some fairly dark realities yet at the same time doesn't dwell on them in ways that feel exploitive or supercilious.
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade is a harrowing portrait of anxiety and acceptance in a post-social-media landscape, showing how all of us cope with an ever-changing, constantly refreshing world."
Eighth Grade,Elsie Fisher is a bright new discovery cementing herself as the Molly Ringwald for the Snapchat generation.
Eighth Grade,"As much as Burnham can be applauded, it's impossible not to clap even harder for the pitch-perfect acting of newcomer Elsie Fisher, a marvel in the lead role of an apparently unremarkable 13-year-old."
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade is a revelation of both a remarkably natural young performer and a clever, sensitive young filmmaker."
Eighth Grade,"An extraordinary movie about an ordinary girl named Kayla, ""Eighth Grade"" follows her through a final week of middle school."
Eighth Grade,"Burnham is clearly conflicted about the emotional effects of the constant comparisons, competitions and invidious voyeurism young people are subjecting themselves to nearly all day long. And he gets the subjective experience right."
Eighth Grade,I loved the look and simple but effective style of this film.
Eighth Grade,What most stunned me about 'Eighth Grade' was how well directed it is. It's rare that teen movies have the kind of visual acuity and verve that Burnham achieves here.
Eighth Grade,"""Eighth Grade"" turns out to be an appealingly generous portrait of adolescent awkwardness, also of parental awkwardness, though Josh Hamilton's fumbling dad is a keeper."
Eighth Grade,"Burnham's sociological precision as a screenwriter and director, however, would likely not feel as genuine if not for Fisher in the pivotal role of Kayla. She doesn't act the part as much as she breathes it."
Eighth Grade,Everybody who has been through eighth grade needs to see Eighth Grade.
Eighth Grade,"Burnham's filmmaking is unfussy yet thought through, so Fisher's seemingly artless performance is actually a pretty brilliant piece of acting."
Eighth Grade,"""Eighth Grade"" is a beautiful and uncompromising piece of art, from a distinctive new talent."
Eighth Grade,"The transition between junior high and high school is exhilarating, traumatic, funny and horrifying, and Bo Burnham's ""Eighth Grade"" captures the whole experience perfectly."
Eighth Grade,"It's special, and rare, to see such a complex yet understanding and respectful look at a young woman's life."
Eighth Grade,"In the film, you're so immersed in the awkwardness of Kayla's life, that her long, timid walk from the guest bathroom in her lime green one-piece to the pool almost makes you sweat with anxiety."
Eighth Grade,"""Eighth Grade"" is both revelatory and all-embracing."
Eighth Grade,"It's less a movie, and more a cringe-inducing, full-body flashback to the exquisite excruciation of being an adolescent."
Eighth Grade,"This movie feels genuine. It loves the characters, but it doesn't let them off the hook necessarily."
Eighth Grade,I was just surprised over and over again at how deeply touching it is while seeming effortlessly so.
Eighth Grade,Eighth Grade expertly captures those middle school growing pains every American kid for generations has endured.
Eighth Grade,"Startlingly empathetic, wincingly honest, and always completely charming."
Eighth Grade,"Writer-director Bo Burnham, in his feature debut, skillfully intertwines the timeless aspects of adolescent humiliation and the very particular ways in which today's tech has changed them."
Eighth Grade,Eighth Grade is so grounded in the reality of middle school it almost operates like a horrible collective flashback.
Eighth Grade,Many filmmakers have tried and failed to do what Burnham's achieved in this remarkable debut.
Eighth Grade,It is so viscerally authentic to the experience of being in middle school that for a moment I felt like I was standing in the lunchroom clutching my tray.
Eighth Grade,"Throughout, we're invited to chuckle at the ironies of Kayla's hobbies and activities, but underlying such scenes is a strain of eeriness, as if the film were offering up a post-human spin on Pretty in Pink."
Eighth Grade,"Poignantly funny, wrenchingly wise and meltingly beautiful, ""Eighth Grade"" is a not-so-small miracle of independent filmmaking."
Eighth Grade,The most authentic portrait of budding teenagerdom you're likely to see in theaters anytime soon.
Eighth Grade,"Every moment drips with aching - and, at times, heart-swelling - authenticity. The heart swelling is where the ugly cry kicks in."
Eighth Grade,"First-time director Bo Burnham's tender take on teen angst, starring an incandescent Elsie Fisher, is a flat-out triumph-a film that is both indelibly of the moment and achingly timeless."
Eighth Grade,"More than anything, this emotionally unsparing but never-punishing movie feels like the work of someone who kept his eyes and ears wide open."
Eighth Grade,"""Eighth Grade"" is a simple story of an unremarkable girl, tenderly and movingly told."
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade isn't easy, both on screen and in life, but it's a film that should be a rite of passage for all, no matter the age."
Eighth Grade,"Bo Burnham's funny and heartwarming 'Eighth Grade' is also a deeply serious film about female adolescence in the age of social media, with plenty of casual wisdom to spare."
Eighth Grade,"It's heartbreaking, heartwarming, and a total charmer."
Eighth Grade,"If there's a more haunting portrait of what it's like to grow up now, I'm not sure I could take it."
Eighth Grade,"A deeply kind movie, curious and nonjudgmental even about the characters who in most coming-of-age films would be hissable villains."
Eighth Grade,"[Burnham] smothers the story in sentiment, stereotypes, and good intentions."
Eighth Grade,"Fisher delivers a glorious symphony of awkward poignancy, from Kayla's cringe-worthy attempts to chat up a popular girl to her ultimately sweet connection with her kind, befuddled single dad."
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade is a brilliantly raw, honest portrayal about the middle school experience."
Eighth Grade,"[Elsie] Fisher is a real find, wielding the character's roller-coaster mood swings and open-wound insecurities with bravery and wit, and the supporting roles are equally convincing."
Eighth Grade,"Burnham's accomplished debut offers plenty for viewers of all ages, along with a filmmaking vision that is well beyond many of his comedy peers."
Eighth Grade,... a simultaneously harrowing and sweet look at early adolescence.
Eighth Grade,"It keeps threatening to become a cringe-fest, but pulls back, as Burnham opts instead for something more human and realistic. There's a lived-in wisdom in the film."
Eighth Grade,"Eighth Grade is lovely work, lifted up by a timeless piece of indie wisdom: Keep it real, as cringe-inducing as that can be."
Eighth Grade,"A lovely, truthful comedy about the pure nightmare that is junior high."
Eighth Grade,The kind of comedy that hipper parents might just be able to watch with their own offspring and enjoy.
Eighth Grade,Burnham has tapped into a byproduct of social-media-saturated adolescence that's often overlooked in favor of parental panic and worst-case-scenario horror stories.
Eighth Grade,"""Eighth Grade"" shines as, like, a totally spot-on, you know, portrait of Millennial angst and stuff."
Eighth Grade,"""Eighth Grade"" isn't a documentary, but it hews as close to the modern coming-of-age experience as currently seems possible."
Gosnell: The Trial of Ameri…,"The events in Searcy's film demand to be taken seriously. The way he portrays them, sometimes, cannot."
Gosnell: The Trial of Ameri…,"Tells a story worth telling, and does so reasonably well, but while it avoids actual preaching, it's still addressed to the choir. That doesn't make it a bad film, but it could have been a better one."
Gosnell: The Trial of Ameri…,The film never loses sight of the choir to which it is plainly preaching.
Blindspotting,"A mercurial and explosive film, Blindspotting nimbly parses conflicts about race, rent, incarceration and gentrification."
Blindspotting,"What could have been laboured and polemical is deftly handled, defused with comedy and powered by a pulsating score."
Blindspotting,"By equal turns tense and witty but with plenty of perceptive social commentary to go around, this is a film that only gets more rewarding the more you look under its surface."
Blindspotting,"Reportedly 10 years in the making, Blindspotting is a refreshingly original, gritty and stylised version of the typical rites-of-passage story."
Blindspotting,"It’s acted with naturalistic brio and the script, by Diggs and Casal, is full of pungent dialogue and nuanced reflections..."
Blindspotting,Try and take your electrified eyes off it. It's practically 2018: The Movie.
Blindspotting,"The film's spell grows and grows, perhaps because we're not sure exactly what the writers and first-time director Carlos López Estrada are preaching or promoting."
Blindspotting,"Blindspotting is the freshest commentary on race relations since Black Lives Matter, and in a film sense, since Do the Right Thing."
Blindspotting,One of my favorite movies I've seen so far this year.
Blindspotting,Blindspotting is a film audiences will be deconstructing for years to come. It's a film that wears its contemporary bent on its sleeve while simultaneously bemoaning how being contemporary has robbed the city of Oakland of its diversity.
Blindspotting,"This is a story that is fresh, funny and vital, the electrifying observational meditations at its center overflowing with a satirical edge that's frequently thrilling. I loved this movie. Full stop."
Blindspotting,"Racism, gentrification, police brutality, start-up culture, corporate branding, social media, the justice system ... Blindspotting is eager to take them all on with style and wit, and it succeeds more often than not."
Blindspotting,"""Blindspotting"" is directed with fervor by first-timer Carlos López Estrada, who brings its simmering tensions to a boil without letting the pot overflow."
Blindspotting,"[Casal and Diggs'] talent and charisma are all but undeniable, and their ambition is impossible not to admire, but their execution is confused - fatally so, from a storytelling standpoint."
Blindspotting,"See the movie, for its urgency, for its performances, and for the vibrant portrait of a community being erased in the names of progress and profit."
Blindspotting,Blindspotting is a compelling film with much to say about subjects like gentrification and race - things it approaches with a mix of wit and seriousness.
Blindspotting,"From the mean streets of Oakland, Calif., comes a story about friendship, race and class that's a veritable revelation suffused with authenticity and wisdom."
Blindspotting,"This is a movie that should be seen. You will think about it for a long time, wrestling with the questions it asks and doesn't always answer, at least not in a traditional way."
Blindspotting,"Funny, vibrant, insightful, tragic, achingly timely, and yet with an underlying message about empathy that is timeless, Blindspotting may be the summer's most essential movie."
Blindspotting,"Gentrification, police brutality and the prison industrial complex are just some of the many, many talking points Blindspotting grapples with in ways that are intimate, insightful and wildly entertaining - but also frequently frustrating."
Blindspotting,"The film's empathetic lens instills the feeling that the places on screen may already be gone by now, turning Blindspotting into a kind of documentary of the area that also shares its story: one of survival in the face of trauma."
Blindspotting,"A cathartic battle cry against police brutality and gentrification, and a sensitive, nuanced unpacking of race and identity"
Blindspotting,"'Blindspotting' has enough verve, humor, and passion to recommend it-even as it overplays its hand in its final minutes."
Blindspotting,"As the plot unfolds to lead us to this breaking point, it challenges its audience to overcome long-ingrained stereotypes that a black man is automatically a menacing figure."
Blindspotting,Blindspotting is a film about gentrification that never stops screwing with its audience.
Blindspotting,Blindspotting moves at a brisk pace and raises the dramatic stakes with each scene; director Estrada has a masterful touch for pacing.
Blindspotting,"Movies about race in America are seldom in short supply, but rarely do they venture past the realm of personal prejudice into the more complicated terrain of economic racism."
Blindspotting,"Like all great movies, Blindspotting is a force to be reckoned with and wrestled with. No matter where you land in your assessment, your expectations are guaranteed to be shattered."
Blindspotting,"Exceptional performances a gripping story, and a nuanced, sometimes poetic portrayal of issues of race, class, and friendship."
Blindspotting,"Still, it's hard to remember a recent movie that so powerfully distilled social issues into a single relationship."
Blindspotting,"Co-stars and co-writers Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal have a lot to say, much of it funny and/or provocative, but neither they nor first-time feature director Carlos López Estrada can figure out a way to shape all this material into a cohesive film."
Blindspotting,A timely meditation on what it means to be black and presumed guilty in America.
Blindspotting,Collin and Miles's relationship also allows the movie to carefully but confidently address some of the thornier realities that abstracted political and social arguments often sidestep for convenience's sake.
Blindspotting,"It's so incredibly tense and everything that did feel messy and scattered all of a sudden comes together in a way that does feel cohesive, and does feel focused, and does feel powerful in a way that perhaps it had not previously."
Blindspotting,"Estrada has made a vibrant film, one popping with ideas and ideals as it presents a vivid and complicated Oakland."
Blindspotting,"Two Oakland homies, 'Hamilton' star Daveed Diggs and poet Rafael Casal, create an intensely personal story about life on the edge in a rapidly changing city. Even when the plot fires off in too many directions, Diggs and Casal will keep you riveted."
Blindspotting,"Blindspotting is entertaining, but it also packs an emotional punch."
Blindspotting,The film takes aim at myriad targets and bluntly satirizing them in disparate styles that never mesh into a cohesive whole.
Blindspotting,"I unabashedly admire the movie's aims, and think ""Blindspotting"" ought to be seen by the widest audience possible."
Blindspotting,"Superb and daring ... a thrilling, riotous, language-drunk elegy and celebration for this most unfixed of cities."
Blindspotting,"An exuberant, brightly colored, zigzagging portrait of a city, an uneasy transformation and a friendship."
Blindspotting,"A spirited, thoughtful, thoroughly entertaining valentine to a city and its still-unfolding history, and a bracing reminder that two things can be true at the same time."
Blindspotting,Real-life friends Diggs and Casal must have less of an unstable dynamic than their characters; the two actors wrote Blindspotting together and perform a potentially fraught duet as its leads.
Blindspotting,"""Blindspotting"" will go down as one of the good things by which 2018 will be remembered. It's a serious work of passion, intuition and artistic intelligence."
Blindspotting,"In these trying times of urban change, police malfeasance, gun violence, racial strife and such, it's nice that Diggs, Casal and Blindspotting are sending a message from the front lines that confirms what you're experiencing and gives you a grain of hope."
Blindspotting,"The conflicts are schematic, the characters are thinly sketched, and Diggs displays his hip-hop artistry as if stepping upstage."
Blindspotting,"More than a treatise or answer key, it's a palpable blast of frustration and rage that shakes you - and should vault Diggs to the top of every casting agent's list."
Blindspotting,"Its dialogue is what's most brilliant about Blindspotting. Casal and Diggs use raps and rhymes interspersed with traditional discourse. It's not a straightforward story about present-day race relations, toxic masculinity, and immaturity by any means."
Blindspotting,A comedy-drama so caught up in its teachable moments that it often fails to come off like either.
Blindspotting,"The film's messy mix of flavorful, sometimes over-the-top character comedy and sincere racial politics benefits from the voice of its stars, who also wrote the script ..."
Blindspotting,"A raw, abrasive call for an adjustment in the way we see each other."
Blindspotting,"Still, Blindspotting, which was the heralded opening-night film at the festival, has an undeniable presence."
Blindspotting,"But as led by Daveed Diggs' impassioned, tormented performance, Blindspotting is hard to shake, despite its on-the-nose plot points and melodramatic flourishes."
Blindspotting,"The ultimate success of Blindspotting comes down to the intensity of emotion percolating beneath each scene, with Diggs' face exuding fury for an unjust world that has no use for his goodwill."
Blindspotting,"Estrada's debut feature brandishes a brash exuberance and stilted storytelling tropes in roughly equal measure, yielding a final result that stimulates just as it cheapens itself dramatically."
Blindspotting,"""Blindspotting"" encourages audiences to look beyond surface prejudices and really see their fellow citizens for the first time. If ever there was a film to open America's eyes, this is it."
Leave No Trace,"If the pacing occasionally slacks, “Leave No Trace” makes up for it in narrative twists and turns that shock without ever feeling exploitative."
Leave No Trace,"The superbly conceived documentary Leave No Trace sets about the task of revealing how the once-revered organization fell from grace, and it does so with a brutal clarity that’s one of its most potent weapons."
Leave No Trace,"Print journalism forbids reporters from writing in the first person. While documentary features are less rigid about those rules, it’s unorthodox, to say the least, to see one featuring one of its five credited producers so prominently."
Colette,ERROR
Operation Finale,"Well-intentioned, handsome, and lifeless."
Operation Finale,"Despite its engaging performances, this real-life story about Israel's hunt for a war criminal moves through rote plot points with uninventive efficiency."
Operation Finale,"When a movie features Ben Kingsley, in a hefty Ben Kingsley role, doing what Ben Kingsley does best, that's probably good enough in itself."
Operation Finale,The film fictionalizes setups and collapses factual details while trying to make Eichmann's extraction play out with conventional suspense; it ends up a poor cousin to Argo.
Operation Finale,
Operation Finale,"Operation Finale is a film perfectly suited for the beginning of September. It'll keep you engaged in the moment, yet will disappear completely by the time the real awards contenders pop up in a few weeks."
Operation Finale,"Ben Kingsley's serene, ""everybody sh*ts"" reading of the character is a source of illumination around which everything else in the picture revolves."
Operation Finale,"The markings here are of a fiery potboiler, but ""Operation Finale"" never ignites."
Operation Finale,It's in the movie's lengthy middle sequence of verbal sparring between Malkin and Eichmann that Operation Finale comes into its own.
Operation Finale,"The pacing is off from the first scenes, thick with exposition but skimpy on clarity."
Operation Finale,"Operation Finale has the too-slow-burn of Argo-lite. Best intentions aside, director Weitz simply can't seem to master the high-stakes gambit of what is essentially an international kidnapping."
Operation Finale,"The electrifying scenes between Kingsley and Isaac are even more riveting than the ""can they get him"" and ""will they be caught"" moments of spycraft."
Operation Finale,"A compelling if somewhat low-key historical thriller, elevated by fine performances from Kingsley and Isaac."
Operation Finale,"At its best, it's something to watch if nothing's on The History Channel; at its worst, [it's] a borderline banal representation of the banality of evil."
Operation Finale,"As a more complete retelling of a particular moment of history... the film is a diverting watch, anchored with enough of Weitz's intriguing personal touches to keep it from feeling like a glorified History Channel special."
Operation Finale,"Overall, Operation Finale tells its story without grossly distorting history and does so in a manner that engages an audience for its two hour running time."
Operation Finale,Director Chris Weitz... delivers a dialogue-driven think piece that makes up in intelligent nuance what it lacks in unrelenting thrills or suffocating suspense.
Operation Finale,"Yes, Malkin grabbed Eichmann, but the film about how it all went down does not return the favor."
Operation Finale,"Operation Finale, despite its other elaborations on the historical record, is engrossing and a little moving."
Operation Finale,"Operation Finale is gripping and involving - but more often, the story slows to a crawl and actually becomes less involving just when we should be holding our breath."
Operation Finale,"Tells a decent story well enough, but what does it want to say?"
Operation Finale,"It's neither great nor terrible, neither stylish nor unsexy, but exists in some serviceable compromise between both extremes."
Operation Finale,"A respectful chronicle of retribution, one that's suspenseful while resisting sensationalism."
Operation Finale,"What ultimately makes Operation Finale worth watching, if not exactly riveting, is the interplay between captor and prisoner."
Operation Finale,"To say Mr. Kingsley's performance is more than Eichmann deserves, of course, is really not saying anything -- it's a sturdy film, albeit about a shaky subject."
Operation Finale,The [Kingsley] and [Isaac] sequences aren't enough to make Operation Finale into what it desperately wants to be: a film that means something.
Operation Finale,"Rather than the cagey, caged mastermind who later would play dumb at trial, this Eichmann is just another movie bad guy - and Operation Finale is just another movie."
Operation Finale,Fails to measure up to the deep historical impact of the events it depicts.
Operation Finale,"A well-made spy thriller replete with scenes of secret surveillance, faked passports and hairbreadth escapes."
Operation Finale,"It's a story very worth telling, told pretty well, with self-evident virtues and obvious limitations."
Operation Finale,"The acting is great, but screenwriter Matthew Orton's attempts to give the film the philosophical heft that it deserves fall somewhat short."
Operation Finale,The film never manages to reconcile the enormity of the Holocaust with how ordinary a bureaucrat Eichmann was.
Operation Finale,This ostensibly historical account feels resoundingly Hollywood-phony.
Operation Finale,"Despite clichéd depictions of Nazi atrocities, the movie persuasively evokes, with its wealth of details, the slender threads on which historical events-and historical truth-depend."
Operation Finale,The drama benefits from a strong cast and can easily replace 1996's The Man Who Captured Eichmann as the go-to dramatization of this episode.
Operation Finale,The film is hobbled by a vision of Adolf Eichmann that doesn't find a way to touch his interior life so much as it preserves his mystique as an office manager in evil wolf's clothing.
Operation Finale,"""Operation Finale"" doesn't feel ambiguous so much as it feels like it lacks a point of view."
Operation Finale,A film that doesn't have the philosophical depth to back up its analytical ambitions.
Operation Finale,The reason the movie works as well as it does is its two stars: Oscar Isaac and Ben Kingsley.
Operation Finale,"Kingsley isn't an ideal match for the mild-mannered murderer who inspired Hannah Arendt to coin the phrase ""the banality of evil."" But like the rest of the cast, he holds our attention even when the movie buckles under the burden of earnest intentions."
I Can Only Imagine,[A] slickly assembled tale of redemption and reconciliation.
I Can Only Imagine,"Art can be affirmation, but affirmation cannot be art."
I Can Only Imagine,"The movie works for the same reason the song does: It lightens the burden of the pain people are shouldering today, and gives them something to look forward to."
I Can Only Imagine,"This is an interesting idea, executed with a reductive, tin-eared understanding of what constitutes art to go along with a faith-based movie's reductive, tin-eared understanding of what constitutes entertainment."
I Can Only Imagine,"Like so many faith-based efforts, I Can Only Imagine suffers from a terminal case of self-importance."
I Can Only Imagine,"Why is the movie made from a universally healing single such an earnest, awkward dud? Well, partly because the movie can't settle on what's more important, the family stuff or the ascension of the song as a fame-inducing anthem."
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird combines wisdom and tenderness, humor and grace. It's light-footed without being lightweight. And it captures, with great feeling, the turbulence of a girl growing up. I can't recommend it enough."
Lady Bird,"Greta Gerwig's directorial debut, Lady Bird, is the millisecond of possibility, the speck of unflinching nerve, which might only occur once in our lives."
Lady Bird,"It is a female coming-of-age story that is both nostalgic and unflinching, and it will ensnare you deeply in its grasp."
Lady Bird,The densely packed detail which makes this such a luminous work shows Gerwig to be an uncommonly alert filmmaker.
Lady Bird,One of the finest teen comedies ever. Movie perfection
Lady Bird,One element of the film's genius is its ability to root us firmly in Lady Bird's perspective. It does more.
Lady Bird,"Its joyful, forward-rushing narrative rhythm captures the feeling of adolescence ending before it has barely begun."
Lady Bird,"As teen movies go, it's supremely sophisticated, capturing and crystallising that moment in adolescence when it seems that life is at last about to start and the only place you want to be is elsewhere."
Lady Bird,"While there is an acute authorial intelligence informing the transitions between scenes, the steady trot of clipped vignettes comes to seem monotonous and somewhat evasive, a way to move along before anything too hard and hurtful happens."
Lady Bird,"Like many wonderful actresses with a gift for words (think Julie Delpy, Sarah Polley and Lake Bell) Gerwig has slipped behind the camera to create something quietly political."
Lady Bird,"Gerwig's deft handling of script, camera and actors is all the more impressive given that this is her first film as solo director."
Lady Bird,"This is a coming-of-age story that's affecting without ever being sentimental, and feels absolutely true -- like remembering the teenager you once were, even if you were never a Lady Bird (or Debee) exactly. A rare bird indeed."
Lady Bird,A gloriously funny and wistfully autobiographical coming-of-age comedy.
Lady Bird,"If Gerwig is capable of all this in her first solo feature, who knows what feats of woodwork she'll craft for us next."
Lady Bird,Writer-director Gerwig manages brilliantly the delicate feat of portraying the vulnerabilities and eccentricities of the townsfolk without patronising them.
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird is an absolute charmer of a movie. We genuinely care about this lovely, rebellious girl and we want her to be happy."
Lady Bird,"It's almost too hard to write about Lady Bird precisely because it's so brilliant that no words could possibly capture its spirit and convey why this film absolutely has to be seen, and loved."
Lady Bird,"A coming-of-age story like no other, Lady Bird is smart, emotional, funny and completely original. Rarely has a directorial debut been so assured, so singular and so heartwarmingly affecting."
Lady Bird,"Almost everything here bespeaks Gerwig, including the cast's tendency to act one line or dramatic moment with breezy brio, as if already on the run to the next. Very GG."
Lady Bird,"The characters may be messy, but Gerwig's writing and direction are elegantly precise. One of the best ensemble casts of the year."
Lady Bird,The key to Lady Bird is that Marion is never painted as an ogre. Her toughness is played for comic effect: as an understandable character flaw born of her genuinely meaning well.
Lady Bird,"Gerwig finds a warmer part of herself when, unencumbered by any lab partner, she returns to her hometown with Lady Bird. One can only hope that, this time, she stays."
Lady Bird,A heartfelt coming-of-age story that perfectly captures the bittersweet transition from adolescence to dawning adulthood...
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird's center is the relationship between Christine and her mother, and Metcalf's performance is a knockout."
Lady Bird,"If Gerwig's cinematic brand is going to be tenderness, feminism, spiky humor, and empathy, count me in."
Lady Bird,"""Lady Bird"" is a deeply accomplished debut, as much a love letter to Gerwig's hometown as it is to awkward adolescence. It flies."
Lady Bird,"Lots of movies are set to be popping up in multiplexes, but few as wonderful as ""Lady Bird."""
Lady Bird,One of the best movies about adolescence to come along in years.
Lady Bird,"... I love this movie, and it's hard not to believe that general audience who head to the theatre to give it a look will not end up feeling exactly the same."
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird understands late adolescence as the endless accumulations of tiny humiliations and a deep, unutterable yearning for escape."
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird may sound slight, but it offers an eloquent, fresh voice from a thoroughly accomplished film-maker."
Lady Bird,"The delightful and insightful Lady Bird achieves flight in its own unique way, just like the aerodynamically unorthodox ladybug the title tips to."
Lady Bird,Lady Bird is a coming-of-age story distinguished by a great script and a perfect cast.
Lady Bird,"Highlighted by an awards-worthy performance by Saoirse Ronan and structured around a light, witty script by Gerwig, the movie delivers a well-targeted snapshot of a year-in-the-life of an ordinary high school senior."
Lady Bird,"It's unique and original and fresh and wonderful, and can you tell I loved it?"
Lady Bird,Saoirse Ronan plays Lady Bird as if she'd been following writer-director Greta Gerwig around all her life - mannerisms and liberated worldview fully internalized.
Lady Bird,Greta Gerwig proves that she is her own muse
Lady Bird,It's a great movie.
Lady Bird,"In Ronan's marvelous performance, tough and transparent at the same time, we can see the blurred outlines of the equally assured filmmaker behind her."
Lady Bird,"""Lady Bird"" is a triumph of style, sensibility and spirit. The girl at its center may not be a heavyweight, but her movie is epic."
Lady Bird,"I love it. If a more enchanted movie comes along this year, I'll be surprised."
Lady Bird,This is simply beautiful work.
Lady Bird,"As an actor, Gerwig has shown an enchantingly light touch; she brings that to her work as director, as ""Lady Bird"" skims along happily, showing us moments both crucial and trivial in a teenage girl's life."
Lady Bird,Greta Gerwig has reclaimed the narrative around virginity - and it's all the better for it.
Lady Bird,"Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age film is deft, joyous, and imaginatively sympathetic"
Lady Bird,"Gerwig the actress skillfully pivots between the wacky and the poignant, so it's no surprise that Gerwig the auteur so delicately balances hilarity and heartbreak."
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird is, instead, episodic and rambling, a ruminative look back at a crucial, defining period in its creator's life."
Lady Bird,"Witty and wise, hopeful and heartbreaking."
Lady Bird,"There's an easy yet unnerving authenticity in Lady Bird, making it feel like a welcoming yet soul-baring memoir."
Lady Bird,"A finely wrought, deeply felt mash note to Gerwig's hometown of Sacramento, and the rare film about teenage life that puts equal weight on the dark, sad and tough parts, as it does on the joyous, raucous, euphoric moments."
Lady Bird,It hit me unexpectedly-like a snowball between the eyes.
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird is a masterpiece. Affecting, emotional, funny, painful. It'll make you feel things and transport you to a time you thought you'd gotten over."
Lady Bird,"The movie is best when it undercuts its own seriousness, as when Lady Bird proclaims, ""I want to be the best version of who I can be,"" and then follows up with, ""What if this is the best version?"""
Lady Bird,It isn't every day you see a film so attuned to the outsized drama of adolescent life. The film is bursting with life and rich in observations both large and small. Kudos to Gerwig and all of her collaborators
Lady Bird,"[Gerwig's] first solo flight as a director and writer is beautifully confident in its rhythm and mood, the script whip-sawing from humor to earnest emotion to raw pain and back."
Lady Bird,Lady Bird finds fresh purchase in well-trodden territory by observing the human carnival from a girl's point of view.
Lady Bird,"It may be about the selfishness and growing pains of its confused and embattled heroine, but it's made from the perspective of an artist who sees the world more clearly now than she did then."
Lady Bird,"It's funny, lively, and then devastating when it needs to be, made with the kind of confidence even its heroine could only dream of."
Lady Bird,"Left to her own devices, Gerwig has arrived and solidified her place as one of the most invigorating, observant and authentic voices in movies today with a director's acumen to match."
Lady Bird,"... Gerwig is by far one of the most talented filmmakers working today, both onscreen and behind the camera, confident and winsome in a way nearly unparalleled by her contemporaries."
Lady Bird,"... the dialogue in ""Lady Bird"" is consistently and honestly funny and cliché-free."
Lady Bird,One of the better solo directing debuts by an actor in recent memory.
Lady Bird,"The loosely autobiographical Lady Bird is actress-writer Greta Gerwig's solo directorial debut, and it feels like the fullest realization so far of her already-patented brand of gangly bittersweet whimsy."
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird is both generous and joyous, but when it stings, it stings deep."
Lady Bird,"Greta Gerwig is spreading her wings as a filmmaker - and she soars with ""Lady Bird."""
Lady Bird,"As warm as it is smart - and it is very smart - ""Lady Bird"" marks actor/screenwriter Greta Gerwig's superb debut as a solo director and yet another astonishing performance by star Saoirse Ronan."
Lady Bird,"Once you've seen it-even while you're watching it, with a grin stuck on your face-you want to give thanks for how wonderful it is, how wise and funny and full of grace."
Lady Bird,"One of the best films of the year. In telling her own coming of age story, Gerwig proves herself a blazing talent and Ronan and Metcalf should have Oscar calling. Totally irresistible."
Lady Bird,"If you pay the right kind of attention to ""Lady Bird"" - absorbing its riffs and digressions as well as its melodies, its choral passages along with its solos and duets - you will almost certainly love it. It's hard not to."
Lady Bird,"[Saorise] Ronan's accent is American, but there's Irish in her rhythms, in the way she drives her lines home and turns every full stop into an ellipsis, a fierce demand for more."
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird is a perfect coming-of-age comedy for anyone who's ever had teenage wanderlust, fought with their parents, fostered a love-hate tension with their hometown or popped Communion wafers in secret."
Lady Bird,"[Lady Bird] is a shrewd, warm, witty coming-of-age movie."
Lady Bird,"As writer and director, Greta Gerwig infuses this comedic coming-of-age drama with verbal virtuosity, gestural idiosyncrasy, and emotional vitality."
Lady Bird,"Gerwig's directorial debut is a joy from start to finish, a warm, generous snapshot of teenage vulnerability and exuberance."
Lady Bird,A hilarious and heartwarming experience.
Lady Bird,"A uniquely American comedy, Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird is testy, humane, and firmly rooted in its time and place."
Lady Bird,"Gerwig has proven that she's equally adept behind the camera, allowing her personal experiences to inform this upbeat, charming coming-of-age comedy."
Lady Bird,"What a joy, then, to discover that [Greta Gerwig] is equally capable at flooding a film with twisted livewire complexity."
Lady Bird,"There are no fireworks or twists or unnecessary frills here, nor should there be - this is simply perfect filmmaking from a voice that demands to be heard."
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird is something truly special: a coming-of-age comedy so funny, perceptive, and truthful that it makes most other films about adolescence look like little more than lessons in cliché."
Lady Bird,"Lady Bird is a film bursting with warmth, wit and melancholy that manages to seem fresh and unexpected despite the overly stacked nature of the subgenre."
Lady Bird,"This is a resoundingly modern, assuredly female-voiced comedy that portends more great things to come from Gerwig behind the camera."
Lady Bird,"Snappy, spirited and shot through with the pangs and pleasures of leaving childhood behind, Lady Bird is a sharp-witted solo first feature by actress and now writer-director Greta Gerwig."
Lady Bird,"""Lady Bird"" consolidates the style and sensibility of a generation caught between the last gasp of the 20th century and post-9/11 disillusionment like nothing else before."
Lady Bird,"The kind of modest, miraculous low-budget gem that takes on a life of its own."
Lady Bird,"A sweet, deeply personal portrayal of female adolescence that's more attuned to the bonds between best girlfriends than casual flings with boys, writer-director Greta Gerwig's beautiful Lady Bird flutters with the attractively loose rhythms of youth."
Gotti,"'Listen to me, and listen to me good. You never gonna see another guy like me if you live to be five thousand,' Travolta's Teflon Don boasts in the final scene. With any luck, we'll never see another mob-movie misfire like this either."
Gotti,"A comically terrible imitation of a biopic, directed by Kevin Connolly with all the flair and nuance of a movie-within-a-movie on 'Entourage.'"
Gotti,He looks distractingly terrible at every stop...You never forget that you are watching John Travolta playing John Gotti every time.
Gotti,It's more run-of-the-mill than it is colossally misguided.
Gotti,"Gotti tries too hard to cram too much information into a small space, and you come away learning almost nothing about the man, other than the filmmakers feel he was a pretty stand-up guy."
Gotti,"You might think this sounds hilariously bad. It must be so bad it's kind of good, right? Wrong. Gotti is not remotely fun, even ironically."
Gotti,It's not a good movie. But the blame can't be laid at its star's Ferragamo-shod feet.
Gotti,"I'd rather wake up next to a severed horse head than ever watch ""Gotti"" again."
Gotti,Starring in this mobster biopic that deserves to get whacked is an offer Travolta should have refused. Insane testimonials from Gotti supporters at the end are as close as this s---show will ever get to good reviews.
Gotti,"Gotti is a connect-the-dots disaster -- the don's greatest hits, so to speak -- without discernible theme or cohesive narrative."
Gotti,"When Gotti tells viewers, speaking directly to the camera at film's end, that they'll never see another man like him, an attorney should really spring up and object that the statement assumes facts not in evidence."
Gotti,"Closing reportage of everyday New Yorkers brashly extolling Gotti's virtues upon his death, painting him, without any irony, as some kind of local hero, pretty much tells you where this picture's coming from."
Gotti,That the long-gestating crime drama Gotti is a dismal mess comes as no surprise. What does shock is just how multifaceted a dismal mess it is.
Gotti,"He may have been a murderer, but even Gotti deserved better than this."
Gotti,"Aside from the wardrobe and the makeup, ""Gotti"" falls far short of capturing period-piece details and never immerses us in the era."
Gotti,It's almost laughable to see this iconic star trying so hard on behalf of a movie that is so clearly compromised in its intentions.
Gotti,"The problem is that it's not really anything. This is a strange thing to say about a notorious mob boss who was locked up for murder, but John Gotti deserved better."
Gotti,"The film is pretty terrible: poorly written, devoid of tension, ridiculous in spots and just plain dull in others."
The Rider,An extraordinary translation of life into art.
The Rider,"Bold, heartfelt and, most importantly, unafraid, this is a remarkable film."
The Rider,The Rider reshapes the traditional cowboy narrative in a way that both embraces and challenges western tropes.
The Rider,A hugely impressive slice of prairie naturalism.
The Rider,"Working with non-professional actors from the Pine Ridge community, Zhao tells the fictionalised true story of bareback bronc rider Brady Blackburn."
The Rider,"Jandreau proves a charismatic draw, even if some of the supporting non-actors struggle with naturalistic performances."
The Rider,"A remarkable film in many respects, and Zhao works wonders with a non-professional cast."
The Rider,What is most startling here is the sensitivity with which [director Chloé] Zhao tackles such a downbeat tale.
The Rider,"The Rider could easily have been pitying or patronising but it is suffused instead with warmth, understanding and insightful detail"
The Rider,"Not fiction; not documentary. Instead, a story standing under a chimerical moon while fate, laconic and inarticulate like its victims, growls from far off."
The Rider,"A thoughtful and thought-provoking look at identity, aspiration and a precarious way of life, this is anchored by a stunning performance by Brady Jundreau and inspired direction by Chloé Zhao."
The Rider,There is minimalistic elegance to this film that couldn't help but blow me away.
The Rider,"Brady, rarely raising his voice above a murmur, takes us on an emotional journey, figuring out his own way forward. The plains go on forever; so, we hope, does hope."
The Rider,"My my, what a ride."
The Rider,"Cinema that's challenging and offbeat is always in danger of being overlooked. But ""The Rider"" deserves to be seen."
The Rider,"Jandreau, acting opposite his real-life family members and friends, disappears into a role largely based on his own experiences, oozing empathy from his pores."
The Rider,"You can almost feel the wind and smell the dust of the South Dakota plains, so deeply is Chlo Zhao's new film steeped in the reality of its environment."
The Rider,"[Chloe] Zhao lyrically frames the characters within the shots, making them seem part of the landscape. Everything and everyone are natural parts of the images..."
The Rider,It's just plain excellent.
The Rider,"You will want to be there, pulling for Brady, no matter what choices he makes. More importantly, you will care about those choices, and about him."
The Rider,Zhao turns material that might have been treacly and simple-minded into an allegory of male identity...with the quality of myth.
The Rider,"It's a kind of parable, delivered in a manner that has nothing to do with preaching."
The Rider,"""The Rider"" reinvigorates tropes from the western genre of men, horses, honor codes and vast expanses of nature with a refreshing lack of sentimentality, without sacrificing their inherent lyricism and poetry."
The Rider,"The movie is soulful, elegant, filmed as often as not at the magic hour, when the sky is as broad as it is orange-yellow, and every nook of the world seems alight with possibility."
The Rider,"But as wrenching as The Rider can be at times, it's also suspenseful and beautiful - a modern-day Western with a hero who's a real discovery."
The Rider,"Simplicity is not in vogue among today's filmmakers, but The Rider is so consistently good that it has wowed critics and audiences on the film festival circuit. Just don't approach it with outsized expectations."
The Rider,"Zhao seems to have filmed with her head down, focussed on her screenplay, rather than up, focussed on the richness of what was taking place around her."
The Rider,"Filmmaker Chlo Zhao turns the story of real-life bronc rider Brady Jandreau into a gritty, graceful character study. Once The Rider hooks you - and believe me, it will - there's no way you will ever forget it."
The Rider,"A neo-Western about rodeo riding, hobbled masculinity and reflective grace that feels unlike anything else out there."
The Rider,"It's a rare treat to be so affected by-and connected to-a movie hero of so few words, and such vivid ones."
The Rider,"What really distinguishes [Zhao's] work here is something beyond great filmmaking chops: a vision that is deeply humanistic, founded on a compassionate realism that honors the heartfelt struggles of all the creatures it encounters."
The Rider,Ms. Zhao's commitment to her craft - she knows how to take care and when to take risks - matches Brady's.
The Rider,The Rider is the best film I've seen so far in 2018. It also feels like the announcement of a major artistic talent in Zhao.
The Rider,"A vista-worshipping, socially observant, and altogether moving exploration of how difficult it is to be wise even when the alternative is statistically guaranteed death."
The Rider,"Achieves a nearly perfect balance between what's engineered and what's observed, allowing everyone on screen to embody their own messy lives while keeping them corralled to a compelling and tightly structured (if somewhat familiar) narrative."
The Rider,"[Chloe] Zhao and ""The Rider"" are the real deal."
The Rider,"""The Rider"" comes as close to a spiritual experience as anything I've encountered in a movie theater this year."
The Rider,One of the year's most arresting and unforgettable films.
The Rider,"The occasional lyrical music that over-pounds the film's mournful tone. Nevertheless, it's a remarkable achievement from both Zhao and all her actors."
The Rider,"Zhao's film derives its power from the truth that both drives it and inspires it, and the final result is a wholly unique slice-of-life drama."
The Rider,"It manifests a mounting sense of disillusionment, suggesting that the rodeo lifestyle many characters so unreservedly romanticize often leads to physical and psychological ruin."
The Rider,[Chlo] Zhao's artful look into the American West is a lightly brooding winner. Clearly this isn't her first time at the rodeo.
The Rider,"In telling the story of a disappearing slice of America, Zhao has created a portrait of resilience, and the bonds that last even after the rodeo's over."
The Rider,The Rider marries the majestic vistas of the greatest American westerns with a deeply interior story of a cowboy having to renegotiate his identity.
The Rider,"Heavy-hearted cowboys, wild horses and broken dreams: The Rider is a great film about what it means to be a man."
The Rider,"Movies that blend real life and fiction usually foreground the docu-style realism, using the poetry as grace notes or punctuation. Zhao privileges both, and in so doing creates a work of heartbreaking beauty."
The Rider,Gains artful integrity from Zhao's favored docu-fiction technique - roughly tracing a script around the experiences of her non-professional actors - and dusty-dreamy visual style.
The Rider,"It's a very impressive, very accomplished film."
The Rider,"Zhao's story may strain as it edges down familiar routes, but its emotional connections pulsate throughout, making this a natural for festival and arthouse play to Zhao's growing fanbase."
The Rider,Beautifully captures the way a handful of people stoically deal with the meager hands life has dealt them.
Nobody’s Fool,"The movie is bad in all the ways Perry's movies are usually bad - it's haphazardly paced, riddled with plot holes, and thuddingly overstated in its moralizing - but that doesn't matter whenever Haddish is onscreen."
Nobody’s Fool,"You feel like you're the victim of a cruel bait-and-switch, lured into thinking Nobody's Fool would be a crappy but nevertheless entertaining Tiffany Haddish movie, only to have it turn out to be a crappy but nevertheless crappy Tyler Perry movie."
Nobody’s Fool,"It's something like five movies in one. Or maybe it's five movies in two. Or six movies in three. It's a mess, whatever it is, but it's not without its charms."
Nobody’s Fool,"Too much of ""Nobody's Fool"" makes do with well-worn exchanges and contrived, overheard conversations."
Nobody’s Fool,"Once again, Perry puts a good cast into a muddy story that lacks a clear premise, plot or theme."
Nobody’s Fool,"Even with all of Haddish's hard work, she still can't clean up the mess she's landed in."
Nobody’s Fool,"[Sumpter] and Haddish make a likable pair, but Perry never quite works them into a functioning comedy team."
Nobody’s Fool,Nobody's Fool wastes its comic goodwill and performances by wallowing in the same tired story elements Tyler Perry has been milking on TV and in his movies for decade.
Nobody’s Fool,"If the movie's looseness lets in an excess of dead air, ""Nobody's Fool"" is still dotted with pleasures besides those Haddish brings."
Nobody’s Fool,"Given that this is the auteur's 20th theatrical feature film, there's no longer any excuse for the pacing issues, the scenes that don't end and the general flaccidness of his direction."
Nobody’s Fool,Few mainstream romantic comedies are so brazen or as unconvincing in their third acts.
Nobody’s Fool,"It's another Tyler Perry film with a lot of lessons, and I don't want to come off like I'm looking down on that (which I don't), but good lessons don't necessarily add up to a good movie."
Nobody’s Fool,"An uneven, but forgivable, romantic comedy, Tyler Perry's ""Nobody's Fool"" is fine once it settles into its groove and decides what it wants to be."
The Miracle Season,"You want emotion? See if you can handle this inspirational sports drama, whose every scene is calculated to make young hearts explode."
The Miracle Season,"The Miracle Season is pleasantly swift, but in a quest for ruthless efficiency, a few character beats are skipped."
The Miracle Season,This movie goes for the heartstrings and tear ducts more than the sports-conscious. The results are pretty mixed.
The Miracle Season,"A simple movie of straightforward sentimentalism and gung-ho, against-all-odds inspiration."
The Miracle Season,"The underlying story here is powerful enough that it sells itself. The best thing about ""The Miracle Season"" is it lets that story unfold and doesn't do anything to stand in its way."
The Miracle Season,It simply wallows too deeply in its grief to be uplifting.
The Miracle Season,"It's no champion, but it's still a reasonably good cry."
The Miracle Season,"High school volleyball is not an exciting sport to watch on a big screen. At least not the way ""Miracle"" director Sean McNamara presents it."
The Miracle Season,"This dramatization of a true story is long on sentiment, short on character and drama."
The Miracle Season,"It is not unusual for an underdog sports picture to be predictable. But The Miracle Season seems downright preordained, and not just in its arc."
The Miracle Season,It's downright depressing to see Oscar winners Hunt and Hurt struggling to make something meaningful out of their superficially written characters.
The Miracle Season,"Godawful, even by the standards of sports dramas, where healthy doses of manipulation and hagiography are accepted as part of the inspirational formula."
The Miracle Season,"""The Miracle Season"" is a pleasant surprise, the rare inspirational sports movie that actually earns its tears."
The Miracle Season,"Mistakes an inspiring true story for one that needs or deserves to be told cinematically; it isn't awful, but it's not a film, it's a tribute."
The Miracle Season,"From lighting to music cues, ""The Miracle Season"" never misses a chance to lunge for your tear ducts, treating its characters less as flesh-and-blood humans than as props for delivering bromides."
The Miracle Season,"Even if you see through the benign (manipulative) strategies of ""The Miracle Season,"" which isn't hard to do, resistance is futile. You will surrender."
